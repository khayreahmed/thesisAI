Every company will be an AI company. Every startup needs an AI strategy - not just for fundraising or press appeal. User expectations have changed. When one email composer window autocompletes sentences, every email product will need to follow. When one customer support bot provides a meaningfully better experience to answer questions, every competitor will match it. ChatGPT & Midjourney have educated hundreds of millions that we can & should expect more from software. Now those teeming masses will demand it. How quickly users switch from one product to another depends on the category of software : the switching costs, the pain associated with a lack of the feature, or the loss in productivity without it. Today, there are three different levels of AI strategy: single feature : autocompletion of text or code within a text editor department level : automated customer support agent core to the product : an image generation business that builds a proprietary large language model Most businesses will likely adopt the first & as the technologies mature, the second. Newer businesses will pursue the third as a competitive advantage as they reimagine workflows. Many core software products map real world workflows to software ; these will change. Text & chat UIs will change those expectations : imagine developing a project management plan in a conversation with a computer or reconciling expenses by dictating an answer to a mobile phone. These new user interfaces will change software. It may be easy to dismiss an AI strategy as a fundraising tactic (yet another AI company), but the trope underscores a meaningful shift in what ultimately matters : User expectations have evolved & every business will need to meet their demands to thrive.

In The Figures that Will Move the Venture Capital Market in the Next 3-5 Years , I wrote about the correlation between interest rates & venture capital investing. In the past two years, the correlation has grown stronger from -0.46 correlation to -0.51. The correlation is strong enough to build a simple prediction of early stage venture capital activity in 2023. This simple model uses the 10 year bond rate plus the amount of early stage venture capital raised in the previous year. The chart above shows the predicted invested in grey & actuals in orange. The model has a very small p-value with a pretty strong correlation R^2 of 0.63 for only 2 variables. The model predicts about $30b in early stage VC in 2023 (assuming a 10 year rate of 3.7%). This is likely a conservative figure. About one third of the way through the year, early stage VCs have invested about $16.5b according to PitchBook data, which would imply about $55b for the full year. In 2022, startups raised about $75b from VCs. A number between $30b-55b would imply 30%-60% reduction in the early stage market. I expect valuations across the industry to fall roughly in line with that number. But it might be a bit less since the most competitive financings particularly in AI have been clearing at 2021 valuations, & the mountain of dry powder (more than $500b raised for early venture in the last 3 years) will buoy valuations through competition. Should the Fed decide to cut rates ( the bond market suggests so) [1], perhaps some smaller quantum of the euphoria of 2021 may return to venture investing. –
[1] The Fed Funds rate is the interest rates banks pays to borrow from the government overnight. It’s at 5% today. The 2-year Treasury (the rate which the government pays to borrow money for 2 years) is around 3.8%. That means the market “believes” that in 2 years the Fed Funds rate will be at 3.8%, falling 1.2% in the next 24 months.

For each of the 14 weeks, more people searched for ChatGPT than Taylor Swift according to Google Trends data. You won’t find people outside of tech hubs googling for microservices or layer 2 blockchains or serverless databases with any great frequency. But Minnesotans & Idahoans & Vermontans are searching for ChatGPT. People are curious about AI. They want to test it, prod it, break it, be surprised by it. For startups, this inquisitiveness is a wonderful thing. Millions of people want to try new products, all at once, to answer the question : how could AI help me with my email, my homework, my music creation, my graphic design, my data analysis, my plumbing business? Platform shifts arouse curiosity. In 2008, after the iPhone app store launched, we asked each other, is there an app for that? We sought out software that would change the way we live. Over the next year or so, we will all ask each other, what could AI do for me? And a bot will answer : “Nice to meet you, where you been? I could show you incredible things.” These moments don’t come around that often. Seizing it could mean acquiring millions of new users who will want to use software in new ways.

Blockchains are databases application developers use to build novel user experiences . Just as hundreds of different databases exist in web2, different blockchains have evolved in web3. In September, I published the State of Web3 in Data . I’ve been watching one of those charts very closely : slide 25 which tracked L2s & L1s. Layer 2s (or L2s) like Arbitrum & Optimism, sit atop Ethereum (an L1). They provide faster & less expensive transactions for application developers. The average Ethereum transaction costs about $2.60 as of this writing, whereas on Arbitrum it costs $0.07 , a 97% savings. For an individual transaction, the difference may not matter, but for application developers & frequent traders, those dollars accumulate over time.  In the long-term, lower prices will drive more activity, essential for broader adoption of web3 technologies. In September, L2s processed about 30% of Ethereum transactions. Six months later, that figure is 67% according to Dune . Within the Ethereum ecosystem, this number should asymptote to 90-95%. Economics works - even in the sometimes strange world of web3. As web3 evolves, we will see more instances of economics driving behavior : the evolution of token drops to more efficient marketing strategies because airdrops are uneconomical compared to classic venture rounds. developers choosing particular blockchains for applications based on workload including more expensive, more secure databases called zero-knowledge (zk) in web3 or less expensive faster databases like L2s revenue as a core driver of valuation in web3 startups & publics

There are 4 questions a startup should ask themselves about building a startup that uses generative AI. I presented those questions & my views on their answers at Saastr’s Workshop Wednesday . I had a blast putting this deck together. I started with a few sentences, uploaded them to gamma.app to outline the presentation, popped over to Midjourney to generate images along  the story line, & published it in IA Presenter . The video is here . The last slide contains the prompts for the images in the presentation. The narrative is : AI is a massive platform change that Goldman Sachs projects will increase GDP 300x more than the PC. GS estimates a 1.5-2.9% increase to US GDP, doubling GDP growth, net of 7% job loss. The PC increased GDP by 0.006%, according to NBER That alone should turn heads. There are 4 questions startups should ask themselves about building with generative AI. Layer : application, platform, or infrastructure? In the cloud, AWS, Azure, & GCP have created about as much market cap as all the top 100 B2B & B2C publics built on cloud (Netflix, ServiceNow, AirBnb, etc). But there are 100 applications compared to 3 infrastructure vendors. Market : how to compete with incumbents? Startups have negative time to launch in many markets with Adobe, Microsoft, & Salesforce launching Gen AI enabled software in weeks. Moats : how to develop competitive advantage? Competing on algorithms is possible but hard. Access to proprietary data provides a moat. Usage & distribution, like in classical SaaS, are likely the most sustainable & repeatable. Enterprise readiness will be an essential : ensuring buyers are safe from legal & compliance risks. AI Depth : what level of technical sophistication to bring into the company? Startups can integrate with a plug-in, build a prompt-tuning engine (a little model on top of a bigger model), or develop & train their own models. Each subsequent choice is more expensive, but provides a deeper moat. It’s likely startups start at plug-ins & then move down with scale that affords more usage & more capital to invest. If you’re building in the space, I’d love to hear from you .

I’m thrilled to announce the debut of Theory Ventures & our first fund of $230m. I’ve spent my career as a student of startups. I’ve worked for two, invested in many, seven of which became unicorns.  I study them, benchmark them, analyze them, interview their leaders to understand their mechanics & share what I’ve learned on this blog. The throughline of my work has been in identifying technological discontinuities that enable go-to-market advantages, & it’s patently clear to me that we are in the midst of another revolution now . I aim to continue this work for many years at Theory Ventures. Theory is deliberately named. Thesis investing is at our core. We aim to research ideas, develop informed perspectives, & ply those insights to support founders from their earliest stages. These are the three of the first key thesis areas for Theory : The Decade of Data : We are living in a decade of data. Every company leverages insight from data for competitive advantage. Data movement, transformation, analysis, & observability software will underpin data applications used by every part of modern organizations. Machine Learning as a Force Multiplier : There are four types of machine learning: classification, prediction, interpretation, & generation. Modern software embeds these four types of ML into workflows which anticipate user needs & enable workers to operate at a superior level of abstraction. Decentralized Infrastructure as Database : Blockchain technologies invert data ownership by shifting control to the end user. This new architecture transforms the relationship amongst users, assets, & businesses. If you’re building in these spaces, or have a theory about the future of software, I’d love to hear from you .

Burn multiple measures the capital efficiency of a startup. Burn multiple calculated like this : net burn divided by net new ARR. Startup burn multiples have changed markedly in 2023. Companies with more efficient burn multiples between 1-2 plan to increase their net burn per new dollar of bookings by between 14-40%. In contrast, startups with higher operating expenses will reduce their burn multiple by 34-70%. The average startup with a burn multiple of 5 plans to reduce to 1.5. Companies with burn multiples of 3 will stand firm, operating their businesses at the same levels of efficiency. Curiously, there’s no correlation between burn multiple & expected growth rate in 2023. The majority of the surveyed population plans to operate with burn multiple of 1.5 or less. With the Series B & Series C capital markets barely open , the quantum of growth capital has plummeted nearly 80%. Startups’ plans have shifted aggressively to capital efficiency, without a noticeable impact on ARR growth. We’re all learning to achieve the same with less.

As generative AI captivates Startupland, startups will do what they have always done: integrate new technology to build transformative businesses. Incumbents have seized the moment with Microsoft, Adobe, & others integrating generative AI into their products quickest. In response, startups must develop moats to stake out their market. What are these moats? At the moment, capital & technical expertise create competitive advantage. Models require millions of dollars & technical expertise to deploy: document chunking, vectorization, prompt-tuning or plugins for better accuracy & breadth. But in the long-term, usage will be the enduring moat. Machine learning systems, like any complex program, benefit from more use. The more queries against an ML system, the more the strengths & weaknesses of a system come to light. Product & engineering ply those insights to improve performance. That process spins a flywheel. More queries -> more diagonostic data to improve the model -> a better product with more users. In addition, researchers have observed an emergent property of machine learning models : something we didn’t anticipate but we can see. Researchers at MIT call this phenonemon Reflection . In this experiment, machine learning agent learns from its mistakes using another machine learning model called a Reflection LLM. Reflection improves its accuracy from 75% to 97% after 12 tries. This technique worked well for one of the two attempts, but not both. It’s still early in this research area but the paper reinforces the idea that more usage will lead to significantly better model performance. My marketing professor in grad school wrote an equation on the board the first day of   class : Innovation = Innovation + Distribution. In generative AI, innovation & distribution are inextricably linked, feeding each other. More users means a better product. A better product will attract more users. That’s the moat.

Sales cycles shifted dramatically in 2023. Slower sales cycles create pipeline shocks & startups are feeling the impacts. The average startup saw a 24% increase in sales cycle from early 2022 to 2023. 60 day sales cycles are now 75 days. But the latency isn’t evenly distributed. Startups selling to enterprises have increased 36%, twice those of Mid-Market & SMB focused companies. This figure is statistically significant with a p value of 0.0005. The distribution chart above shows about one-third of enterprise sales cycles take 50% or longer than last year to complete. Mid-market & SMB distributions skew left with up to 10% of businesses reporting a decrease in sales cycle during the period. The VSB chart shows a bi-modal tilt to the data: most companies observe a moderate increase but about one-quarter have seen a doubling. Segment % increase in sales cycle Enterprise 36% Mid-Market 18% SMB 17% Very Small Business 26% Usage-based companies have suffered greater increases in sales cycle than seat based companies: 29% vs 21% with a p-value of 0.1. And yes, enterprise focused companies with usage based pricing models have borne the greatest overall increase of 44%. These benchmarks suggest startups should plan on materially longer sales cycles into 2023. The antidote: greater pipeline-to-quota coverage ratios by either increasing the top of the funnel or reducing the account executive headcount. The data analysis uses the results from the 2023 GTM Survey .

The hardest round to raise so far in 2023 is the Series B.  Although, all the early & mid-stage rounds have fallen to levels not seen for 5-10 years. Q1 volumes by year show broad declines across early-stage venture capital. Seeds peaked at 1500 in Q1 of 2020 falling to 155 in Q1 of 2023. Seeds fell 64%; As 68%; Bs 86% & Cs 80% of last year’s round counts. Examining the ratios of rounds, we can assess where capital is flowing. The ratio of As to seeds has held constant. So has Cs to Bs has increased, but Bs to As has dropped sharply. Median round sizes are relatively constant, still only down 10-15% from decade highs. The companies raising in Q1 possess enough leverage to demand those terms, a signal strength. Why is the Series B so rare? First, the market hasn’t yet determined the clearing prices for Series B companies. The new pricing norms, the multiples of ARR which declined from 100x ARR , aren’t broadly accepted. Fluctuations in the public market challenge investors to underwrite outcomes. Second, startups who raised Series As in the last 18 months raised the biggest Series As seen since 2000. Flush with cash, there’s no need to rush to the private markets to raise more capital, especially when valuations might be lower. Better to grow & wait for terms to improve. With more time & more comparable transactions clearing the market, we will establish norms. But for now, the mid-stage market is quiet.

“Our analysis indicates that approximately 19% of jobs have at least 50% of their tasks exposed to GPTs when considering both current model capabilities and anticipated GPT-powered software.” That’s the conclusion from OpenAI’s recent paper “ GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models. ” How much might US GDP grow assuming large-language models enable US workers to do more? The BEA estimates US GDP is $26.2t . If we assume the OpenAI study implies workers spend 50% less time on the tasks impacted by large-language models, the US should benefit from a 4% GDP improvement which is about $1.05t. MIT found engineers spend about 55% less time when using Github CoPilot. . Writers benefit similarly Taxed at the US corporate income tax rate of 21%, LLMs would produce about $220b in Federal government income or about 15% of the projected 2023 deficit of $1.4t . The Congressional Budget Office projects the US economy will to grow 3.1% this year so if this study is directionally correct, LLMs’ contribution would more than double the GDP growth rate. This surge could parallel the personal computer’s doubling of the US labor productivity rate from 2005-2015 when computers penetrated most business operations which correlates to Moore’s Law according to a research report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. None of these calculations take into account changes in staffing or personal income tax collection on gains in productivity or new jobs/industries that might grow or shrink. Second-order effects like these are challenging to accurately predict - like monarchs & monsoons . But given the pace of Microsoft, Salesforce, & Adobe launching LLM-enabled products, the speed with which these productivity gains accrue to GDP may be rapid. Within the paper, the authors reveal the professions in which 100% of the work will be impacted by LLMs : mathematicians, tax preparation, financial analysts, writers, & web designers. Insurance appraisers, financial managers, & search marketing strategists will see less than 15% of their work impacted by AI. What do you think? Will large-language models produce greater productivity gains than the personal computer?

In late 2021, Office Hours welcomed Claire Hughes-Johnson, former Stripe COO & VP at Google . During that session, she alluded to a book sharing her expertise in building exceptional teams at two of the most successful startups. That book, Scaling People : Tactics for Management & Company Building. is a book a management team could take to an offsite to develop or re-imagine the entire operating system of a business. The book starts with a company’s founding documents, expands to the operating cadence, and culminates in the business’ operating system. The founding documents include the mission which includes the founding story (the why), the long-term goals using McKinsey’s three horizons (the what), and the operating principles of the business (the how). Rather than calling them values, operational principles ties the company’s beliefs of how work should be done at the business in a more tangible way than values. Move with urgency and focus Our users entrust us with their money, their businesses, and their livelihoods. Millions of businesses around the world—individuals, startups, and large enterprises—are open for business only if we are. When we mess up, miss a deadline, or slow down, it matters. We take that responsibility seriously. The operating cadence describes how & how often the management team reviews progress & communicates with the team. The section on accountability mechanisms illustrates how meeting agendas coalesce : [E]ach Sunday night ahead of our standing Monday meeting, the Stripe leadership team shares snippets of key information from the past week, priorities for the upcoming week, and progress on action items. Much of the Monday meeting agenda is derived from those snippets. Another segment emphasizes the importance of Stripe’s written internal communication. To paraphrase from an internal document written by Eeke de Milliano : Writing is an equalizer; it provides everyone the same information. Writing leads to higher-quality thought because it forces attention to detail. Writing is efficient because it eliminates repeating oneself. The operating system consists of the workflows to achieve the goals according to the cadence: recruiting, performance management, & compensation. Claire interlaces the book with questions to identify a good recruiter & her favorite techniques for evaluating how well a candidate learns. Woven throughout the book are observations about management like :  Great managers say the thing you think you cannot say & leadership is disappointing people at a rate they can absorb each of which provoke reflection. Claire’s philosophy is about clarity. She provides lucid mental models to align teams to achieve great things.

I’m watching public company earnings to identify early trends in the software market to inform startups’ plans for 2023. Earlier, Mongo DB announced earnings. I’m adding Mongo to the list of tracked companies for this series. The economic slowdown which started one year ago has reduced growth rates by 31% across this group from 46% annually to 31% annually. Mongo expects the environment to challenge growth over the next few quarters. Mongo’s predominant database product is a transactional database records purchases in contrast to analytical databases which read data for reporting. Since Mongo charges by use, we can interpolate a declining number of purchases at Mongo customers. There’s more insight within the transcript highlights : Mongo Atlas is a hosted cloud database which shows significant growth still at 50% & has become the majority of the company’s revenue Atlas revenue grew 50% year-over-year, representing 65% of revenue and we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 40,800 customers. Plus, customers aren’t using their credits, which suggests longer-term usage declines. [T]he higher-than-typical unused commitments that benefited Q4 revenue are making for an incrementally harder sequential compare. But Atlas revenue will decline in Q1 - illustrating the speed & depth of cost cutting efforts within the Mongo customer base. Existing customers have reduced budgets & the company must acquire new customers at a fast enough clip to maintain revenue. First, we expect Atlas revenue to be flat to slightly down sequentially in Q1. In addition, Mongo’s other main product Enterprise Advanced which enables customers to manage their own Mongo instances, is shrinking. [W]e expect to see a meaningful sequential decline in EA revenue. NDR remains above 120% but has fallen across the board. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. Overall, this is a recipe for significantly less growth. Mongo generated $1.28b in fiscal 2023. At the high-end of the range of $1.51b for fiscal 2024, the company projects 17.6% growth - quite a drop from the 47% seen the previous year. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion.
Unused credits boosted this quarter’s revenue - another sign customers have cut usage significantly. In closing, an analyst asked whether particular verticals contributed to the growth rate decline. The answer: “No, it’s been broad-based.” Mongo’s earnings call underscores the new budget constraints across buyers & paints a stark contrast to the massive growth in the previous year. Software budgets aren’t yet showing signs of growing.

Within the span of a few days, Startupland has experience an extraordinary set of events. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank & 2 two others, then the intervention of the US Treasury to backstop deposits. During that time, founders & management teams responded with tremendous fortitude under pressure, developing contingency plans to assure the success of their businesses - yet again! It was an inspirational moment - and a challenging one. Take a breath. – As business as usual resumes, many companies are working through a task list similar to this one : Communicating the health of the business & the plan to employees. Meeting payroll obligations for March’s first & second payroll cycles by accessing the capital tied up in accounts. Establishing new banking relationships with several banking providers & re-evaluating cash-management policies to ensure adequate liquidity. Understanding the second order effects which will likely increase the costs of doing business Venture debt : In the last few quarters, many companies signed term sheet for venture debt lines as runway extension policies. Startups may need to negotiate new lines elsewhere. However, the venture debt market may shrink in size & rates may increase because Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Redundancy in payment processing : payroll providers & billing systems will establish relationships with multiple payment providers to eliminate the dependency risk on a single vendor possibly increasing fees. Sales cycles lengthen temporarily : during the last few days and for the next week, management teams have been scrambling to respond to a cash-liquidity crisis, which has stalled financial approvals of new projects & purchases. Other second-order effects will arise, but they are hard to predict. Teams will need to remain agile to respond to them.

With all the broad macro economic shifts, startups are pursuing their core markets much differently in 2023 than in 2022. To illuminate those trends, I’ve constructed a brief, 28 question go-to-market survey here. . My goal is to understand how startups have evolved their sales, marketing, customer success, and cash management from the go-go days of early 2022 to 2023. Then to publish the results & answer questions about them at an upcoming Office Hours. Have sales cycles lengthened or shortened? How have gross-margin adjusted paybacks changed? How has the burn multiple changed? With this data, we should be able to draw some broader conclusions about the shift from growth to efficiency & determine if the buyer behavior changes in the private market parallel those in the public market. If you complete the survey, I will share with you the anonymized raw data so you can perform your own analyses. If you have questions, just message me on Twitter or send me an email.

As machine learning becomes core to  every product, engineering teams will restructure. In the past, the core engineering team & the data science/machine learning teams worked separately. The core engineering team ships the product & focuses on reliability. For most companies, the data science team analyzed data & wrote machine learning models to support the business functions : sales, marketing, customer support. These teams operated downstream of the data warehouse. But they are movin’ on up to work on products in front of the data warehouse. ChatGPT has catalyzed an expectation in users’ minds that all products should converse with users & should be rather intelligent. To accomplish this vision, companies will merge the data science team into core engineering. Data scientists’ expertise will be required to optimize the end-user experience : determining the right data sets to use to train models, understanding the best prompts to elicit germane answers (prompt-engineering), & model monitoring. They will need to be part of core engineering to achieve those goals. The forces behind this change have been brewing for some time. Data science teams’ increased budget faces pressure from the office of the CFO to justify the investment. LLM-features should contribute directly to revenue via upsell & market share, quieting questions. Also, the challenges of pushing models into production have frustrated data science teams. In this new world, data scientists will commit directly to production code. Organizational change will require behavioral change. Machine-learning enablers - startups that sell ML toolkits - have shifted sales tactics to seize the day. Their ideal customer profile is no longer data science teams but core engineering teams. That fundamental shift - selling to the core engineering & data science teams - creates new opportunity for vendors to unify the two groups by providing platforms & infrastructure that enable a new form of collaboration.

Over the past week, I put ChatGPT to the test, enlisting it as copy-editor for a forthcoming blog post. Here was my process: I dictated a blog post outline into a Google document I prompted ChatGPT to revise the post for clarity & pasted the text I copied ChatGPT’s response, edited it some more & consulted ChatGPT for three rounds just like John McPhee So, does a robot copy-editor work in practice? ChatGPT builds sentences word-by-word, by starting with one word, then predicting the next one . The robot has ingested more than 500 GB of sentences   &   calculated the odds that the word after this one is…and then injects it into the sentence. The robot repeats this process until it completes the sentence or paragraph or tract. Every so often, the robot introduces some randomness in choosing the next word, to pepper its responses with variety. Without this butterfly-flapping-its wings chaos factor, the narrative spins & stalls, entwining the reader in tautological, repetitive loops. Like Grammarly, ChatGPT absolves the writer of grammatical labors. I found no errant commas, misspelt words, or grammatical faux pas in its output. Better than grammar checking, the robot reorganizes sentences, clips others,   &   trims the text’s length. Mark Twain would have loved this robot . What’s missing from the experience is a unique voice & creativity : ChatGPT doesn’t yet use words like loaded pistols . No rhetoric. No similes, alliteration, zeugmas, or pleonasms. No statistics to prove a point or ideas from thinkers on the topic without a prompt. But, ChatGPT proved a useful editor, structuring text, correcting grammar, & helping to hew a raw idea into a polished, final form. Without a doubt, generative AI robots will produce reams of pulp nonfiction synthesizing coherent re-combinations of sentences found elsewhere on the internet in a singular voice. The question for startups evaluating automated content production : whether this is enough to stand out in buyers’ minds. For many use cases, uniqueness won’t matter. Product documentation, evergreen content for SEO, canned responses for email. At least for now, the writer’s role to kindle a spark in the mind of a reader with rhetoric isn’t challenged because novel narration techniques haven’t yet been automated. Whether current generative techniques can get there remains to be seen.

In August, I wrote about why Omni’s technology reinvents BI once more . The Omni founding team hails from Looker & Stitch. They’ve set out to solve the problems customers faced with the previous generation of BI. Today, I can show you what this means in practice because Omni is commercially available. Anyone who has managed a larger BI deployment has faced the challenge of managing hundreds, perhaps thousands of metrics. As more users calculate figures, consistency across teams becomes a company-wide challenge. Marketing & sales define revenue or leads or cost-of-customer acquisition differently. In the BI tool, a marketing analyst finds three metrics:  cost_of_customer_acq, CAC2, & new_CAC. Which is the right one to use? Data brawls - disputes between teams about metrics definitions - break out. Omni solves these problems. In the video above, a data analyst writes SQL to understand the business’ customers’ buying behavior. Omni identifies the metrics calculated by the query & surfaces them in the toolbar. The analyst creates a new field, Total Sales Sum, with the UI then filters the output by country. Last, Omni visualizes the data. Omni enables an analyst to calculate a metric, promote it to a top-level field within a notebook, & then broadcast it to the entire organization - all without writing LookML or any other modeling language. Workflows exist for metrics management. The BI team and the CFO may decide they would like to approve this metric before the business declares it the gold-standard. This subtle workflow innovation cascades into deceptively large organizational change. Users define metrics at the edge of the organization: the marketing team, the sales team, the operations team. Teams refine metrics over time, then promote them to the entire organization after approval. Technical analysts can build models from code if they prefer crafting the data model from the bottom-up also. Both paths lead to beautiful & interactive visualizations that use modern technologies to render quickly. Omni picks up where the previous generation of BI left off : enabling organizations to define metrics, promote them to the company, then manage thousands of metrics while moving with the confidence of consistency across teams. Give it a try here .

The FTC reportedly will sue to stop Adobe from acquiring Figma . Similar questions have surrounded Microsoft’s acquisition of Blizzard;
The US Department of Justice seeks to unwind the
Google/DoubleClick merger ;
British regulatory bodies forced Facebook to reverse its Giphy acquisition . Visa abandoned plans to buy Plaid after facing a suit. We’re entering a period wherein governments regulate large technology businesses more actively. Startups evaluating M&A have additional factors to consider. I served on the boards of two companies that plodded through regulatory
review.  Looker & Kustomer each spent roughly a year waiting for approval. The period between a startup signing a merger agreement & the
transaction close (when money & stock changes hands) might last a few weeks for a small acquisition or drag for more than a year for higher-profile buys. The longer the period, the greater the challenges facing the business. First, the company’s emotional high of negotiating the deals is doused with the surprise of regulatory uncertainty. As processes drag on, employee attrition can spike. Second, unexpected legal bills measured in the millions arise. Depositions, document collection, strategy meetings flood executive calendars - not for one government but for the US, the EU, the UK, & Australia - all core markets for software businesses - each of which can block the merger. So can Austria - a pickled red herring [1]. Third, the business must navigate through the thick fog of uncertainty. Customer ask, is the startup standalone or part of a larger company? Tricky questions also cloud recruitment conversations : who is hiring the new employee? Who is granting options? At what strike price? What happens to vesting if the process drags, concludes, or falls through? Fourth, the longer the investigation, the greater the business fundamentals differ from the initial agreement. A rapidly-growing business may double its revenue during investigations & could command a material premium to the initial acquisition price (or the reverse!). Those are some of the higher-level concerns. When considering accepting an offer from an acquirer, an important question arises. How great is the regulatory risk of the transaction falling through? Some buyers face more scrutiny & risk of reversal. Break-up fees, relatively uncommon today, may become more prevalent in startup M&A as a result. Also, the universe of active buyers will shift meaningfully. The biggest technology companies may slow or pause their M&A programs because the odds of success in certain categories may mar their ability to consummate mergers. Less competition in auctions may drive multiples down. As regulators wield their power, the M&A landscape will shift. One thing is certain : there are more questions than answers & more risks for startups & boards to evaluate. [1] Heringsschmaus is a famous Viennese pickled-herring dish

In CloudFlare’s latest earnings report , the management team highlighted the strength of enterprise buyers within their customer base. I wondered if this were broadly true. Do public software companies with largely enterprise customer bases benefit from superior growth to their peers with mid-market or SMB focuses? Enterprise & Mid-Market public companies have seen a relatively constant decline in growth rates through the last six years. SMB businesses benefited from a post-Covid surge when the US re-opened - a phenomenon that seems to abate with time. Product-Led companies continue to outpace Sales-Led Companies in growth. However, PLG suffered a 9 percentage point drop in growth rate in Q2. Segmenting the population by growth rate yields the same conclusion. Low growth is < 15%, Medium growth is 15 - 30%, High growth is 30%+. The behavior across buyer sizes parallels each other. The data so far suggests the economic slowdown has struck across the industry similarly. Variations will surely emerge between competitors as a result of differences in product, execution, or strategy. But no one is immune. Something to consider for 2023 planning.

I’m watching public company earnings to identify early trends in the software market to inform startups’ plans for 2023. Yesterday, Cloudflare announced earnings. I’m adding Cloudflare to the list of tracked companies for this series. Company Q-6 CAGR Q-5 CAGR Q-4 CAGR Q-3 CAGR Q-2 CAGR Q-1 CAGR Q-0 CAGR Microsoft Azure 50% 51% 46% 46% 40% 35% 31% Google Cloud Platform 46% 54% 45% 51% 35% 38% 32% Amazon Web Services 37% 39% 40% 40% 33% 27% 20% CloudFlare n/a n/a 48% 49% 51% 48% 48% CloudFlare’s annual growth rates haven’t slowed in the 5 quarters, unlike Microsoft, Google, & Amazon’s growth rates. Net-dollar retention did dip below the 130% annual target because of customers’ changing buying patterns, a message consistent with other clouds: We still see a clear path to a dollar-based net retention over 130% as we ramp seat-based products like Zero Trust and storage-based products like R2, But, the earnings call suggests enterprise customers’ buying habits remain healthy. The enterprise segment outgrew the company’s average growth rate by 8 percentage points. Large customer revenue contribution increased again sequentially to 63% of revenue, up from 57% in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2022, large customers represented 61% of total revenue compared to 54% of total revenue in 2021 and 46% in 2020… Overall NDR fell, but enterprise spending remains steady. Our large customer net expansion was flat quarter-to-quarter All regions grew at the same rate last quarter implying no regional differences in buyer demand. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 44% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue and increased 42% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 40% year-over-year. Turning to our customer metrics in the fourth quarter. The surge in pipeline is notable given the uncertainty in the market but the close rates are low & sales cycles slow : another confirmatory data point for startups to plan cautiously in 2023. Despite a notable improvement in our pipeline exiting 2022 as compared to with the first half of the year, we have assumed the increase in sales cycle, which we observed in the second half of last year continues in 2023 and have, therefore, incorporated close rates below recent historical lows. Channel sales have become stronger. This is likely due to a move up-market where larger buyers seek professional services to deploy infrastructure. But it may also suggest that many resellers with large sales teams looking to sustain their transactional businesses are able to drive additional software bookings. The channel accounted for about 13% of revenue this quarter, which is the highest it’s ever been. Machine-learning companies are an important agent of growth & seem to be less loyal to a platform as they seek the most economical solution for their data storage & compute needs. [AI companies] have a real use case for the cloud which is somewhat different than what we see from some other companies. It is, I would say, more forward leaning and that is that they are constantly looking for … wherever the cheapest GPUs are to process their data. R2 has become the natural neutral place for these AI companies to store their training data in order to make sure it can be inexpensively and efficiently access from anywhere…But it’s a use case we didn’t anticipate. Today, our largest R2 customer is another AI company using us for exactly the purpose of being a neutral place to store their training data. Cloudflare’s earnings report suggests smaller companies may not suffer the broader headwinds of the market. The company’s security portfolio which should prove more resilient to fluctuations in spend factors in significantly to the results’ hardiness. As Google also reported, usage-based pricing models may weather downturns betterbecause the products they meter grow irrespective of headcount growth, a positive sign for infrastructure.

Amy Cortese published “Venture Capital, Withering & Dying” in the New York Times on Oct 21, 2001. I came across it during a Google search & reading through the article. It’s a powerful reminder of history’s rhymes. With some market indexes off 50 percent or more and with uncertainty growing after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, investors have become much more discriminating. So far this year, 29 venture-backed companies have tried initial offerings, compared with 252 in 2000. There are also fewer mergers and acquisitions. Venture capital funds lost 18.2 percent, on average, for the 12 months ended June 30, according to Venture Economics, while Internet-specific funds were down 27.7 percent. Most vulnerable are funds that were raised and invested at the height of the bubble, in 1999 and 2000, when 70 percent of all high-technology venture capital for the last two decades was invested. ‘‘There was so much activity and so much excess in the last two years it will take several years for the system to work through the excesses’’ All of these sentiments & observations apply directly to the current state of venture as they did 21 years ago. In Venture capital investment pace has slowed. The IPO & M&A markets remain quiet. Venture capitalists have written down portfolios. This is a natural part of the cycle. Despite the headlines - then & now - about how things may be ending or dying - it’s just a matter of time before the cycle begins anew.

During this recession, startups will fall into one of four categories which I wrote about in June . But, I missed something in this post : the advantages are compounding, which is the reason the biggest will continue to win share. It’s also the reason changing strategies can be expensive. This is the time in the startup cycle when big balance sheets become strategic advantages. First, companies with bigger balance sheets can sustain higher monthly burn rates, which fuels growth. Imagine the same company under three different net burn conditions: $0.5m, $1.0m, & $1.5m in monthly net burn [1]. In five years’ time, the $1.5m scenario triples the size of the $0.5m in monthly net burn. The elbow of compounding growth creates a minor separation to start, but a yawning gap within a handful of years. The same phenomenon plays out in the fundraising markets. The faster-growing company raises more capital to reinvest in growth [2]. The richer the balance sheet & the more solid the business model, the greater the growth rate & ability to win market share. Why does this reinforcing effect exist? Companies with greater presence in the market will build brand, hire more sales teams, pitch more prospects, close more customers. More revenue growth translates into more dollars raised. Note, I haven’t factored in the valuation multiple premia afforded to top quartile growth. This GTM flywheel accelerates & decelerates startups’ market share. Changing strategies means the compounding effect either increases (spending more to grow) or decreases (conserving cash). The right strategy depends on the startup’s position in the market & the relative strength or weakness of competition. There’s no single answer, but it’s important to consider the effect of compounding growth in determining a strategy. Over the next 24 months, we should expect significant market share changes to result because of the compounding effect. [1] Assumptions: $1m in starting ARR; $25k ACV with a $50k CAC; 30% of ARR + Net Burn invested in Sales & Marketing ; 120% NDR ; constant sales efficiency. % NDR ; constant sales efficiency. [2] Assumptions: sell 15% of the company at a value of 10x next year’s ending ARR annually.

I’m watching public company earnings to identify early weaknesses in the software market . Yesterday, Google & Amazon announced earnings which completes the picture. Growth will continue to slow this year. A year ago, AWS, GCP, & Azure averaged 44% annual growth. Today, that figure has dropped to 27%. Amazon also guided to lower growth rates in the future. Amazon: We expect [customer] optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. ﻿So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens. Google: [GCP] saw slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs. The collection of these three earnings calls presages continued reduction in growth rates, likely through the end of the year, as most businesses favor profits over growth - a trend echoing across Startupland. Google: [We] are pushing Google Cloud to Profitability. With an operating loss of $480m on 7.3b in revenue, GCP is at -7%, not far off breakeven, but a long way from AWS’ 30% profit margins. One surprising nuance from the Google call: Revenue growth in GCP was again greater than Google Cloud, reflecting strength in both infrastructure and platform services. Infrastructure spend is more resilient than application spend. This may be the result of layoffs: applications are sold by the seat. Less hiring growth means smaller expansion. Meanwhile, the servers keep chugging along & data compounds at a constant growth rate. Long-term the growth potential remains. Amazon: 90% to 95% of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And if you believe that, that equation is going to shift and flip, I don’t think on-premises will ever go away, but I really do believe in the next 10 to 15 years that most of it will be in the cloud" And despite slowing growth rates, 20% growth of an $85b revenue business is $17b of new spend annually. Amazon: Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Overall, given the trends we’re seeing, I expect cloud growth rates to fall into the 18-22% range for 2023, about half of the growth rate of a year ago.

In his most recent earnings conference call, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella said “Every product of Microsoft will have some of the same AI capabilities to completely transform the product.” Today, Microsoft Teams launched AI features in Teams for a fee . Teams will summarize meetings, create chapters in those meetings, extract tasks, translate in real time, & develop templates for future meetings. Incumbents have lept onto advances in generative machine learning more aggressively than any trend in recent technology history. Mobile, cloud, social - startups led each of those waves. But generative ML differs because incumbents are pushing the envelope. As startups incorporate generative machine learning into their products or develop new products, understanding the competitive dynamic with incumbents will be more important than before. Over the past decade, the most advanced machine learning systems have often been built inside the largest technology companies. For example: PyTorch & zero-shot machine translation across 100 languages at Meta, TensorFlow and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), built-for-purpose algorithm training silicon at Google.
Github Copilot at Microsoft. Tech giants have amassed the largest data sets, leveraged massive balance sheets to finance the human and financial capital-intensive work of training models - which can cost millions of dollars for each run - and amassed years of experience working with large data sets. In addition to these the advantages, these incumbents have another edge : their distribution. Microsoft Office’s customer base spans more than 1m companies & 350m paid users. Microsoft will upsell new ML features across their product suite at a premium - just like Premium Microsoft Teams. A full-frontal assault on the word processor, presentation-building software, chat, or spreadsheets must rely on more than just integrating generative machine learning. It will require a GTM innovation - a new way of acquiring customers to vie with the incumbents. Doubly so in the current environment where CFOs are actively reducing costs by consolidating spend with fewer vendors given the economic climate. The most successful startups leveraging generative models will innovate both in the application of the technology & also in its distribution : finding new applications, new customer segments, novel sales & marketing strategies - out of the focus & acumen of the incumbent giants.

100 years ago, fluorescent lamps & suspended ceilings topped the list of hottest trends in office design. In 1928, San Antonio’s Milam Building claimed the honor of the first office skyscraper with air conditioning. Twenty-five years later, window-encased skyscrapers with internal glass walls distinguished the modern office. Employees ensconced in the Lever House & the Seagram Building in New York enjoyed more daylight at work than any other Manhattanite. Another generation would pass before the open office plan bulldozed walls separating managers & employees. Robert Probst conceived & George Nelson designed the Action Office - the iconic aluminum, wooden veneer, & black plastic desks of the 1980s. Within a decade, the Action Office evolved into the cubicle, wrapping white-collars in a warren of workspaces. Before the millennium’s end, 40 million cubes dotted the American urban landscape. In the late 90s, startups in Silicon Valley eschewed the grown-up Legos for more frugal & more dynamic tables. Each of these major shifts occurred because of some underlying societal or management philosophy change. Frederick Taylor , the original productivity-maxi, discovered employees’ productivity surged in better conditions, leading to air conditions. White-collar, a term coined by Upton Sinclair, delivered initially as an insult, required employers to raise the stature of paper-pushers, luring them with increasingly beautiful workspaces - the skyscrapers of the 1920s. Startups’ desire for speed sounded the death knell for the cubicle. No walls meant the kinetic energy of new ideas translated immediately into Brownian-motion implementation: a sales person could yell two rows over to a product manager, relaying a customer’s request for an item on the roadmap. Cubed is a history of the office & how employers evolved to attract, retain, & encourage employees. It’s a riveting little book that weaves societal & political backdrop into the evolution of the workspace & provokes questions about what the office will become in the next decade with WFH rationalization atop every employers’ mind.

I’m watching public company earnings to identify early weaknesses in the software market . Yesterday, Microsoft announced earnings. The transcript highlights the major trends in software of 2023. Below, I’ve listed those trends with data & excerpts from the earnings call transcript. 1. Enterprises Have Slowed their Spending, Decelerating Further in December: Company Q-6 CAGR Q-5 CAGR Q-4 CAGR Q-3 CAGR Q-2 CAGR Q-1 CAGR Q-0 CAGR Guidance Microsoft Azure 50% 51% 46% 46% 40% 35% 31% 26% Google Cloud Platform 46% 54% 45% 51% 35% 38% Amazon Web Services 37% 39% 40% 40% 33% 27% Growth is down 15 percentage points or about a third in a year. We are seeing customers exercise caution in this environment, and we saw results weaken thru December. We saw moderated consumption growth in Azure and lower-than-expected growth [elsewhere]. It’s mostly a US phenomenon so far: We saw strong execution in many regions around the world, however performance in the US was weaker than expected. Expected growth across segments is muted with an average of 5% growth across these B2B categories. Segment Expected Growth Productivity 12% Office Commercial 6% Office On-Premise -25% LinkedIn 5% Dynamics 13% Intelligent Cloud 18% Azure 26% Server -3% Services -3% 2. Spending Won’t Ramp Again Until Optimization Stops in about a Year Customers are optimizing their cloud spend in 2023. At some point, the optimizations will end. In fact, the money that they save in any optimization of any workload is what they’ll plow into workloads. And those workloads will start ramping up. I don’t think we’re going to take two years to optimize. But we’re going to take this year to optimize and then, as we optimize, the new project start. The new project starts don’t start instantly at the peak usage. 3. Machine Learning is a Secular Platform Change & a Growth Driver for Software The age of AI is upon us, and Microsoft is powering it. Just last week, we made Azure OpenAI Service broadly available, and already over 200 customers – from KPMG to Al Jazeera – are using it. We will soon add support for ChatGPT, enabling customers to use it in their own applications for the first time. Azure ML revenue alone has increased more than 100 percent for five quarters in a row 4. Microsoft’s Ability to Cross-Sell its Suite is Driving Dominance in Many Categories GitHub is now home to 100 million developers. Atlassian has 10m active users compared to 90m actives at Github . Power Automate has more than 45,000 customers – from AT&T to Rabobank – up over 50 percent year-over-year. UIPath, the leader in RPA reported 10,650 customers in October 2022 . Teams surpassed 280 million monthly active users this quarter… And we continue to take share across every category, from collaboration, to chat, to meetings, to calling. About 70% of commercial Office subscribers use Teams. Over the past 12 months, our security business surpassed $20 billion in revenue, as we help customers protect their digital estate across clouds and endpoint platforms. This is about 12% of the global information security market according to Gartner. Massive software vendors are indexes of buyer behavior. Yesterday’s call reinforces the cost-focused mindset of the buyer & the lower growth rates startups should expect. Machine learning shines as the one bright spot amidst declining growth.

The current wave of layoffs, a difficult component of the innovation boom/bust cycle, differs from the previous years’ dynamics. B2B companies have reduced headcount to a greater extent than at any time since 2020. In the last three years, B2C startups’ ratio of layoffs have dwarfed B2B layoffs. In 2020, B2C companies cut 8.8x the number of B2B employees. 3.8x in 2021, & 6.9x in 2022. Year-to-date in 2023, the figure is 1.6x, just 60% more. Reduction magnitudes don’t differ by buyer type. B2B & B2C companies both downsize around 15% on average, with a 75th percentile of 30%. Tangentially, Covid impacted both segments. The average layoff cut 50% or more of staff & more than a quarter of these businesses folded. But this is a statistical aberration from a tiny number of companies. Instead, the gross number of companies explains the delta between B2B/B2C layoffs. But this isn’t an endemic phenomenon. Data Point B2B B2C Companies Raised Capital 21,256 17,109 Total Raised, $b 275 229 Raised per Company, $m 77 75 About 4k fewer B2C companies than B2B companies raised roughly equivalent capital since 2020, which means B2C companies may suffer from higher volatility in general: more exploratory business models, more risk to their core businesses when market conditions change. Longer-term contracts & steadier enterprise buyers help smooth shocks for B2B companies. The main challenges facing B2B startups today are decreases in seat counts as their customers downsize & slower sales cycles which creates volatility in bookings , which has caused more layoffs than an anytime in the last four years.

Most massive software companies structure themselves with an office of the CEO, which allocates capital to different business units. Within each business unit, a general manager operates one or more products. There are three paths I’ve seen to achieve this scale: The dominant path of the last ten years: focus on a single product until the company is roughly at $100m in ARR, then build adjacent products. Snowflake, DataDog, Zendesk, CrowdStrike etc. Build a financial holding company acquiring lots of small businesses & use the profits to acquire more businesses. Constellation Software. Develop multiple products from Day One. This is called a suite strategy: Zoho published a history of the 2-4 product launches per year, which illustrates the idea . In a recent podcast, Parker Conrad champions the suite strategy, also called a compound company. Parker founded Rippling , a six-year old company with about 1800 employees. Rippling sells about 13 products for information technology teams, finance teams, & human resources teams like mobile device management, payroll, & talent management. A compound company must excel at new product development & launch. At Rippling, new products must leverage the 4 strengths of a compound company: Compound companies develop shared infrastructure across products to move faster & enable integration. Superior reporting arises from a shared data model on a vital customer data asset (customers & employee data are two examples). Prospects buy software for a report: the better the insight, the more valuable the software. Common design language across products simplifies on-boarding. A customer learns the software once & then can work with new products without much of a learning curve. Bundling of software justifies discounting, reducing the blended cost of customer acquisition & improving net-dollar retention which creates very large ACVs in the mid-market, not just the enterprise. When the office of the CEO approves budget for a new product, the company hires a general manager for the product. The GM hires the first 4-5 people on their own - without Rippling’s talent team. This test reveals the GM’s ability to sell others on the team’s mission & prospects. Then the team of 10 people or so launches the product into the customer channel, rapidly iterating until the product has achieved its goals. Why might it be the right time to start a compound company? In the first two decades of cloud, Parker argues startups built superior point solutions to compete against the distribution might of on-prem incumbents. Cost-cutting CFOs prefer consolidating spend on suites. Suite strategies trade depth for breadth at least in the short term & require a different mentality for building a company. Today, new startups have to compete with a cloud-native incumbency. These different competitive dynamics raise the question : is the better approach is point solution or suite?

“The Startup M&A Market Fell 94% Year over Year - But One Segment Thrives” , a post from last week, elicited the same question from many readers. Just who are the most active acquirers for smaller takeouts? To answer the question. I reviewed the roughly 560 US software acquisitions under $400m since January 1, 2020. ServiceNow tops the list with 5 acquisitions. Alphabet ingested 4 companies. So did Medallia. Most of the other top 25 buyers, including Splunk, Apple, & VMWare, closed the period with 3 M&A events, about one annually. Examining the data by dollars reveals Motorola spent $800m, more than double the average across this group. Alphabet bought $400m of startups & Apple $375m. Recruiter.com prefers small acquisitions: 4 purchases during the period, totalling less than $12m in value. How does willingness to pay vary by acquirer? CrowdStrike, Alphabet, & Motorola have paid about $3m per employee, roughly twice the median. Percentile M&A Value per Employee, $m 25th 0.7 50th 1.4 75th 2.2 The rule of thumb has hovered at $1m per person in the past. Perhaps inflation seeped into this market just as much as groceries & gas. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, the M&A market has persisted at roughly constant pace. 453 distinct acquirers each spent $50m annually on smaller acquisitions over the last three years, providing on $10-20b of liquidity to founders, employees, & investors each year. Year Number of Acquisitions Average Value, $m 2020 155 77 2021 280 83 2022 124 78 The acquihire / small value part of the acquisition market remains an essential component of Startupland’s model. Small acquisitions provide liquidity, help incumbents staff new initiatives, & continue the forward progress for the ecosystem.

I’d like to have a hero image atop each blog post. Readers dwell for a few seconds longer on blog posts with images. Plus, images garner more interest across social media. I wondered how the current wave of generative AI image makers like Midjourney, Dall-E, & Stable Diffusion would fare creating images for a few of my posts. Here are the results. The format is blog post, the prompt issued to the algorithm, & some commentary. What the $6B Coupa Acquisition Means for Software Startups . Prompt: Coupa & Thoma Bravo logos each in front of a cloud with a plus sign between them. The system struggles with logos. Thoma Bravo didn’t register. Coupa vs Coppa (ham?) and maybe some Cyrillic in the bottom left leaves the reader wondering if I’m starting a Russian deli. Sizing the Web3 Software Market Prompt: a collection of crypto tokens on a cosmic background. It’s close but most of the tokens aren’t real (could be a statement on the ethereal nature of   crypto). The tokens crowd each other. 5 Predictions for 2023 Prompt: a Magic8 Ball with the year 2023 on the internal pyramid. Not really an eight ball. Not really a year. These initial images suggest the models aren’t trained on business data - which isn’t a surprise. Rather, they have been fed art. When prompted with “hare rabbit on an Ikea fire truck,” the result is striking - a chef’s kiss. It would be hard to entrust a B2B content marketing program to these systems. But it’s a matter of time before a startup blossoms to take advantage of this opportunity & trains a domain specific model. As startups blossom to capture these markets, they will improve model accuracy. One day soon, I expect every post on this blog to have a synthetic hero image.

Frank Bien at Looker kicked off each year with a theme. A decade later, I still remember them. These themes focused the company & the board. The management team wove that theme through every board deck during the year. I imagine the internal messaging prioritized it, too. One year, he dubbed the Year of the Hound. Looker had focused on technical data teams as its ideal customer profile for the early years. As the business grew, the Looker team expanded that focus to non-technical users (hounds) - the business analysts consuming, sharing, & commenting on dashboards. Another year, Frank rallied the company around Looker 500. Looker began to sell successfully to Fortune 500/Global 2000 companies who required new features & scaling other ones: e.g., managing a user base measured in thousands. 2023 is a pivotal year for many startups. Churchill once said, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” Startups’ advantage is speed of execution through focus. The macroeconomic backdrop provides an opportunity to reset, refocus, & reprioritize on a core theme. With Sales Kick Off imminent for many startups, it’s time to fill in the blank. 2023 is the year of _______ .

The US startup M&A market in Q4 2022 was one of the quietest in the last 20 years. It rivals the dotcom bust & Global Financial Crisis for its paucity. In percentage terms, last quarter dropped the most since 2000, falling 94% year-over-year. US venture-backed M&A fell from $34.6b in Q4 2021 to a paltry $2.1b in Q4 2022. The total quantity of acquisitions demonstrated greater resilience shrinking by 56%, while the median acquisition value tumbled from $81m to $22m (-72%). A $22m median M&A price implies most of these transactions were acquihires - acquisitions that value a company for its team. There are 3 types of acquisitions : team ; team & technology ; team, technology & revenue. During a down-market, young startups who face a radically more challenging fundraising market than six months ago more often choose a quick sale. M&A secures the team greater financial certainty within a more established & better capitalized business. On the buy side, acquirers delay bigger transactions, preferring to accelerate early stage product development with tuck-in acquisitions of small teams. Larger, higher-revenue-multiple combinations face more scrutiny from corporate boards when stock prices fall & equity becomes dearer. This change in the exit market parallels a surge in acquihires in 2014 when corporate development departments began to acquire seed-stage companies for talent rather than waiting for Series A businesses. Cash-flush internet giants Google, Amazon, Facebook, & Apple benefitted from a strong macro-environment to staff critical teams in new disciplines. During the 2013-2014, median acquisition prices increased by 50% in less than a year, from $36m to $54m. Despite the activity, we are unlikely to see a similar increase in valuations until competition increases further or the public technology markets begin to demonstrate strength. It’s no surprise Q4 2022 acquisition value plummeted. But it doesn’t mean all sectors of the M&A market are silent.

Just how big is the current web3 B2B SaaS total addressable market (TAM)? In the last six months, 103 web3 companies generated revenue on-chain, the smallest of which recorded a few hundred dollars of sales & the largest, Ethereum, tallied $401m. 44% of these companies produced less than $0.5m. But a nascent mid-market does exist : 41 companies produced between $5-25m. Figure Value Total Revenue, $M 771 % of Revenue spent on Software 30% Implied Web3 Software TAM, $M 231 Implied Web3 Software TAM (excluding Ethereum), $M 75 The average software company operates at about 70% gross margin, so let’s assume a web3 company is similar. To simplify, we’ll assume the typical web3 company spends all of that cost of goods sold (COGS) on software -  about 30% of revenue [1]. That implies the web3 B2B software TAM is roughly $231m in 2022 & $75m excluding Ethereum, which comprises roughly 60% of the revenue. Web3 software sales must also navigate novel procurement processes with decentralized decision-making, payment for services in kind with tokens, & different permissions models for users. At a 10x revenue multiple, web3 software should support about $0.75b to $2.3b in startup market cap. Depending on your view on web3 revenue growth, a 10x multiple might be high or low. The limited number of potential customers challenges web3 vendors. With fewer than 100 accounts willing to spend $20-50k on a software contract, every interaction is precious, especially those larger accounts which dominate revenue. To contrast with web2, Salesforce counts 150k customers in a market of about 650k who spend $57b annually. This is just the web2 CRM market. While possible to build a business selling exclusively to web3 companies, the bigger market today is selling web3 technologies to web2 companies. Solutions in gaming, marketing, & financial services where decentralized databases or virtual wallets solve a core business need. This is a rough estimate. Most software companies also include customer success in COGS. Fully allocating all COGS to software is aggressive. On the other hand, the software purchased by Sales & Marketing and Research & Development teams isn’t included in that line item. So, this should be a reasonable guess.

Sometime in the winter of 2020, I read Dan Luu’s article on latency . “I’ve had this nagging feeling that the computers I use today feel slower than the computers I used as a kid.” So he measured different computers using a high-speed camera & he found a modern Macbook had about 3x the latency of an Apple 2e, a computer from 1983. Dan wrote a subsequent post on terminal latency : the fastest application on your computer is likely the terminal or the command prompt. Those posts inspired me to learn how to use the terminal : mutt for email, neovim for taking notes, ripgrep for searching a computer; sed for text replacement; there are thousands - maybe tens of thousands. Two years later, here’s what I’ve learned : First, it’s true. The terminal leaves the browser gasping for breath. Terminal latency tops out in the tens of milliseconds compared to the typical web page, which dawdles for 10 seconds to load the average web page - 100x slower. The computer waits for me, not the other way around. Second, many of the UI affordances of modern apps trace their lineage to the command line. Create a file with neovim, write the name of another file, type the letters gf with your cursor over the file & you’ll be transported to it, just like that. No need for a fancy notetaking app. Third, I work faster now because I can do many things from a single screen. When I take notes during pitch meetings, I trigger actions with function keys (never used those before!). F2 opens the startup’s website in a browser. F3 searches LinkedIn for the founder. F4 pastes a questions template. F5 shows me the list of employees who subscribe to this blog. Fourth, I can chain things together. I can save a to-do while writing an email without leaving my email. I pull up notes from a pitch meeting, create a new entry in a CRM, or do any of the things above while replying to a founder, without having to create a new tab or switch applications. Instead, all those seconds saved I’ve spent soldiering up daunting learning curves & text-based manual pages - a trade I’ve been willing to make but an unappealing adventure for most. Apple’s visual operating system & the dawn of Netscape transmogrified the command line from a wall of text into a canvas so billions of people could use a computer without having to learn syntax. Even if visual UIs take a bit more time load, for most people, the experience is worth the wait.

Constellation Software is a $30b+ publicly-traded software holding company employing more than 25,000. A former venture capitalist, Mark Leonard started Constellation in 1995 with  $15m of  outside investment & a goal of buying vertical software companies with a moat & good unit economics. Vertical software companies pursue a particular market segment like car dealership management or hotel management software. From 2003 to 2014, Constellation’s revenues compounded from $80m to more than $5b, an average of 25% annually. In 2014, Constellation grew revenues 40%, which today would place the company in the top quartile. But Constellation arrives at that growth in a very different way : they acquire to grow. Leonard’s letters reveal a different mentality to building a software behemoth. Growth Source Value Acquisition 33% New Bookings 10% Price Increases 5% Contraction -3% Customer Churn -5% Net Growth 40% Acquisitions increased revenue 33%. New bookings added 10% ; price increases 5%. Contraction & churn reduced growth by 8%. The net : 40% growth rate. Constellation acquires tens of businesses each year. These acquisitions tend to be small (around $5m) & the company operates most businesses with a team of 30-40 people across 5 operating segments by theme. BU Size # of BUs % > 200 6 3% 100-200 29 15% < 100 158 82% The Constellation model differs from the venture-backed software companies. But at scale, software holding companies can grow at similar rates & trade at similar multiples to their venture-backed peers. In one of Leonard’s letters, he mentions that his management team reviews a business they admire in detail to understand it each quarter. In that vein, I’m highlighting a different path to the same end goal : creating a generational software business.

Every year I make a list of predictions & score last year’s predictions . Here are my predictions for 2023. ML propels SaaS into a massive second wave that increases workers’ productivity measurably. Machine learning models predict code, synthesize images, author blog posts reducing composition time by a factor of 2 or 3. Users grow accustomed to this very quickly & ML becomes a requisite feature in most workflow SaaS. The hangover from web3’s raucous 2022 extends into 2023. Most categories slow down meaningfully, including Defi. More than 100 web3-enabled games launch. Virtual wallets ensconce themselves into web2 applications. Marketing becomes the first broad use case of web3 after Defi, catalyzed by the death of the third-party cookie. The Fed tames inflation. We exit 2023 with inflation below 2.5% but a Fed Funds rate of 5%. Forward software multiples touch 7.0x forward, up from 5.8x today, on the relatively strong growth rates of most public software. Private equity acquires 10% of the 70+ publicly traded software companies by the end of the year. With hundreds of billions of dry powder, plenty of healthy cash flows generated by SaaS publics, & the leverage of the inevitable shareholder lawsuit if a board rebuffs the 30% premium of a tender offer, private equity becomes the dominant M&A option in dollar terms for 2023. The fundraising market thaws, but at materially lower prices than the first half of 2022. The early stage market prices seeds at $10-15m post & Series As at $50-60m post (with about $500k in ARR). The mid-stage market for Bs, Cs, & Ds rebounds but chaos reigns. Some businesses will raise at sensational multiples (as if the market hadn’t changed) ; others will leverage their balance sheets to skip-the-dip & await multiple expansion before raising equity dollars ; yet others will reprice both common & preferred in flat or down rounds. Flat & down rounds surge to 30% of all mid-stage rounds completed in 2023, up from less than 5% in the first half of 2022. In short, 2023 will be the first year of a new-normal era. The go-go days of 2021 & the pandemonium of 2022 ebb, leaving a year of sobriety at low tide: longer diligence processes, fewer rounds, lower entry & exit valuations. Scoring last year’s predictions: Web3 consumer products go fully mainstream with more than 35% of Americans, about 100m people, engaging with them by 2023. Not even close on this one. There are more than 100m web3 accounts on centralized crypto exchanges but the scandals that plagued web3 this year stifled consumer interest in web3. Data companies continue to achieve astronomical growth. Accurate. Data companies in the public markets continue to trade at premium multiples & record the fastest growth rates. In the private markets, data & machine learning companies continue to raise capital despite the macro-slowdown. GPT-3 and BERT infuse software massively reducing repetitive work and unlocking huge productivity gains. Perhaps the trend of the year, generative machine learning models like ChatGPT, Dall-E & others have invigorated software founders & incumbents alike - both of which are re-imaging SaaS with ML as an essential product component. The ML stack folds into the classic data stack. Zero. I believe this will happen the battle between cloud data warehouses & data lakes intensifies, so I’ll hold out hope despite the lack of any material advance in 2022. The spirit of Silicon Valley continues a spread outward. Correct. Covid accelerated distributed work, which is now a norm. Startup company formation & funding thrives outside the Bay Area. 3 of 5 isn’t terrible. I would have thought the web3 prediction would have come closer to reaching fruition, increasing my score. But 2022 was unpredictable in many ways. War, inflation, Messi’s first World Cup. The year of sobriety before us provides a potent substrate for startup formation. Boom cycles begin this way. Tougher markets demand better product-market fit from startups leveraging the new technology of the era. This foundation leads to more halcyon days when the promise of technology is realized & the market rewards both customers & founders.

A funny thing happened along the way to Sand Hill Road in the last decade : startups stopped talking about how much runway a Series A would buy them. In the 2000s, when capital was scarcer, founders & VCs would derive round size by debating the quantum of money required to achieve Series B milestones. When capital is scarce, it’s rationed. In the 2010s, US venture capital grew 40x in 10 years. More capital meant the constraints of yester-decade no longer applied. Founders declared a maximum acceptable dilution instead. Round sizes ballooned. So, did headcount at the Series A. In 11 years, the median headcount at Series A swelled from 15 to 28. [1] As the pendulum swings to a higher-cost-of-capital-environment, milestone-based financing may return. Let me explain : Era Median Employees at A Median Salary Median Round Runway in Months 2010 15 150k 3.2 17 2021 28 200k 16.1 35 2021 28 200k 7.8 17 In 2010, the median software Series A startup raised $3.2m & employed 15 people at about $150k average cost. Series A dollars provided the business 17 months’ of runway at constant burn assuming no revenue. In 2021, employment costs per capital increased to roughly $200k. At 28 employees, a $16m Series A fueled the company for 35 months. That’s a lot of buffer to achieve Series B metrics [1]. But we’re no longer in 2021. Today, the public markets value companies like it’s 2017 . If the Series A market follows suit, the median series A will fall to $7.8m, which means a 28 person company will have 17 months’ of runway - effectively identical to 2010 runway. Capital scarcity curtails startup operation. Team sizes will winnow to lengthen runway. Fewer person hours means less marketing, sales pitches, & bookings. Founders & VCs would debate how much capital is required to attain Series B milestones at higher salaries than a decade ago. I doubt the pendulum will reach the touch the capital scarcity of 2010, if only because VCs have more than $200b in dry powder. But, I wouldn’t be surprised if milestone-based financings re-emerge to justify round sizes again. [1] Thank you to the Pitchbook team for running the headcount analysis data.
[2] Tangentially, this is why the burn multiple (total burned / total ARR) has become an important investor metric.

These ten were my favorite books of 2022. I was seeking parallels or theories to frame a mental model which explains why economics & history dominated the list. The Man from the Future . My favorite biography of the year, The Man from the Future begins in Budapest, the center of the financial & intellectual world circa 1900 profiling John von Neumann . von Neumann is the consummate polymath. He started his career by pushing pure mathematics forward with key papers, then moved into physics working on the Manhattan Project , developed the von Neumann computer architecture (most modern computers are still built this way), then developed game theory & wrote the seminal work on the topic. Bond King : Bill Gross, the Bond King, started a multi-trillion dollar asset management business with innovation. Working as a coupon-collector at an insurance company, Gross began to trade those coupons, previously illiquid instruments & pushed Pimco to preeminence. The Future of Money : A history of currency from barter to paper specie, this book pushes into the world of digital government currency called Central Bank Digital Coins & provides a multi-thousand-year perspective on currency that hint at web3’s potential impact on money. Amp It Up : Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, imbues this book with the focused intensity that has propelled his companies to the zeniths of their respective industries. Statistics & Data Analysis for Financial Engineering : Luna, 3Arrows & FTX’s implosions dominated the web3 market this year. All were failures of risk management. This book uses R code to illustrate how to manage & calculate risk with techniques like multivariate statistical models, copulas (which define how various assets correlate - important in a bear market when most assets become highly correlated) & Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for scenario analysis using state machines. A technical but worthwhile read. The Man who Solved the Market : A history of the most successful quantitative trading shop in history, The Man who Solved the Market details the life of Jim Simons & the turbulent creation of Renaissance Technologies. RenTech hoarded trading data to leverage as a competitive advantage & has produced returns north of 50%+ for many year. That’s after a 4% annual management fee & 44% share of the profits. Silverview : Spy novels spice up my predominantly non-fiction diet. John Le Carre is a favorite of mine. So is Mick Herron & his Slow Horses series. Silverview is Le Carre’s last novel published posthumously & a novel whose suspense builds throughout, cresting to a satisfying crescendo. Physics for Future Presidents : If you became President tomorrow, you would need a deep enough understanding of science to ask trenchant questions about energy policy, climate change, space, & dirty bombs. After 384 pages, you’ll know enough to be commander-in-chief. The Lessons of History A husband & wife, both career historians, who have published many books & won the Pulitzer, collaborate for one hundred pages to summarize everything they’ve learned about humanity. A colossal undertaking & success. The Changing World Order : Ray Dalio’s book on the evolution of the financial markets draws on ideas from the Fourth Turning to explain the difficult economic future facing the United States in the next decade, and the sunny future after GDP levels rise enough to offset the inflation caused by the money printing machine of the last decade.

This morning, Coupa announced its sale to Thoma Bravo for $6.2b . The acquisition is notable for three reasons. First, the premium to the public price is 31%. Second, the multiple is 8.4x NTM revenues. Both of these data points imply public multiples have room to grow. Third, it’s the most substantive acquisition to announce this year after Figma’s announced its sale to Adobe . The M&A market may be thawing a bit. Metric LTM Value Average Software Public Value Revenue, $m 787 n/a Revenue growth 22% 31% Gross margin 60% 72% Net income margin -44% -19% Cash flow margin 22% 10% Comparing it to other public SaaS companies, Coupa grows revenue 9 percentage points more slowly, operates with lesser gross margin of about 12 percentage points, generates twice the loss as a fraction of revenue, but produces twice the cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue. The cash flow appeals to private equity because those dollars pay off interest for the leveraged buyout’s debt. Also, strong cash flows indicate a healthy underlying business despite slower-than-average growth & less-than-average profits. Segment Forward Multiple Growth Rate Coupa 8.4x 22% Avg. SaaS 6.0x 31% As Michael Mauboussin writes in Expectations Investing , there’s information in price. Coupa’s 8.4x forward multiple, the premium paid to sell the business, is the output of a bidding battle between Vista Equity & Thoma Bravo. That data point means at 8.4x forward multiple for a company growing 22%, there’s still enough upside to justify a 3x return to a private buyer with active management. Were the average public SaaS company to trade at the same growth-adjusted multiple as Coupa, the typical multiple would be 11.8x, nearly doubling from today’s marks. (This simple math ignores other financial aspects of a business : profitability, cash flow, etc.) Coupa’s sale continues a trend of private equity buying venture backed startups , a result of record PE fundraising & depressed multiples. Startups should expect more private equity M&A both in the public & private markets. Over time, the M&A market activity should begin to inform public valuations. If private buyers are willing to pay premiums above the public market, then overall market multiples should rise.

Profitability or net income margin has become the most important correlate to public software company valuations. But public companies are less profitable today than a year ago. Surprisingly, PLG companies’ profitability has suffered more than sales-led businesses. Across every quartile, public software & infrastructure companies have seen a 5 percentage point drop in net income since Covid. Product-led growth (PLG) companies - those who educate & convert buyers with product rather than sales & marketing (SLG) - operate at about 5% to 10% less profitability than sales-led motions. Curiously, this profitability pattern changed during the pandemic. Before, PLG companies operated at better profitability. Since then, PLG companies operate with 10% worse profitability (p-value < 0.001). What happened? PLG companies spend comparable amounts on sales & marketing (S&M) to SLG companies, but they spend more on research & development (R&D). The chart above shows the combined Sales & Marketing + Research & Development Costs divided by revenue. PLG companies spend 9 percentage points of revenue more on S&M + R&D than sales driven companies (p value < 0.001 since Covid). That explains nearly all of the delta in profitability. Post-Covid Metrics GTM Motion S&M Spend / Revenue R&D Spend / Revenue Total Spend / Revenue PLG 40% 35% 75% SLG 41% 26% 67% PLG companies R&D spend hasn’t produced new business at the same rate as a dollar invested in sales & marketing post-Covid. Some observations about the data: PLG companies R&D spend hasn’t produced new business at the same rate as a dollar invested in sales & marketing post-Covid. PLG motions tend to focus on smaller businesses which may be more susceptible to the economic downturn. Sales-lead teams cut headcount when account executives don’t attain numbers. Engineering teams do this to a lesser extent. Software sales cycles have lengthened, which SLG companies can mitigate with better sales skills. These longer cycles may reduce the conversion rates of non-sales-assisted PLG motions. Some portion of R&D spend should be allocated to customer acquisition cost for all software companies. This should bring PLG sales efficiency closer to SLG figures . Management teams ought to be evaluating whether a PLG or SLG investment produces more bookings per dollar invested. The analysis should include customer expansion for several years. As net income may become a more important metric for valuation, it may replace sales efficiency as a better metric for measuring bookings productivity.

These are the top 10 posts by engagement for 2022 at tomtunguz.com. Reflecting on them, I see they clustered on web3 & the fundraising market, both of which experienced a tumultuous year. Selling in the pandemic & post-pandemic also drew a lot of interest. I’m grateful to everyone who read them, commented, debated, & shared them. The Web 3 Marketing Stack: The Next Big Wave in Crypto . I wrote about my thesis that web3 technologies will underpin both a fundamental change in web2 ads by replacing the cookie with an NFT & the tools web3 startups will need to pay for growth during the current winter. The State of Web3 in 2022 through Data . Delivered at DuneCon, this presentation provides an aerial view of the state of web3. About 2.5m active users, about 5k developers committing code, & 70-90% drops in activity from the beginning of the year. Figma’s 50x ARR Multiple & What it Means for Startup Fundraising . Adobe’s acquisition of Figma at the highest ARR multiple ever for a company-at-scale stunned the market that was reeling from the macroeconomic shock. Deliberately Underselling as Sales Strategy Borne from a series of Office Hours with Lee Kirkpatrick & Bill Binch, this post advocates for quicker sales cycles with smaller ACVs to drive more predictability & superior NDR. Also, this strategy minimizes pipeline supply shocks. Growth is No Longer the Best Predictor of a Software Company’s Value . After a twelve-year long bull run, investors no longer value growth at-any-cost. Efficiency matters just a bit more in the public markets. A watershed change that cascaded into the private markets that has led to a significant bid/ask spread between founders & investors. 9 Predictions for Data in 2023 Delivered at Monte Carlo ’s IMPACT summit, I touched on the evolution of the decade of data. More than half of analytics workloads reside in the cloud in ten years. Grey Skies in Cloud Earnings I charted the earnings reports of the three largest cloud infrastructure companies as an index of software buying behavior. Growth rates for these behemoths have fallen in half from 44% on average to 22% in two quarters, underscoring the lengthening sales cycles of enterprise software. Fundraising 2022  Where We Are & Where We’re Going From Traction in Vancouver, these slides demonstrated the bid/ask spread between VCs & founders. Investors saw the public markets fall 70% & surveyed founders replied they expected a 10% decline in valuations. Where those two meet will determine the environment for 2023. Imagine You’re a Venture Capitalist . This posts questions how to manage a venture fund: whether to double down on companies during a changing valuation environment. $112m of Market Cap per Engineer . I calculated the total value creation in web3 & divided by the active number of developers to estimate this statistic. The figure has fallen by 80% or so since I wrote it. Regardless, I still believe in the potential of web3 technologies.

Data visualization is a passion of mine. I remember reading Edward Tufte’s book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information & stumbling across Charles Minard’s “ Napoleon’s March .” Most visualizations plot 2 dimensions. Napoleon’s March encodes 6 : the geography of the terrain, the route & the direction of the army, the headcount of the troops, the temperature of the battlefield, & the time of year of Napoleon’s doomed quest to conquer Russia. Click to enlarge it. It’s a hyperdimensional work of art. When Looker founder Lloyd Tabb showed me his new project Malloy I thought immediately back to Napoleon’s March. Malloy makes hyperdimensional data analysis straightforward. It’s a new type of semantic layer. An example helps explain Malloy’s advances. This is automobile recall data in the US using Malloy . There are 7 dimensions shown here: the car maker, the historical recall total, the percent of recalls, recalls by year, recalls by type, the most recent recalls, & the biggest recalls by number of cars. Within each cell, you’ll find different analyses. The by_type table subgroups by recall type. Meanwhile, the by_year_time_chart is a time series of recalls over the last 50 years. You can click on any data point to drill into it. That’s what hyperdimensional means. Showing data by different axes: time, type, manufacturer, & establishing relationships across them. Minard must have toiled for weeks to mosaic his magnum opus. Data analysts today could coalesce a dashboard similar to the one above but it would still take hours or days. The auto recall visualization above requires 38 lines of Malloy code which encode the layout, the graphics, & the aggregations. Malloy abstracts away the complexity. We’re in the Decade of Data. The Modern Data Stack has created many powerful abstractions to enable more insightful data analysis. The semantic layer is an important component of that progress. That’s where Malloy fits in. Had Napoleon lived today his famous quote about readers might have read: “Show me a family of [data analysts], and I will show you the people who move the world.”

Airdrops may be one of the most prevalent forms of marketing in web3. Airdrops reward users who have helped the project & generate awareness of the token by depositing free tokens into their wallets. Recently, Dune Analytics published an analysis of the Uniswap UNI token airdrop . Some background on the UNI airdrop: To be eligible, users must have transacted on Uniswap before September 1, 2020. Uniswap distributed 150m UNI tokens - about half went to insiders (investors, employees, etc.). Uniswap gave 400 tokens to each eligible user, worth about $1200 at the time. Today, UNI tokens’ market cap tops $5b. Dune’s analysis reveals that airdrops reach many people but may not drive long-term behavior: About 220k people were eligible for the airdrop. 6.7% of the original airdropped wallets still hold UNI today which raises the question of whether airdrops retain their users. 0.6% of airdropped users have increased their UNI ownership over time. 30,000 users haven’t claimed their airdrop for 400 UNI tokens each. Those 12m tokens are worth about $65m & cannot be recouped. There’s much more in the analysis that’s worth reading. Marketers bet loss-leader campaigns like airdrops generate more revenue than the cost of the campaign. Used “dollar airdrops” PayPal deposited $10 into each new user’s account when registering in their first growth phase. Since data is public on the blockchain, we can estimate the effectiveness of this airdrop. Field Value Campaign Cost $351m Cumulative Trading Fees $1205m Value of Trading Fees from Airdrop Users $208m Sales Efficiency 0.17 Payback Period 4.2 years With about 88m tokens distributed at a price of roughly $4, the campaign cost $351m. Airdropped users generated about 17% of cumulative trading fees since the September 2020 airdrop or $208m in about 2 years. Segment Payback Period in Years Multiple Private Software Startups 1.4 1.0 Public Software Companies 1.6 1.2 Uni Airdrop Annualized 11.8 8.4 Uni Airdrop Cumulative 5.9 4.2 That implies about 5.9 years payback on marketing dollars invested. The typical private startup has a 1.4 year payback on ad spend & the average public company is at 1.6 years. In 2021, I estimated that airdrops were 4-7x as expensive as spending venture dollars on sales & marketing. This second analysis shows that Uniswap’s token launch falls within those bounds. Both of these analyses reaffirm airdrops - as structured today - remain an inefficient marketing channel for web3 startups. Where might airdrops go from here? Look for an upcoming post on the topic.

What was the most successful launch of web3 in 2022? I think it’s a project that deserves more visibility than it has received. Reddit’s Collectible Avatars launched in August 2022. Collectible Avatars allow users to buy profile pictures. They can sell these to other users if they like. Blockchain powers the experience. The avatar trading subreddit has an active dialog of current collections . The marketplace supports artists. Creators pay Reddit 5% for minting costs, but retain the remainder of the earnings, less payment fees from Stripe or Apple or Google. Plus, creators receive 5% royalties on every subsequent trade. Why is this the most successful web3 launch this year? 3.2m Reddit users have a Collectible Avatar . That’s 10x more than the number of Axie Infinity users , the game which captivated the web3 world this summer & twice the number of OpenSea users The creator ecosystem is vibrant. 49 unique creators have drawn avatars. On average, a creator earned $189k gross revenue from the sale of their work. In all, users have spent $11.4m on supporting creators. The product blends web2 & web3 user experience. When you login to Reddit, you select the settings for updating your avatar, & you’ll find the collectible marketplace. There you choose an avatar - a free one or a paid one. At that moment, the point of maximum intent , you create a blockchain wallet to store your new avatar. Users manage the web3 assets inside a web2 product so it feels familiar. The experience retains its crypto-nativeness. It’s possible to migrate your Reddit wallet to Metamask or other classic wallets. The biggest challenge facing web3 today is how to bring new users & new dollars into the ecosystem. User & developer counts are relatively flat . Experiences like Collectible Avatars bridge the gap between the web2 & web3 worlds in a way that’s native to the product & community - which attracts  millions of new consumers to web3 & millions of new dollars.

I set out to determine if fundraising seasonality had changed from this post I published in 2014 which suggested Q2 & Q4 were best for founders. The answer is yes. The US software Series A market has become much less seasonal since that post in 2014. I’ve plotted the data above & smoothed it to clarify the patterns. In 2013, the surge in June/July & December stand out. Set that aside. Look at the Series A deal count curve for 2022, starting around 85 deals in January, surging to more than 90 in March, then collapsing to 50 by October and less beyond that. Some rounds may not have announced yet, depressing the figures. Regardless, the curve highlights just how different this fundraising market is from previous 11. To ask the question of which quarter is best misses the broader point : the bid / ask spread between founders & VCs remains wide which has quieted & nearly silenced the market.

After more than 14 years at Redpoint, I’m starting a new chapter. I’m filled with optimism for the future. The US venture capital ecosystem has grown 40x in dollars from $8b to $320b invested in 10 years . Fueled by this capital, startup company formation rates touched fifteen-year highs in 2021. The Decade of Data is just a few years in & already it has transformed the way we do business. Builders are re-architecting SaaS applications atop data warehouses to join data across domains in a wave that will transform software. Machine learning has become table stakes for modern software companies - users expect apps to anticipate their needs & businesses rely on it for competitive advantage. Web3 is just beginning to blossom, creating new distribution channels that will power another wave of innovation. Many of the greatest companies have been founded during difficult market conditions. This era will be no exception. I’m deeply grateful to the Redpoint team. I remember joining in 2008, a green product manager out of Google who had just landed his dream job. The Redpoint founders & partners shared their expertise generously & taught me the craft. Redpoint is a great firm - one that cultivates partners from associates & principals, which is rare. Thank you to everyone at Redpoint for your partnership. I’ll remain on my Redpoint boards & will support those management teams as before. I’ll share more on my plans soon. In the meantime, I’ll continue to be a student of startups, writing this blog, hosting Office Hours , investing, & partnering with founders.

My laptop is faster than your cloud. For the last ten years, the data ecosystem has focused on big data - the bigger the data set, the more exciting. But most workloads aren’t massive. Instead of requiring a scale-out database in the sky, most analyses are faster with an optimized database on your computer that can leverage the cloud when needed. This is why I’m thrilled to announce our partnership with MotherDuck. Motherduck raised a $12.5M Seed led by Redpoint and a $35M Series A led by a16z. Some of the brightest minds in data founded MotherDuck including BigQuery founding engineer Jordan Tigani & a broader team from Snowflake, Databricks, AWS, Meta, Elastic & Firebolt, among others. MotherDuck commercializes DuckDB, an open-source project co-founded by Dr. Hannes Mühleisen & Dr. Mark Raasveldt . Interest in DuckDB has grown geometrically over the past few years because of what it can do with data. Why is this technology so beloved? First, it’s easy to use. You can start working with Duck by adding a line of code to your data notebook - no permissions or credit card or account creation required. Second, DuckDB is fast. Compared to querying PostGres, DuckDB is 80x faster & benchmarks against other systems show similarly impressive results . Third, DuckDB can be embedded in software. Hex embeds Duck into their notebooks . Snowflake uses DuckDB to build data apps with Streamlit. MotherDuck’s architecture enables it to start with small data sets & grow with users’ needs as their data volumes grow - scaling up with workloads rather than scaling out, shedding the complexity & cost of distributed computation. Because of these advantages, MotherDuck is the best place for startups to build their first Modern Data Stack. MotherDuck integrates with data transformation layers, data exploration products & BI tools - starting small & growing with the company’s needs.

Let’s compare the organizational design of two hypothetical startups. Each has 4 layers in the company: CEO, VP/Director, Manager & Individual Contributor (IC). This first company has 112 employees across those four levels. 27 in management & 85 doers. Each manager has four reports. This is called the span of control . Layer 1 is the CEO, 2 are the VPs, etc. The second company - again with 4 levels - has 466 employees with 66 in management & 400 doers. These visualizations illustrate the idea that better managers enable more efficient organizations. Companies who ignore span of control grow soft in the middle. More personnel expense in management with less output which is a lose/lose proposition. A man walks down the street,
He says, Why am I soft in the middle now ?
Why am I soft in the middle?
The rest of my life is so hard! Increasing span of control from 3 to 8 means 88% of the employee population are individual contributors doing work rather than 69% - an increase of 28%. Span of Control % ICs of Total Employee Population 2 57% 3 69% 4 75% 5 80% 6 83% 7 86% 8 88% Temporary decreases in span of control tend to occur in high growth companies when managers hire teams in short order. But looking at span of control over time sheds light on team structure. As the market encourages startups to push for greater efficiency, management teams may want to examine the shape of their org structure.

During one of the toughest years for technology in more than a decade, the web3/crypto segment is suffering the worst. Inevitably, this crash will evoke disillusionment in the technology & the space. Earlier this week, FTX, a top crypto exchange became insolvent . Recently valued at $24b, FTX is the third major crypto company to collapse in 2022 due to insolvency: Three Arrows Capital & Terra complete the trio. In these three cases, each used cryptocurrency as collateral. When the collateral’s value disintegrated, the business defaulted. FTX’s trading arm, Alameda, borrowed against FTX’s token called FTT. Terra used their currency Luna to maintain a peg for their stablecoin UST. Three Arrows borrowed against their crypto holdings to invest in Luna & defaulted on their loans when Luna crashed in value. In addition, hackers have stolen more than $2.3b of assets from projects year-to-date. The rotten cherry atop this mud pie: across the top 100 crypto projects, the typical token has lost 75% of its value since January. Those are rough stats. But broad rejection of web3’s progress is as myopic as unmitigated zealotry for its innovations. Carlota Perez’s Technological Revolutions & Financial Capital lends some perspective on this crypto winter. Both Ben Thompson & Jerry Neumann have great overviews of the book. In short, technology advances progress through an installation phase when frenzy for an innovation drives speculative investment, with periods punctuated by rapture & collapse. Then the deployment period takes place when more sustainable businesses take root. Web3 remains in the installation phase when a technology exists & the promise of many new businesses outshines the reality. These cycles take 50 years & we’re about a decade into web3. The aftershocks of these three foundation-shaking earthquakes in crypto will include regulatory oversight, weaker investor interest, & broader skepticism which are healthy. Protecting consumer dollars with regulation reinforces credibility in financial institutions. Fewer dollars in the ecosystem will focus builders on viable business models. Investors will value these companies based on revenues. We’ve been here before. “ All of the money poured into tech companies in the first half decade of the Internet Era created an infrastructure and economic foundation that would allow the internet to mature.” The dotcom bubble created several multi-trillion dollar companies twenty years later. That gloom will continue to cast over the ecosystem until a founding team figures out a way to assemble decentralized databases, tokenomics, wallets, & NFTs into a product that changes the world.

8% annual inflation for a startup means losing a month of runway every year. Purchasing power erosion of this scale may entice founders with significant cash positions to explore riskier ways of generating yield. In the mid-2000s, many startups invested their excess cash reserves in instruments called Auction Rate Securities . ARS produced a steady stream of interest payments, like savings accounts, with a higher return. In February 2008, the ARS market seized . Startups seeking to sell their ARSs to fund burn were out of luck : no one would buy them. Runways shortened dramatically due to the market’s illiquidity. The Global Financial Crisis followed. Lehman declared bankruptcy. VC investment fell 40%, nearly halving another source of oxygen. Eventually, the SEC investigated the four investment banks, who sold ARSs & compelled them to repurchase these securities at face value. Because of the massive fundraising waves of the last few years, many companies find themselves with significant cash balances pondering whether to chase yield to stave off inflation. Investing millions at higher returns might offset the cost of a few employees or lengthen the lifespan of a company by a month or two or three. While those benefits may be attractive, especially in an environment where inflation may erode runway, investment liquidity remains the critical consideration. The point of raising venture capital is to have money when the company needs it. When ratifying a treasury management plan, it’s wise to keep at least 12-24 months’ of runway on hand just in case.

During Office Hours with Lee Kirkpatrick , Lee recalled managing a startup through a downturn. The business cut R&D spend to conserve cash. By prioritizing sales & marketing, the company successfully lengthened runway to increase revenue, which eased the subsequent fundraising. I wondered if a similar pattern existed in the public software markets. Actually, the opposite is true: software companies spend more on R&D (research & development) & less on Sales & Marketing (S&M) as a percent of revenue today than six years ago. I suspect it’s because of PLG motions. R&D as a percent of revenue across all public software companies increased from 24% to 28% in the last six years. The trend is consistent & apparent across all quartiles. I categorized these companies by their primary motion: sales or product-led. Sales-led companies have oscillated around the 25% mark. However, PLG companies are a different story. Starting in 2017 when the data is richer, the PLG companies increased R&D spend from 27.5% to 33%. Sales & marketing costs as a percent of revenue are down across both PLG & Sales-led companies. The sales efficiencies of the second-half of Covid are apparent especially in sales-led businesses. It’s curious that sales efficiency has been declining at the same time as S&M spend as a percentage of revenue has fallen. Perhaps it implies declining growth rates across the industry, but it’s worthy of closer inspection. The last three quarters show a trend reversal to increased spending, however. There’s no doubt from this data PLG companies spend more on R&D to grow. Carilu Dietrich & I chatted about this during her office hours . Atlassian followed this model to great success inspiring an increasing number of software companies to follow suit. Because of their larger balance sheets & ability to raise capital in the public markets, public software companies spent more on R&D rather than less.

In 2017, SaaS companies reported their cost of customer acquisition had increased by 65% in the previous five year period . What happened to these figures during Covid? We can examine the sales efficiency of public software companies to get a sense. Since 2016, the average public software witnessed its sales efficiency winnowed from 52% to 47%, a decline of about 10%. Covid, marked in the orange rectangle, didn’t impact sales efficiency initially. Remarkably, halfway through lockdowns, software companies found their stride, improving their efficiency by three percentage points. After a two-quarter spike, however, the figure has returned to its previous negative slope. This chart segments the public software companies into the 25th, 50th & 75th percentiles. I observe a few trends. First, the top & median quartiles benefitted from near five-year highs in sales efficiency during the back half of Covid. The lowest quartile companies didn’t. Second, every quartile now plumbs five year lows. Third, those lows touch the highs of the next rung down; i.e., the current levels of the 75th percentile companies’ sales efficiency is equal to the 50th percentile companies in 2016. What happened? Here’s my hypothesis. More competition increases costs of customer acquisition. That won’t change until software companies exploit a new sales channel. It’s unclear what that could be. Past channels have included web-based software, open-source, mobile app stores & product-led growth. During the first half of Covid, sales & marketing teams iterated to improve sales efficiency. Hiring stopped. Buyers paused their purchasing until a new equilibrium had been established, perhaps concurrent with viable vaccines. With newfound confidence on both sides of the virtual sales table, transactions occurred. Teams hired & spent aggressively, given the capital markets insatiable appetite for growth. Today, the macroeconomic uncertainty & the Fed’s interest rate policy to slow the US economy have lengthened sales processes across larger & likely overstaffed sales teams. The resulting pipeline shocks tanked efficiency. Companies that can buck this trend will be valued at significant premiums to the market - hence the sudden venture capitalist interest in product-led growth motions & Adobe’s acquisition of Figma at 50x ARR . Others who may see declining sales efficiency should trade at lower multiples than before. Sales efficiency correlates to multiples at 55% . Combined with a market whose cost of capital has surged with the Fed Funds rate, these trends will demand teams innovate to  create more efficient customer acquisition channels.

I’m watching public company earnings to identify early weaknesses in the software market . This week Microsoft, Google/ Alphabet, & Amazon reported their third quarter figures. Company Q-5 CAGR Q-4 CAGR Q-3 CAGR Q-2 CAGR Q-1 CAGR Q0 CAGR Microsoft Azure 50% 51% 46% 46% 40% 35% Google Cloud Platform 46% 54% 45% 51% 35% 38% Amazon Web Services 37% 39% 40% 40% 33% 27% The meaningful decline in growth rates started four quarters ago is hard to ignore. Let’s put these figures into context. Infrastructure revenue growth averaged 33% this quarter, which is astounding considering we’re talking about businesses that sum to more than $50b of revenue per quarter. Customers spent $12b more this quarter. At a 7x multiple of revenue, that is another $84b of market cap creation, in theory. But, the change in slope is meaningful, too. A year ago, these business units grew at 44% annually. The current recession is evident in the charts: growth rates have declined by 25% in six months’ time. The kink downwards in the red line at Q-2 shows a sudden deceleration in AWS’ growth rate. GCP is more volatile, likely driven by the volatility of bigger deals closing on a smaller revenue base. Meanwhile, Azure has declined in a more steady cadence. The data suggests a broader slowdown in software spending as these companies are indices of software buyers’ behavior . Public software multiples - 4.9x as of last week , not far from the decade low of 3.3x - should depress further given these results & forward guidance. Microsoft stock is down 10%; Amazon fell about 20%; Google about 12%. Lopping another 15% off multiples implies the median software company should trade at 4.2x forward revenues, a far cry from the 15x we observed not twelve months ago.

Yesterday, at the Monte Carlo Impact Summit I shared my 9 Predictions for Data in 2023. Here are the slides & I’ve embedded them below. The video is here. These are my 9 predictions. A year from now, I’ll score them to see how I did. Cloud data warehouses (CDW) will process 75% of workloads by 2024. In the last five years, CDWs have grown from 20% of the workloads to 50%, with on-prem databases constituting the remainder. Meanwhile, the industry has grown from $36b to $80b during that time. Data workloads will segment by use case into three groups. First, in-memory databases like DuckDB will grow to dominate local analysis even for massive files. CDWs will retain classic BI & exploration uses. Cloud data lakehouses will serve jobs operating on massive data & jobs that don’t require the fastest latency - and do it at half the storage price. Metrics layers will unify the data stack. Today, there are two different forks in data. The first fork uses ETL to pump data into a CDW, then to a BI or data exploration tool. The second fork, the machine learning stack, is identical save for the outputs: model serving & model training. The metric layer will become the single place metrics & features are defined, unifying the stack & potentially moving model serving & training into the database. Large language machine learning models will change the role of data engineers. I recorded a video of myself writing code to produce charts & embedded it in the presentation. The video shows Github Copilot magically creating a chart for the DuckDB star growth. Copilot ingests a comment, writes the code, even adds my custom theme function. When I execute the code, it works. Technologies like this will push data engineering work to a higher plane of abstraction. WebAssembly or WASM will become an essential part of end-user facing data apps. WASM is a technology that accelerates browser software. Pages load faster, data processing is speedier & users are happier. Every major browser supports WASM & consequently, anyone producing a data app for an end user will use it. Notebooks will win 20% of Excel users. Of the 1b global Excel users, 20% will become prosumers, writing Python/SQL to analyze data. They will do it in notebooks like Jupyter, which are easily shared, reproducible & version controlled. Those notebooks will become data apps used by end users inside companies, replacing brittle Excel & Google Sheets . SaaS applications will use the CDW as a backend for both reading & writing . Today, sales, marketing, & finance data exist in disparate systems. ETL systems use APIs to push that data into the CDW for analysis. In the future, software products will build their apps on top of the CDW to take advantage of centralized security, faster procurement processes, & adjacent data. These systems will also write back to the CDW. Data Observability becomes a Must Have. Software engineers measure the success of their efforts through up-time. 99.9% or three-nines of up-time means only 1 incident per 1000 hours. Today’s data teams see 70 incidents per 1000 tables. Data teams will align on data uptime/accuracy metrics & drive to the three-nines equivalent, using data observability tools to measure their performance. The Decade of Data Continues. Data startups raised more than $60b in total in 2021 more than 20% of all venture dollars raised. We’re still in the early innings of this foundational movement. Thank you to the Monte Carlo team for the opportunity & the audience for the great questions at the end.

Last week, David Heinemeier Hansson explained why his company, Basecamp, is leaving the cloud. They will manage their own servers to reduce the $3m annual AWS bill by 60% . Setting aside the technical questions around such a migration for a paragraph or two, this move will improve Basecamp’s efficiency materially. For a hypothetical startup, a 60% reduction in infrastructure costs boosts sales efficiency by 11% & net income margin by at least 12% . That means reducing the payback period from 21 to 18 months. These simple calculations ignore the additional margin improvements arising from depreciating the servers which should add a few more percentage points to the bottom line. Basecamp’s 60% reduction in cloud COGS isn’t anomalous. A recent survey showed the typical company would halve its costs by managing its own servers. We are in an era where profitability (net income margin) & sales efficiency constitute two of the top three correlates to valuation . Reverting back to self-managed infrastructure might hold some appeal for companies focused on financial optimization rather than growth. I wouldn’t be surprised if private equity held software companies adopt this practice to generate extra income in the next few years to offset some of this era’s greater interest expenses on debt. That optimization comes at some cost: hiring a team to migrate the software & to manage the infrastructure. In addition, the cloud offers burst-ability, the potential to serve a significant surge in traffic. Downtime implies a loss of revenue, which isn’t factored into the math above. For many high-growth startups, the juicy 11% improvement in sales efficiency likely isn’t worth the squeeze. Inspecting & controlling cloud costs may be the more appealing path. But for slower growth businesses or those looking to optimize their efficiency, moving to self-hosted infrastructure may be worth considering.

Yesterday, Office Hours hosted Carilu Dietrich, marketer at Atlassian & advisor to many iconic product-led growth companies (PLG). She’s seen many different types of businesses from startups to massive publicly traded software companies. Her unique vantage point on the tension facing the companies pursuing both PLG & classic selling formed the basis of most of our conversation. Here are some notes from the session. Carilu shared her Five Pillars of PLG Success. They are: An amazing product that wows within minutes. A user who wants to educate themselves. This education means using the product, solving a problem, & producing some output that’s useful to others. A buyer who becomes the internal champion to the rest of the team initially & potentially more of the company through time. A corporate culture focused on experimentation & learning through iteration & data. Philosophy of solving problems through product & software rather than through people or money. Atlassian spent 35% of revenue on R&D, the highest of its peers, & 15% on sales & marketing, the lowest of its peers. That’s pillar #5 in action. Second, many PLG companies move into selling larger contracts to grow & scale their businesses. This is a natural evolution: Atlassian, DataDog, Slack & many others have matured this way. To manage this, GTM teams segment the user base by customer size, dividing the world into PLG & AE selling motion by contract value. However, cross-selling remains squarely in the salespersons’ domain. Product-led cross-selling wasn’t effective at Atlassian. Third, the decision to complement an existing GTM strategy with product or sales-driven selling is a C-level/board-level decision because PLG isn’t just a product initiative or a marketing campaign. It’s a company-wide effort - often a multi-year journey. When Atlassian pushed into the cloud, the company split the cloud group into its own division, freeing the team to move independently & faster. Some companies are exploring splitting their organizations in two, divided by GTM strategy. But there’s no consistent pattern yet. We’re still figuring this out as an ecosystem. For a counterpoint on this idea, read about Kenny van Zant’s Flywheel Model , which Asana used to become a multi-billion dollar public company. There’s much more to the session. The full video is here . The podcast episode is found here. And the slides . Thank you, Carilu, for your insights & perspectives!

“Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.” A friend recommended rereading Nassim Taleb’s Antifragile given the macroeconomic backdrop, which I did this weekend. How does a software company become stronger throughout this volatility? One way is to ensure a healthy customer base. Cyclical companies boom when the economy thrives, but suffer during recessions. They are the hare of Aesop’s footrace. Non-cyclicals are the tortoises advancing inch-by-inch. In the last 12 months, tortoises have outpaced hares. The blue lines show non-cyclical sector performance & the red lines are cyclical sectors. I’ve watched some founders shift their sales focus to non-cyclical buyers for this reason. Churn, slower sales processes, & pipeline supply shocks are more likely today from cyclical customers than in the past. Startups become stronger through downturns, those who improve with stress, evolve to dominate. Darwinism at its finest. Adaptations in go-to-market strategy like this are important strategic questions to ask & answer.

The public software market continues to compress. Enterprise-value-to-forward-revenue multiples are now below 2016 levels for the first time in 6 in years. The 25th percentile of companies trade at 3.3x today compared to 4.0x in 2016. The median or 50th percentile trade at 4.9x vs 5.6x. The 75th percentile have resisted the downward pull & retain their premium: 7.3x vs 5.8x. The Federal Reserve Bank raising rates has been a strong depressor of valuations. The rates on the 10 year bond correlate at -0.49 R^2, meaning yield changes explain about half of the forward multiple’s movement since 2019. With the Fed seems intent on raising rates further, how low could forward multiples fall? A basic linear regression using this data produces this table 10 Year Rate Implied Forward Revenue Multiple 4.00% 5.1x 4.25% 4.4x 4.50% 3.6x 4.75% 2.8x 5.00% 2.1x The linear model is quite sensitive to the increase in rates. It doesn’t consider any other factors & it’s R^2 is only about 0.5. But it does illustrate the impact of rates on software valuations. Would it be crazy to see 3.3x forward? Not really. It happened in Feburary 2016.

On October 18th at 10am Pacific, Office Hours will host Carilu Dietrich . Carilu headed corporate marketing for Atlassian from $150m to $450m in revenue & through their massively successful IPO. Since then, she’s advised Segment, Kong, Miro, Bill.com & 1Password, among many others. Needless to say, her vista across many leading SaaS companies marketing practices is exceptional. During the Office Hours, we’ll discuss: the role of marketing in PLG motions. debate the two different ways of trimming marketing spend : better to cut people or programs? how to develop excellent positioning for a business. When to rebrand a company? If you’re interested to attend, please register here . As always, we will collect questions from participants before the event, weave them into the conversation, and answer live questions at the end of the session. I look forward to welcoming Carilu to Office Hours!

There’s a prevailing narrative that the health of the Bay Area startup ecosystem faces challenges. San Francisco’s share of startup rounds by count has fallen from its perch ten years ago. But that’s not the full story. In 2021, San Francisco Bay Area startups raised $126b. In 2019, US startups raised $126.4b. In the span of two years, a region’s startups raised as much capital as all of the US. During this same period, the US venture industry grew 41x from $8.8b to $360b invested per year. It is true that across all stages, SF’s share of venture rounds has fallen 15%. In Series Seed, A, & B rounds, the deficit measures 30%. One might conclude other geographies have siphoned San Francisco’s dollars. In dollar terms, San Francisco’s stake of the early US venture market eked 5% lower than 10 years ago. But, 2022 saw a swing upwards, reversing a three-year decline. Bay Area startups claimed of 55% total dollars up from 45% in 2012. The challenge with looking at relative share is we see only one leg of the elephant. While SF based companies’ round share may have declined, the aggregate dollars infused into the Bay Area ecosystem grew from $1.4b per year to $30b-$36b per year. More financings occur outside San Francisco, but Bay Area companies now raise 2000 to 2500 rounds per year, up from 404. Plus, SF startups raise 26x more capital to grow than a decade ago. To paint one geography’s success as a loss for another manifests a false causality. It’s not that VC dollars have left San Francisco to fuel other geographies. Rather, the massively exothermic venture market has expanded within & beyond San Francisco. Despite the correction in VC this year, $284b of new venture dollars will bolster American startup balance sheets - the second largest year ever, eclipsed only by 2021. That’s something we can all toast to : the health of Startupland broadly.

2020 is the decade of data. Look no further than the massive companies pushing the public & the private market forward: Snowflake, Databricks, Amazon, Azure, Google Cloud. It’s quite possible that data products have created more market cap than any other subsegment of SaaS in the last five years. On October 25th, I’ll share my 10 predictions for data in 2023 at The Impact Data Summit . Cloud databases generated $39b in spend , about half of all database revenue. That’s a remarkable feat for products who might be just blowing out ten candles on a birthday cake. Around & atop those databases, an ecosystem has developed that transmogrify data from raw ore to into a finished product consumed by analysts & operators or highly refined fuel injected into machine learning systems. During my session, I’ll answer the question: where might we be in another ten years’ time? Many of the instigators of this decade’s most salient wave in software will also be on the virtual stage: Ali Ghodsi : founder & CEO of Databricks George Fraser : founder & CEO of Fivetran Tristan Handy : founder & CEO of DBT Jay Kreps : founder & CEO of Confluent Lloyd Tabb : co-founder of Looker Barr Moses: co-founder & CEO of Monte Carlo Data Come for the practitioners, stay for the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman & quant blog mastermind Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight. Register here for the Impact Summit .

Imagine a startup with 4 customers in the pipeline. The average sales cycle is 28 days. Two of those customers should close this quarter. Two of them, who entered the funnel later in the month, will take longer than 30 days to close. If the ACV of the company is $25k, then the business should project $50k in bookings this period & $50k next period (assuming no additional pipeline materializes). Suppose sales cycles double in length from 28 days to 56 days. The customer progression chart might look like this. Customer 1 won’t close this period. Nor will customer 2. So, bookings in the current month zero out.  Bookings in the second month should be $25k. Scenario Bookings in Period 1 Bookings in Period 2 Total 28 day sales cycle 50k 50k 100k 56 day sales cycle 25k 25k 50k That’s quite a shock to the system from a seemingly small change in sales cycle. 28 more days in the sales cycle halves the bookings in the current period. Volatility in sales projections erodes confidence within the company. Given the economic conditions, many startups should expect slower sales cycles which introduces volatility into bookings. An executive team looking at a 50% quota attainment may wonder about the health of the sales team, product-market fit, competition, or other fears; even though the bookings challenges might be solely the result of procurement teams adding in a few additional steps in their process. Healthier pipeline-to-quota ratios are the antidote to this volatility. More customer prospects stifle volatility by ensuring the period’s number doesn’t rely on a single or small collection of accounts. In the next few quarters, I would expect many bookings charts to show a dip in one or two quarters. Companies who can juice the pipeline-to-quota ratio from the thinner 3x that’s become standard during boom times to 5-7x coverage should enjoy more predictable bookings.

At the inaugural DuneCon , Dune ’s first conference, I shared a presentation on the state of crypto in 2022. I aimed to characterize the health of the crypto ecosystem at the most basic level. For example, quantifying the number of active wallets, the population of active developers, & other dynamics within the ecosystem. The slides are embedded here with summary commentary below and linked here . My Top 15 Observations from the Data: 2.5m wallets are active daily across web3. Flat wallet count likely means relatively constant GDP in the ecosystem. We need more products to attract new users to bring in more GDP. Binance, Solana, Polygon, & Ethereum wallets represent more than 80% of those daily active users. Centralized exchanges manage roughly 100m total active wallets. Trading volumes are down 60% which is mostly driven by asset price reductions. DEX average transaction size declined from $8k to $1.4k. Centralized & decentralized exchanges trade at the same multiple & move in lock step. NFT buyers outnumber DEX traders about 35:1 over the last 6 months but the traded volume is roughly equal between the two groups. NFT trading volumes have fallen 97% from the top. 40% of NFT buyers use Solana. Because the average Solana NFT is worth 10% of the average Ethereum NFT, Ethereum retains 90% of NFT traded value. L2s (Arbitrum & Optimism) account for 30-40% of all transactions on Ethereum, but consume only 2% of the total gas, cementing their value. About $250m flows into L2s each month. MEV (maximum or miner extracted value) has tapered off due to FlashBots’ searchers. Lower MEV means users pay lower fees when they trade because the market is more efficient. Developers push about 300,000 smart contracts to Ethereum every month, a figure that has been flat for the last five months. Roughly 5,000 developers push code to web3 every week, down 20% from the beginning of the year. This number needs to increase significantly for the ecosystem to thrive. Web3 companies (aside from L1s) have begun to trade at similar multiples to their web2 counterparts. Web3 multiples are increasingly correlated to revenue. The investor community has matured its understanding of how to value a web3 company. This milestone will begin to shift the early & late stage private markets’ valuations. This is why marketing will become so critical in the next 12 months. Overall, the crypto ecosystem finds itself in a winter. I see it as the coiling of a spring. So much innovation has been unleashed in the last few years, most of us are still absorbing the implications & working to identify the best applications of the 4 fundamental innovations of web3 . A few notes about the data: web3 data is fuzzy. None of these numbers have the precision or accuracy of a publicly traded stock whose figures have been audited and are  governed by accounting standards. I share these figures as directional data, not hermetic evidence of a Higgs boson hidden within a blockchain. the data is collected primarily from Dune, but it includes data from others like gokustats.xyz & tokenterminal.com many of the queries in Dune are linked in the dashboard. I’d appreciate any help, pointers, guidance to improve them. My goal is to improve accuracy & precision over time.

Today, Adobe announced its intention to acquire Figma for $20b , valuing the business at 50x current ARR, the highest multiple paid for any software company of scale. Congratulations to team Figma on building their impressive business. Doesn’t this acquisition reset the market price despite this year’s 70% correction? After the correction earlier this year, public valuation multiples had reset to those of 2017. That year, Cisco acquired AppDynamics for 17x trailing revenue. If we assume a company recognizes about 2/3 of its ARR as revenue, then I estimate the Adobe/Figma deal at roughly 75x trailing revenue. That’s not a bear market multiple. Doubly true when the median public company today is trading at 6.3x. Not too long before the public market correction, high-growth startups routinely commanded 100x ARR multiples. If an acquirer is willing to pay 50x, shouldn’t a VC be ready to buy shares at 100x at a much earlier stage ? Doesn’t this acquisition reset the market price despite this year’s 70% correction? The answer is likely not. While Adobe’s acquisition may set a high-water mark, it’s a single transaction. The environment hasn’t changed much. Before this announcement, US venture-backed software M&A was tracking to its worst year since 2017, at about $7b, down from $71b last year. Public company multiples have floundered around 5-6x as a result of macroeconomic uncertainty. This week’s high inflation print damped recent public rallies. When modeling investment cases, VCs often use a basket of comparables -  not a single transaction  - to justify prices, even if that single transaction is a firecracker that lights up the entire night sky.

Ten years ago today, I wrote a post titled “ Choosing market segments on customer profitability. ” How healthy are the business’s underling customers? Today, that question matters more because of the recession than at any point in the last decade. Selling to very profitable customers benefits a startup. Account executives can charge a highly profitable company more than one without much money. I compared the profit margins of selling to a grocery store, a restaurant & a software company to illustrate the point. Business Restaurant Grocery Software Market Cap in $b 2.6 3.9 17.6 Revenue in $b 2.8 44.1 4.2 EBITDA in $b 0.4 2.7 1.4 EBITDA margin 14% 6% 33% The grocery store generates $44b in annual revenue but only 6% falls out the bottom of the P&L as earnings to invest in new projects like a modern data stack. The restaurant fares a bit better with EBITDA margins of 14%. The software company towers above them all at 33%. A third of their revenue can be reinvested in new ideas. Which customer segment would you prefer to sell to? In addition to industry, customer size also impacts profitability. Enterprise customers’ demand is price inelastic. The delta between a $100k contract and a $150k contract sums to a few basis points of their budget, loose change found between the Nappa leather cushions of the mahogany-paneled board room. But for a small company, $50k could represent the cost of an employee or a meaningful fraction of annual revenue. The single most important business decision in evaluating a business is pricing power. And if you need a prayer session before raising price, then you’ve got a terrible business –Warren Buffett Hermann Simon, the founder of renowned pricing experts Simon-Kucher partners, wrote this in his book Confessions of a Pricing Man. Product category & product execution certainly play an important role in pricing power. But so does the underlying health of the buyer.

This chart holds the secret to successful hiring of go-to-market teams. What is it? A stack rank of attributes within HubSpot account executive candidates that correlate to quota attainment. Preparation, adaptability, domain experience, & intelligence topped the list. Closing ability correlated negatively. The pushier the account executive, the worse the result. That result alone should encourage rethinking of AE interviewing. Mark Roberge ran this regression in Excel about 10 years ago. It formed the basis for a career at HubSpot predicated on consistent quantitative analysis to scale the go-to-market, which he detailed in the Sales Acceleration Formula in 2015 . I think it’s still one of the best books on how to repeatably scale sales teams. Mark isn’t the sole person to identify better ways of identifying great talent for GTM teams. Adam Grant delimited the types of interviews with the greatest predictive power . The biggest challenge in interviews: interviewers try to hire themselves. That bias is especially present in unstructured interviews where social skills & in particular the ability to establish rapport influences the outcome. Structured interviews, meaning interviews that screen for preparation, adaptability, & domain experience at Hubspot, triple the predictive power of an interview from 8% to 24%. Situational judgement questions add another trenchant arrow to a hiring manager’s quiver. What would the chart above look like for your sales team? Does your interview process screen for those attributes? The cost of an incorrect hire is 6-12 months. In a time when predictability & profitability matters more than ever, systematized GTM recruiting processes provide a competitive advantage.

By my rough estimation, there are approximately 30m monthly active web3 users (getting closer to that 100m user mark! ) The activity rates of those users mirror web2 finance apps. MixPanel recorded the activity rate of web2 finance apps at 10.7% DAU/MAU. In other words, 11% of users who use the app every month, also use it daily. Dune Analytics provides insight into the DAU / MAU of Ethereum users for August. User Type Daily Count, k Monthly Count, k DAU / MAU NFT 24 266 9% DEX 18 114 16% Total 42 380 11% Across both the NFT & the DEX (decentralized exchange) use cases, the DAU/MAU ratio is nearly identical at 11%. NFT use is a bit more sporadic, likely tied to single trades around specific art collections. The DEX use cases capture traders who tend to be more active. The nearly 2x MAU/DAU ratio suggests this is likely the case. The point: we may call new applications web3 applications that because the technology underpinning the software is new. But the users behave just as they always have irrespective of the infrastructure. Web3 users are web2 users. Which is yet another reason to believe the marketing stack in web3 is nascent but critical . Most users in web2 discover new products & services through marketing.

During Bill Binch’s Office Hours , he predicted many more software startups would achieve 200% net dollar retention. In other words, the average customer’s spend would double each year. I’ve only seen a handful of companies achieve that mark. The most notable public company is Snowflake which routinely reports NDR of 171%. Large NDR figures are hugely beneficial to startups. They imply strong product market fit. They provide predictable revenue growth. They result in better capital efficiency, an important metric in this environment. What would 200% NDR for five years mean for an average customer contract? Imagine your current ACV is $1k. Five doublings (five years of 200% NDR) multiplies the ACV by 16 or $16k ACV. The chart shows the growth for other ACVs: $5k, $10k, $25k, $50k. This ferocious ACV growth doesn’t come from wishing. Typically, it starts with a product-led motion landing one or two seats & tracks a sequence like this. User signs up for a product & pays. User champions team-wide usage. Account executive engages the team to help sell to the department. AE engages a VP or C-level executive to upsell the whole company, an enterprise-license agreement (ELA). In other cases, cross-selling products drives expansion. Veeva counts fewer than 1500 global potential customers. But since its IPO, the company has increased its average contract value from $780k to $2.15m per customer . Here’s an excerpt from their most recent earnings announcement. Note the emphasis on cross-selling & the relatively small new customer count for a business worth $26b that generates $1.9b annually. This quarter saw a major milestone with Veeva Vault Quality, as more than 500 customers are now using at least one Vault Quality Suite product, including more than 200 Vault Training customers. Strong momentum in the second quarter included a record 52 Vault Quality customer wins and significant progress on Vault QMS projects with enterprise customers. The key to sustaining high NDRs is ensuring the majority of the existing customer base continues to expand. As a company scales, renewal revenue begins to dwarf the new bookings. This is where longer-term product planning comes into play . Founders & investors alike would revel in a 200% NDR. Like Bill, I hope this prediction comes true.

The summer of 2021 marked an influx of dollars & interest into web3. Since then, the fourth crypto winter has dropped snow atop web3, but the revenue decline isn’t equal across web3 software. NFT marketplace revenue collapsed 62% since the beginning of this year. This chart shows the decline in monthly revenue from January to August. L1s’ monthly revenue has followed NFT marketplaces downward, falling 57%. The parallel revenue drop suggests L1 revenue skews to NFTs today, likely upwards of 75% concentration. On the other hand, the Defi (decentralized finance) sector enjoys more consistent revenue patterns. Decentralized exchanges (DEX) revenue has fallen 10%. Credit providers (lenders) increased revenue, as did yield aggregators. Said another way, bonds (web3 products that produce yield) have outpaced consumer spending in web3 through August. The two most salient NFT collections, Bored Apes & Crypto Punks, have seen their prices fall by 50% from their highs , reducing trading volumes & marketplace fees. There’s an important downstream effect. Web3 revenue has fanned out from its concentration earlier this year. In January, L1s (blockchains) generated 78% of revenue across public web3 projects . Exchanges clocked in second at 6.4%, then NFTs & marketplaces at 5.9%. Today, the revenue distribution differs meaningfully. L1s have fallen from 78% to 41%. NFTs’ share has grown 4x to 23%. Exchanges/DEXs have surged from 6.4% to 20%. As blockchains look to foster healthy ecosystems, they will need to build a portfolio of application developers across different categories. In the past, NFT applications drove most of the revenue at the expense of volatility. The greater the revenue distribution across web3 apps, the more predictable L1 revenue will become & the larger the overall value of the ecosystem. For this reason, I expect L1 ecosystem funds to subsidize application development in other categories in the next 12-18 months.

This chart shows the relationship between the top 100 public projects’ revenue and their trailing revenue multiple. There’s none. The correlation asymptotes to zero. At least when looking at the ecosystem as a whole. But let’s break the data down by category into the top 5 by revenue: L1s (blockchains), DEXs (decentralized exchanges), Credit (lenders), NFT Marketplaces (buy & sell Bored Apes), & Yield Aggregators (systems to maximize interest rates on deposits). These correlations to revenue growth resemble web2 software companies in the strength of their correlation. Two weeks ago, revenue growth correlated to public software companies multiple at 0.61 compared to 0.54 & 0.49 for NFT Marketplaces & Yield Aggregators. DEXs & Lenders are still mostly uncorrelated to revenue growth. As for the multiples themselves, these four categories have multiples bounded between 3x - 9x, which resemble web2 businesses. L1s live off the chart, their multiples measured in the thousands! Market Places TTM Multiple Web2  Median 3.3x Web3  Median 3.9x Web2 market places (a basket of etsy, eBay, Fiverr, & Udemy) trade at 3.3x trailing compared to 3.9x median for web3 NFT Marketplaces - strikingly similar, doubly so since I’m not normalizing for gross margin or any other metric. Exchanges TTM Multiple Web2 Median 8.7x Web3 Median 11.9x Web2 exchanges (a basket of Intercontinental Exchange, Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange & the CME) trade at 8.7x trailing compared to 11.9x for the 21 DEXs in the top 100 web3 apps by revenue. I’m not sure there’s a public market equivalent of a yield aggregator - maybe roboadvisors. The same is true of the crypto lending companies since they are a mix of secured & unsecured lending, so I’ll leave the comparison there. But I’m open to suggestions so message me with ideas. For these two categories at least, investors have begun to value web2 & web3 businesses similarly. I wrote about other convergences between web2 & web3 in these predictions . In the end, an investor with a dollar must decide the best place to put it. So it stands to reason that similar companies should trade at similar multiples, irrespective of their underlying architecture (centralized vs decentralized). The settling of multiples across the non-L1 categories should cascade to early stage valuations. Web2 & Web3 marketplaces should trade at similar prices irrespective of novel token dynamics. In addition, the market’s coalescence on classical valuation methods will focus web3 companies on revenue as a north star metric - something largely absent to this point. And for good reason: web3 remains in the installation phase of Carlota Perez’s framework. L1s’ valuations remain unconstrained by comparables to others for the moment. L1s are indices on the entire market: they capture revenue across every application built & yet to be built. The colossal multiples suggest investors expect stratospheric revenue growth as developers adopt decentralized databases & infrastructures en masse. All in all, this data suggests web3 continues to mature, an exciting prospect because as valuations normalize, more dollars, interest, & effort follow.

Last week, I presented an overview of the fundraising market at the Traction Conference in Vancouver. The slides are embedded above & linked here . My brief narrative of the slides follows The current state of affairs arose as a result of the Global Financial Crisis. Since 2008, the US experienced an unabated 12 year bull market fueled by four waves of money printing which increased US money supply by 30%+. This experiment culminated with Covid. The supply chain shocks combined with many more dollars fueled inflation, which the Fed is fighting by raising rates. Higher rates depress valuations of high growth companies & reduce corporate spend, slowing the economy. Public technology companies fell 60-70% in valuation. Founders feel this impact in the public markets, expecting a 30% reduction in ARR this year amidst an uncertain fundraising market. Surveyed founders expected a 10% decline in valuations. If public comps apply to private companies, then the market should expect a ~70% reduction in private valuations. Venture capitalists have continued to invest at similar prices & similar round sizes in the most sought after companies. But round volumes have fallen by at least 20% & likely much more. $220b in dry powder (dollars VCs have raised but not yet invested) will buoy valuations higher than expected. In addition, private market dynamics also invigorate this market. Private companies are marked to market every 12-18 months rather than every day. Similar recessions (1940s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s) have lasted 14 months on average & the stock market begins its recovery 154 days before the end of the recession. If history rhymes, we should see six months to determine we’re in a recession (2 quarters of negative GDP growth), two months of sideways stock trading, then the recovery begins. Some startups may escape a harsh repricing by virtue of their runway leaping from peak to ascent, avoiding the trough. Single auction winners also buttress the market. A single player sets the price for a startup round, rather than a collection of buyers & sellers in the public markets. Market prices accelerate faster with single-winner auctions. Publics are down 70%. Private data suggests a steady market but it’s a mirage. I think the market will settle in Q3/Q4 at a 40-60% decline to Q1 2022 & volumes will increase again in early 2023. Let’s see if any of these predictions hold!

In many board rooms, the most important go-to-market number this quarter is pipeline health. For some companies, the pipeline may be less clear than a quarter or two ago. Summer seasonality may play a role. Macroeconomics might also be lurking within the numbers. Pipeline fluctuations are normal. But any meaningful & unexpected surprise warrants introspection. Pipeline analysis often has four parts: Craft the sales sandwich to predict your GTM conversion rates & determine if close rates have changed in parallel. Sales cycle plays an important role: if conversion rates remain the same, but if sales cycles double, the pipeline initially thought to be for this quarter isn’t ready to close for a half-year. Build a lead generation calculator for your business using those conversion rates to understand how much lead volume the GTM engine requires to attain plan. Employ Bill Binch’s Mojo Metric as a daily measure of pipeline health for the sales team. The mojo metric captures the net daily change in pipeline across new deals, expansions, & sales cycle changes. Perform a second order pipeline analysis to understand where pipeline deviations start. A single pipeline number, say $7m doesn’t mean much.  But $7m ready-to-close this quartery with 80% belonging to the ideal customer profile on a $1.5m bookings number means the company is about to crush its target. Pipeline segments across five dimensions: Origin: marketing, product, or sales Product: freemium, mid-market, enterprise, other SKUs Stage: unqualified, aware, exploring, engaged, converted Sales motion: unassisted or sales assisted Customer segment: industry or business size Not every company will have each pipeline permutation, but most companies will have some combination. Understanding trends in those time series should shed light on variances in lead volumes. For example, a drop in product-qualified leads suggests a recent new onboarding flow filters traffic more aggressively, but the downstream conversion rates indicate higher proclivity to pay. Is the net outcome superior? Sales cycle delays shift pipeline the business may face headwinds closing this quarter’s number. A spike of mid-market leads because a competitor has sunsetted their product raises the question of whether to grow the mid-market AE headcount. Pipeline is prologue. It’s worth paying attention to.

Omni announced a $27m Series A . Omni builds modern BI with a consistent data model using SQL. Omni picks up where Looker left off. Looker’s fundamental innovation, LookML, enabled one person to define the revenue metric & everyone else in the organization to use it. Omni extends that insight by building a modeling layer that learns about your data as you query it, evolving the data model with each subsequent query. That insight comes from the founding team’s shared history over more than 15 years. The Omni founding team, Colin , Jamie , & Chris have gotten the band back together. All three were classmates at college. Then entered the data world. Colin & Jamie went to Google & Chris to RJMetrics. Then, Colin & Jamie became executives at Looker. In parallel, Chris helmed the engineering team at RJMetrics, spun out Stitch as CTO, & became VPE at Talend. During that journey, he contributed fundamental innovations to dbt, the standard for data transformation. Stitch & Looker partnered. This depth of relationships extends beyond the founding team into every part of Omni - the core engineering team, the product team, the marketing team, & even the investors. This shared history produced the insights underpinning Omni. The team’s extensive depth in data as builders & customers of fundamental innovations in data shapes the product every day. Omni will be another huge step forward in the Decade of Data . To sign up for the Omni beta, register here.

Last week, Office Hours welcomed Bill Binch, former CRO at Pendo, EVP Worldwide Sales at Marketo & operating partner at Battery to share his views on building world-class sales organizations. Bill & I exchanged emails about Deliberately Underselling as Sales Strategy . I asked him to share his views on land & expand team structure & quotas. But we covered much more. Here are three highlights from the session. First, Deliberately Underselling means optimizing the sales process for Net Dollar Retention (NDR). Logo-based quotas focus the team on speed to close. Sometimes, these plans have a minimum contract value plus a bounty. Another structure establishes land account executives & expand account executives . The company’s leadership should calculate sales efficiency on the combined OTE (on-target earnings) to quota ratio of these teams. A land AE with a $300k OTE might have a $600k quota. Her expand AE counterpart might also have a $300k OTE with a $2.8m quota. If they attain plan, the combined OTE/quota ratio is 0.176. Most startups operate between 0.15-0.25. This land & expand team construct recognizes the difference in difficulty between landing & expanding accounts; also, the potential difference in ideal AE for each role. Last, the plan compensates those responsible for growing accounts with a quota - in line with Frank Slootman’s philosophy . Second, Bill offered a bold prediction. Top startups will record 200-300% NDR as PLG becomes a dominant go-to-market strategy . Today, best-in-class tops out at 170% or so. We agree there! Third, Bill revealed his Mojo Metric , his north-star metric. The Mojo Metric reports the net change in pipeline daily. Here’s how to calculate yours: Mojo =  new pipeline + new_pipeline_expanded + deals_pulled_forward -  deals_killed - deals_shrunk - deals_pushed Each day’s Mojo reveals how much incremental pipeline the team has generated & informs the sales leader early on about this quarter’s health. There’s much more in the session including handling commissions on multi-year deals (TCV vs ACV), criteria for evaluating ramping account executives that echoes insights from the Vista sales playbook, optimal ratios for team construction, how sales has changed in 30 years & how it changes after Covid, amongst other topics. Bill is a master of his domain. Thank you, Bill, for sharing your expertise with us.

This is a paper bond from the US Treasury dated 1976. This piece of paper guarantees its holder $5000 on August 15, 1986. At the bottom, four coupons entitle the holder to $200 at the maturity date on the top right. The coupons represent the interest on the bond. Those four little coupons would lead to the creation of a $2 trillion bond behemoth. Prior to the early 70s, investors bought bonds & held them until maturity. Sometimes the bonds were good bets. Other times, their borrowers folded & investors lost money. Insurance companies bought bonds & hired people to sign the coupons, visit the borrower, & collect the payment. Bill Gross , a twentysomething at the time, did exactly this. But a few years into his job, Bill Gross asked his employer PacWest for $500k to begin to trade bonds. This radical idea created a market. The initial experiment yielded terrific returns & PacWest invested another $5m into the skunkworks project. Fifty years later, Pimco , the company Gross founded with Bill Podlich & Jim Muzzy, manages two trillion dollars of assets. Bond King chronicles the history of a financial empire built on the realization that a piece of paper with little coupons - just like the ones at the supermarket - could be traded. Reading Pimco’s history, I wonder what digital coupons exist today that we take for granted. Somewhere brilliant minds stare at paper coupons, dreaming of how to unlock trillions of dollars of market potential.

In 2020, revenue growth was the most important factor explaining a public software company’s forward multiple . The formula has changed since then. Net income has surged to the highest correlate of a public software company’s multiple surpassing revenue growth. Narratives published in newspapers trumpeting the importance of profitability correctly assess investor sentiment on stock exchanges. Revenue growth & sales efficiency round out the top 3 with gross margin & cash flow from operations margin rounding out the 5 tested metrics. Preference changes pop out of the data. Net income surges to 0.71 correlation up from 0.12 in 2020. Revenue growth diminishes to 0.61 from 0.81. Sales efficiency also falls by 20 points to 0.55. Later stage companies, those approaching IPOs operate with similar financial profiles to the public software companies used in this model. Earlier stage companies differ meaningfully. The model’s predictive ability frays the earlier the business. Profitability has surged as the most significant correlate & predictor of a public software company’s value. Inflation and Fed Funds rates expectations have influenced these preferences. As interest rates increase, investors discount the large future revenue & profit streams of high growth companies more heavily. Should the Fed lessen its tightening or inflation demonstrate a marked contraction, revenue growth would regain the top spot once again.

This year, private equity firms have acquired five public software companies, totalling $38b in value. Seven months into 2022, these figures exceed last year’s totals, something I wondered about last month. Since these transactions’ details are public, we can use them to infer how the private software market values companies. Company Acquirer Price Growth Rate Multiple FCF Margin Avalara Vista 8.4b 32% 9.2x 2% Ping Identity Thoma Bravo 2.4b 13% 6.6x 6.2% Zendesk Hellman Friedman 10.2b 31% 5.1x 10.5% Anaplan Thoma Bravo 10.4b 33% 13.4x -6% Sailpoint Thoma Bravo 6.9b 22% 11.1x -2% In the last decade, a software company’s revenue growth correlated most highly to its valuation multiple. In this small data set, growth rates don’t correlate to multiples. Neither does profitability (net income margin), which clocks in at -0.13. I wondered if the Nasdaq’s recent rebound might have influenced these numbers: strong Q1, crash in Q2, & then some resurgence of late. But no relationship exists between the Nasdaq’s price level & multiples. Zendesk & Anaplan announced their acquisitions within days of each other & their multiples bound the outer edges of the range: 5.1x & 13.4x. Curiously, free-cash flow margin correlates to forward-revenue/EV multiples at -0.996. A perfect negative correlation. The more free cash the company produces, the lower the acquisition multiple. I’m at a loss to explain this relationship. Perhaps a reader who understands the PE model more deeply will write in to explain it. However, we can glean some insights. The data suggests the market has attained a pricing floor. Multiples bear no correlation to the Nasdaq’s behavior, company growth rates, & profitability. The underlying business must have some base value which is the where the market has cleared these transactions. Software companies growing between 10-35% trade at 5-13x forward revenues. I can’t ascertain how record fundraising inflows into private equity funds might bolster these prices, but the billions burning holes in PE wallets must impel some activity. As 2022 concludes, transactions like these will inform late-stage venture prices. These figures will fill the comparables sections of investment memos.

Messaging has become the bottleneck for growth in web3. The lack of a native messaging protocol prevents apps from communicating with their users. Today, web3 apps communicate with users on Discord & Telegram. But these social networks aren’t web3 native. My Telegram username isn’t linked to my wallet. Knowing a chat user is the same who bought an NFT remains elusive but important. These communities don’t help new app developers with user awareness. So developers stuff wallets full of airdropped tokens. They hawk their wares by stuffing them into strangers’ pockets, which is problematic. These airdrops are a novel form of spam for both users & wallets. The problem extends beyond marketing & community building. Product notifications (your NFT has a new offer), customer support (here’s how to transfer your tokens into our liquidity pool), and peer-to-peer messaging within an application (hey, friend) - none are possible today in a crypto-native way. Products work around this limitation by linking existing communication systems to wallet addresses like email addresses, or Discord & Telegram handles. Some use machine learning to identify profile pictures across services to canonicalize user identities - no doubt clever. But these are sub-optimal because the underlying problems remain. Every new software era has its messaging protocol. IRC in the 1980s. Instant messenger in the 1990s. SMS in the 2000s. WhatsApp, Telegram in the 2010s. There will be a new messaging protocol native to the web3 era. When web3 messaging arrives, consumers will send billions of private messages to each other. Users inviting others will welcome the next hundred million users to web3. Applications won’t trail far behind sending product, marketing, & support messages. Messaging protocols are oxygen for startups & consumers alike. It’s time web3 had its own.

How much value does a successful software startup create per dollar of venture investment? About 10x, though it’s volatile. Let’s call the value generated per venture dollar the MOIC (multiple on invested capital). MOIC = value_at_exit / total_VC_dollars_raised Over the last 30 years, a venture dollar invested in a successful US software startup generated $10 of value. In the late 90s, the MOIC oscillated between 12-42. After the dotcom crash, the MOIC fell to 5.0, save for a brief period preceding the Global Financial Crisis. Quantitative Easing for the next decade juiced the MOIC to 8.5. In 2021, the figure topped 15 for the first time in ten years. No wonder so many new founders entered the ecosystem. In addition to MOIC patterns, the data reveals three startup fundraising epochs. Startups in the 90s raised less than $10m. In the 2000s, about $30m. In the 2010s, somewhere between $30-120m. This growth outruns inflation by a mile. The growth in VC dollars raised is  economically rational for successful companies since each dollar raised generates $10 of value at exit. As fundraising totals swelled, so did the prize. Average exit values hit all time highs in 2021. But the roads runs over cobbled roads. Exits arrive during periods of punctuated prosperity. Five surges in the last 30 years demonstrate the wisdom of making hay while the sun shines. When the IPO markets shuts, exit value regresses to the average M&A price. When the IPO window is open, average exiting startup values blast skywards, most recently near $1.5b. The Nasdaq’s performance explains 80% of the variance in exit price. I haven’t addressed several questions in this analysis. First, what is the success rate of software companies across the entire population? Second, what is the ultimate founder ownership at exit? I hope to cover them in the future. Despite all the changes of the past ten years - 10x growth in venture dollars & 70% correction in stock market valuation - the economics behind starting a successful software company remains compelling, even throughout downturns. Notes on the data Thank you to the PitchBook team for providing the underlying data. The data set includes only software M&A whose prices were disclosed & IPOs for US venture-backed software companies.

AWS announced earnings earlier today and reported 33% growth. That concludes this quarter’s IaaS earnings scorecard reports & provides us a complete picture of the infrastructure buyer’s index . AWS’s growth rate is the slowest of the three largest public infrastructure clouds. With about 39% market share, AWS reigns supreme as the largest provider. Larger businesses face more daunting challenges sustaining higher growth rates, so AWS numbers are expected. GCP reported 37% growth & Microsoft 40%. Cloud Q/Q Growth Rate Change Azure -13% GCP -31% AWS -18% All three businesses reported a decline in their growth rates. On average, these business units recorded a 21% decline in growth rate. Earlier this year, founders estimated a 30% ARR drop in their businesses .  Results from these clouds suggest the market isn’t as soft as the 30% estimate - at least not yet. The 21% decline should provide founders an input into their forecasts for the remaining two quarters of 2022, especially infrastructure startups. Anticipate at least a 21% decline in growth rate for your base plan.

On August 11 at 9:30 AM Pacific time, Office Hours will host legendary sales leader Bill Binch . Bill started his career at Oracle where he rose to VP. He led Marketo sales as EVP of Worldwide Sales. Most recently, Bill led the sales team at Pendo as CRO. Today, he’s an operating partner at Battery. Over the last few weeks, I’ve been writing about Deliberately Underselling as Sales Strategy . Bill & I have been trading emails about different ways of accomplishing this goal. In addition, many founders & sales leaders have asked questions about the details, the pros & cons, & the alternatives to this strategy. During this Office Hours, Bill will talk about: his perspective how sales have changed throughout the last three decades best practices in structuring sales compensation to achieve different sales strategies As always, we’ll collect questions from the audience during registration & interleave them throughout the conversation. If you’re interested to attend, please register here.

I’m watching public company earnings to identify early weaknesses in the software market . This week Microsoft, Google/ Alphabet, & Amazon report their figures. Today, Microsoft & Google revealed the health of their infrastructure business units. Company Q-4 CAGR Q-3 CAGR Q-2 CAGR Q-1 CAGR Q0 CAGR Microsoft Azure 50% 51% 46% 46% 40% Google Cloud Platform 46% 54% 45% 51% 35% Amazon Web Services 37% 39% 40% 40% n/a Good news & bad news. Microsoft Azure grew 40% y/y, declining six percentage points from the previous two quarters. The relatively modest decline suggests the cloud market is quite strong. Google’s growth rate fell to 35%, a 29% decline from the trailing 4 quarter average of 49% annual revenue growth. GCP’s data point is less rosy. Why do these results diverge? Here are some hypotheses: Google may have greater customer concentration in GCP than Azure. Declines in some large customers’ spend may impact results more than Azure. Google may have greater sector exposure to clients that are suffering through a recession: retail, ecommerce, &  advertising-based businesses. Snap’s weaker-than-expected earnings suggest ad spend declines should continue. Google’s annual ad business’ growth rate halved from 22% to 11%, lending credence to this idea. Microsoft Azure may have more customers under fixed contracts compared to Google, which may have more customers on a usage-based pricing model. UBP spend fluctuates by the month and introduces more volatility into bookings. I bet it’s some combination of the three. Regardless, Amazon’s data will break the tie Thursday. AWS is the largest infrastructure provider by revenue, so its trajectory will shed more light on the patterns of software buyers.

In Deliberately Underselling as Sales Strategy , I wrote about the importance of sizing contracts below customer needs to ensure customer success. “A key part of the formula: crafting the right account executive compensation structure to reward this strategy.” I received a pile of questions asking for more detail. Since then, I’ve spoken to many sales leaders & Lee Kirkpatrick who originally surfaced the concept during Office Hours on how to do this well. The trick: compensate AEs on expansion at the same rate as initial land. Typically, companies discount expansion quota retirement or commissions to around 25-75% of a new customer dollar. When deliberately underselling, the company should value the expansion dollar equally to a new customer dollar. Most management teams pay AEs for the first 12-18 months of expansion. For example, Cleo books a $10k land deal on Jan 1 and receives 20% commission this pay period. The account expands $10k again in Q3 and then again to $30k total in Q1. Cleo receives two additional commission checks. Customers’ account expansion patterns should inform the length of the commission period.  If most customers expand in month 13, then the commission plan should pay for expansion at least through the first five quarters. There’s a trade-off to this commission plan: the company may pay both the customer success managers & the AEs for expansion. Also, if customers expand by themselves, salespeople may receive commissions without expending more sales effort. For some companies, faster sales cycles, superior net-dollar retention, & better customer satisfaction outweigh the increased sales spend, particularly product-led companies or those with land & expand models.

“We need to start doing more with less. Finance told us our budget is decreasing by 20%.” This sentence echoes in conference rooms across many software buyers today, irrespective of whether the business is healthy. Boards push prudence during a time of recession, which cascades through the organization. Management teams expect to reduce operating expense by 20% predominantly through headcount reductions or hiring freezes - everyone from sardine startups to public megalodons. Account executives selling mission-critical software should breathe easy. Software does more with less. Software automates manual work, provides leverage, and the total cost is often less than a headcount. Though that may be true, the recession brings change. Product marketing & sales pitches will focus more on TCO (total cost of ownership) than on revenue generation for the first time in a decade, & return as a critical part of equipping champions to navigate procurement . AEs must convince the buyer can achieve their goals with software instead of a new hire. Doing more with less also means jettisoning non-essential software. Budgets will shift to higher priority tools as finance demands managers rationalize their spend. Have you asked your customer to stack rank their software needs? and where your product fits in? The answer may vary by customer segment and may inform the go-to-market strategy for the next few quarters. Narrowing the sales & marketing focus to core ICP (ideal customer profiles) improves efficiency & mitigates churn. It may be worth tracking new bookings in the ICP as a percentage of total bookings to ensure team alignment. Doing more with less means finding customers who benefit disproportionately from your software.

What is the difference between web2 & web3, really? Yes, there are tokens and initial coin offerings and drops and discords. But, today, they resemble each other quite a bit. Here’s my mental model: Imagine a startup that sells sports cards. A web2 architecture for this app would have five parts A transaction database: user 1 sold card ABC to user 3. A metadata database: user 1’s first name is Samuel and his profile picture is found at this URL. File storage: the profile picture file is saved here. App server: the code that runs the application. IaaS/CDN (Infrastructure as a Service / Content Delivery Network): the servers that run code. Compare this image to a web3 architecture with the web3 parts in red. Only the transaction database & the file storage changed color. We swapped the transaction database from PostGres to a blockchain like Ethereum or Sui , and the file storage from AWS S3 to a decentralized storage provider, perhaps Filecoin or ArWeave . Makes me wonder: If the database APIs were the same across web2 & web3, would developers or users notice? The rest of the application remains Web2, running on Amazon, Google or Microsoft servers.  Many developers build web3 applications this way: games, exchanges, cross-chain bridges. The remaining parts of the stack haven’t been recast as decentralized services, yet. Perhaps they will be. For now, the transaction database remains the most critical decentralized component. That’s enough to confer the benefits of decentralization to users, while giving engineers the tools to build a functional app.

In 2018 at Saastr, Jason Lemkin & I talked about private equity becoming an increasingly aggressive buyer of venture-backed software companies . Last year, private equity firms inhaled $29 billion dollars’ worth of startups -  a twenty-year record and 50% more than the previous peak. The high-water mark underscored the importance of private equity sponsors as an exit avenue for startups in black Sharpie marker. In 2021, PE buyouts constituted more than 20% of venture-backed M&A by dollars, doubling in the past decade. VC2PE transactions - startups bought by PE funds - record median sales prices consistent with strategic M&A - when companies buy startups. The most recent surge notwithstanding. Who makes for the most attractive VC2PE targets? Private equity companies typically target SaaS/IaaS companies at $20M in ARR or more with good unit economics and growth in the 10-30% per year range. Gross & net dollar retention marks must impress, and net income should hover close to profitability. PE funds target businesses whose bottom lines would benefit from improved internal operations. Most PE firms aim to increase a startup’s value by squeezing more juice from a Cara Cara orange rather than fertilizing the tree to make it grow. Often, PE firms swap out management team members to start the juicing process. Also, VC2PE buyouts trade at lower single-digit ARR multiples (1-5x) compared to strategic M&A which has touched 20x or more, depending on the public market & auction pressure. The software & infrastructure youth of a decade ago are ageing & growing into these revenue ranges. Record amounts of PE raised and sitting as dry powder ready to be invested, just like VC. Market multiples have compressed by 50-70%. Harvest season for a private equity investor. The combination means we’ve entered a market ripe for the picking. Expect PE to squeeze record quantities of pulpy orange juice in the next few years.

I wish I had a chart of the bid/ask spread in venture capital today. The bid/ask spread in VC is the difference between the post-money valuation between a VC (the bidder) & a company (seller). In the past few years, the spread has been tight. The market is liquid. Many startups sell shares to buyers at mutually attractive prices. Like the old stock trading floors with brokers yelling at each other, but in our era, we negotiate over Zoom coffees instead. Today, the bid/ask spread measures in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars depending on the company’s stage. A startups who had verbal offers in Q1 at $500m may expect to raise at $450m. The 10% originates from the Founder Sentiment Survey . But the stock market comparables imply the company should trade at a 50% discount or $250m. The bid/ask spread stretches to 200m on 450m or 44%. That’s not so much a spread as an abyss. When the bid/ask spread exceeds 5 or 10%, the market seizes up, like a combustion engine without oil.
No one trades. Investors pack their vests into a rolly-suitcase and head to the beach. Over time, buyer & seller price expectations will converge. The market will cough, sputter, & turn over again, the engine humming. A chart of the bid/ask spread would visualize when startups can expect healthy market once more and where it will settle.

Yesterday, Office Hours welcomed Lars Nilsson, VP Sales Development from Snowflake to talk about his learnings across 5 companies he helped take public. Throughout the hour, Lars provided insightful perspectives on how to build sales organizations. These the five most memorable takeaways for me. In early-stage companies, founders sell for the first three to four quarters. Then, many founders opt to hire an AE. Hiring a sales or business-development representative (SDR/BDR) can be the better choice. Incoming account executives will want to see a significant lead volume before joining, especially when selling into the enterprise. Teams often overlook storytelling as a critical part of effective lead generation.  Fear-of-missing-out or the inspiration of a potential future, stories equip champions inside customer organizations to sell the product through the buying process. Founders validate the effectiveness of their stories when hiring SDRs better. SDRs call ten-times as many prospects as AEs do. Much the better to iterate with greater speed and confidence. As the company grows, building the sales development team becomes the most productive source of pipeline particularly for enterprise-grade technical products. Hire for hunger. Then surround the new SDR/BDR with three pillars: strong training materials, a manager who cares about the employee’s success, and a peer to accelerate learning. At Snowflake, sales development lives within the marketing team. Lars manages his team through a single metric, meetings. Getting to an account late, a few days or a week after they’ve signed with a competitor accrues to the meeting metric (see why in the video). Last, exiting unlikely sales processes saves the company’s resources and boosts team morale. Closed - no decision is the worst outcome of an engagement. We covered much more in the session including the techniques Snowflake uses to align account-based marketing with sales development & sales teams; how to structure career paths within the team; transitioning accounts between SDRs/BDRs to account executives; and the right SDR:AE ratios as companies scale. Thank you, Lars, for the masterclass on sales development. Note: I suffered some technical difficulties with video in the last 15 minutes and lost visuals, but the audio remains unblemished.

Before the Second World War, King George journaled the end of Neville Chamberlain’s term as prime minister: “I accepted his resignation, & told him how grossly unfairly I thought he had been treated, & that I was terribly sorry that all this controversy had happened. … I sent for Winston & asked him to form a Government. This he accepted & told me he had not thought this was the reason for my having sent for him.” Five ampersands! In three sentences! Written by a king! Of England! I was excited by this grammar. I wondered why an abbreviation for the fifth most popular word in the English language doesn’t grace every text, email, and book today, as it did then. Time for a Wikipedia journey. In the mid-1800s, “&” served as the 27th letter of the English language . But when the author of the now-ubiquitous ditty “ABCDEFG” sought to rhyme “Now I know my ABCs,” Z usurped “&”. After all, what rhymes with ampersand? Over time, “&” fell from its regal perch as a letter. But I think it’s time for a comeback. I’m replacing the three keystrokes “a-n-d” with “&” in emails and blog posts. A pyrrhic productivity win or an homage to the Queen’s English? It’s not an either/or. It’s an &.

Let me tell you a tale of two software sales processes. Take 1: An ambitious account executive engages a sales prospect and hustles to sell the customer a mega contract that consumes nearly the entirety of a budget. Big commission check, high fives, president’s club, feeling fine. Nine months into the contract, the customer realizes they have over-provisioned. The buyer’s eyes were too big for their appetite. Time for a crash diet - a 60% reduction in seats.  The customer loses confidence in the account executive, feels misaligned, and blushes under the challenging questions from the procurement team. Either the internal champion pursues a competitor or management appoints another person to lead the next procurement cycle. In both cases, the vendor is out. This is overselling by accident. Take 2: The account executive deliberately undersizes the contract by a quarter or a third. Smaller commission check, but a faster sales cycle. The account executive tracks customer usage. Within six months, the patient AE notes the customer has doubled their seat count. A breezy email follows: “How’s it going?” which leads to a nonchalant upsell: “You’re over your usage and we love that. We should probably increase your contract.” The customer is in control. Other stakeholders compliment the champion on a great choice. She’s promoted . She refers you to a friend, who buys software from you and then tops up again. In the first scenario, the sales team records terrific initial bookings. Later, lower NPS (net promoter score) and weakened NDR (net dollar retention) mar the company’s financials. In the second scenario, the company enjoys faster sales cycles, greater NDR, and better customer retention, plus a referral. These are dramatized scenarios with professional actors. But, as Lee Kirkpatrick, former Twilio CFO, shared during Office Hours , Twilio employed this strategy to achieve top quartile NDR while achieving strong ARR predictability with a usage-based pricing model. Which means it’s probably safe to try at home. A key part of the formula: crafting the right account executive compensation structure to reward this strategy. Deliberately undersizing contracts trades short-term bookings numbers for better unit economics, healthier customer relationships, and more expansion. AEs are more effective too. Who doesn’t prefer to sell to happy customers?

Pop any venture firm’s website into the wayback machine , peruse the bios from the late 90s, and you’ll see statements like “I invest in Internet companies.” Or Web2.0 or SoLoMo . At the time, it made sense. But not anymore. Why isn’t time kind to these types of proclamations? Novel infrastructure often enables new software . We refer to each wave by its architecture advance: internet, mobile, cloud, data lake, single-page apps, containers, serverless. At some point, startups tinker enough with the new technology to discover the applications customers value most. Then the infrastructure innovations disappear beneath the delightful application and we move onto the next wave with its own buzzwords. Web3 will disappear just the same. In a few years, data startups, consumer apps, and software vendors will rise and grow - the same as today. Some of them will employ the four fundamental innovations of web3 : permanent ownership, paying customers with “equity,” regulatory arbitrage, and new governance models (DAOs). For example, a gaming company might build an app on a classic cloud stack on AWS and offer a decentralized peer-to-peer NFT exchange. Then companies will surge that test the definition. Is a CRM business serving NFT market places a web3 company? This is the great exciting and invigorating puzzle today. How does a successful company leverage decentralized databases, their novel capital structure (token cap table), their different regulation, and fresh ways of acquiring users into a massive business? I don’t know yet, but I do know when it comes, we won’t call it a web3 company.

On July 13th at 10am Pacific, Office Hours welcomes Lars Nilsson , VP of Global Sales Development at Snowflake. Having worked at five startups which went public - Snowflake, Cloudera, ArcSight, Riverbed and Portal Software, Lars is an expert in sales. He’s lived through many different go-to-market models and structures, through economic cycles. With all the changes in the broader macro-environment, sales leaders may be wondering how to prepare for lengthening sales cycles, pricing pressure in conversations, and an internal focus on efficiency. During this session, we’ll cover those topics and others. As always, I’ll collect questions from the attendees both ahead of time and during the session, and interleave them into the conversation. If you’re interested to attend, please register here . I look forward to welcoming Lars to Office Hours!

Last week, I installed Github’s Copilot , a machine learning tool that helps engineers write software. I often code in R, Go, Ruby, markdown, bash and other languages to automate some task or update my CRM , so I was excited. I typed in def get_tweets_for_user(username) in ruby.  Copilot completed the entire function in less than 5 seconds, like a GMail smart reply but for programming. I entered my API credentials, executed the program, and it ran. 5 minutes’ work compressed to a tab-key-press and a copy/paste. By the end of the day, Copilot had become essential - I won’t code without it. I suspect millions of others will feel the same way. I use applied AI elsewhere. Two distinct machine learning systems have analyzed this blog post for grammatical errors, clichés, brevity, style, and weasel words . Over the past decade, I’ve watched applied machine learning become table stakes for sales people at Chorus.ai. Chorus records calls between an account executive and prospect, then analyzes it for insight on style, structure, and content. When IBM’s DeepBlue dueled Gary Kasparov in 1996 for the chess supremacy, players wondered if the computer sitting on the other side of the chessboard harkened the end of the game. Similar questions arose after AlphaGo. Today, top grandmasters spar with  supercomputer-powered chess engines to improve their play. Many articles were written twenty years ago about the potential demise of the human chessplayer. Those sentiments echo in the articles about the end of software engineering that popped up after the Copilot launch. They have it wrong. AI enables us to focus to higher level tasks, not worrying about an errant semicolon, the syntax of a particular API, or taking notes during sales calls. These assistants are the future of work, anticipating, suggesting, guiding, correcting - helping us accomplish more by abstracting away toil. That’s why they become table stakes - everyone needs them to keep pace.

Funnel optimization for web3 companies will become critical to their success. Token grants cost 4-7x than traditional customer acquisition techniques . Other techniques, like incentivized referral, improve the economics but still tally 19 month payback periods. A year-and-a-half might be fine for a SaaS company selling a $50k to $100k ARR product, but long-term viability demands achieving 3-6 month paybacks of modern web2 consumer companies. Why are the payback periods so high? Many web3 consumer experiences ask users to complete a Tough Mudder to use the product. For example: Visit the app. Determine the chain on which the app runs. Check if you have a compatible wallet. If not, download one, create an account, and save the 12 word passkey. Check if you have a stablecoin in your wallet that is compatible with the chain. If not, transfer assets to the chain’s automated-market marker or via a cash on-ramp. Proceed through the app’s registration flow. Assuming a 20% loss of visitors per step, 60-75% of users will attrite before using the product. No marketer can coerce viable unit economics with that intractable anchor of a funnel. Early adopters don’t mind navigating the obstacle courses of raw products. The early majority prefers a smooth asphalt. Two decades into web2 funnel optimization has yielded the most effective answer: one-click authorization. Signup through Google, Facebook, or Apple, and you’re in. No mention of which database powers the app graces the sign-up flow. Web3 signup will mimic web2 signups to maximize funnel throughput - with one exception. Behind the scenes, the app provider creates and manages a virtual wallet with crypto tokens for the user. Until the day the user seeks to move their assets, at which point, the user configures a wallet, aligning the point of maximum intent with the greatest friction . In addition to enjoying efficient funnels, app developers avoid minting, staking, and trading fees until the user wants to move assets out of the app’s ecosystem. Virtual wallets will form the backbone of the next-generation ads stack , replacing the cookie with a blockchain wallet. In the next few quarters, web2 marketers will begin to invest more in participating in the web3 ecosystem, seeking the attention of a young demographic who has amassed material wealth in the last few years. Virtual wallets enable web2 marketers to advertise and measure ad performance across the web2/web3 divide. Blockchain infrastructure is beautiful - a marvel of collaboration across the internet. But like other breakthrough technologies that enable magical consumer experiences, blockchains will disappear from the user’s view, submerged below delightful consumer experiences. Virtual wallets are that first step.

Coinbase and Uniswap are two of the leading crypto exchanges. The market values COIN, Coinbase’s stock, and UNI, Uniswap’s token at about 3x trailing 12-month revenues. But should they be trading at similar multiples? As the market has corrected, so have the trailing 12-month revenues (TTM)/Market Cap multiples. They move in synchrony with an R^2 of 0.79. Just how comparable are these businesses? Coinbase and Uniswap generate billions in revenue. Coinbase’s trailing revenue in Q1 2022 approached $7.5b with 34% net income margin (profit). Uniswap recorded $1.7b in revenue in the same period. Their business models differ meaningfully. Coinbase operates a centralized exchange, while Uniswap runs a decentralized exchange (DEX). Centralized exchanges hold or custody user accounts. DEXes rely on users to custody accounts in wallets. The difference is starkest in headcount: Coinbase employs more than 5,000 people while Uniswap counts fewer than 100. Consequently, Uniswap generates $14.9m per employee, compared to Coinbase at $1.38m, a 10x difference in efficiency. This implies Uniswap’s net income margin exceeds Coinbase’s (33%) by quite a large margin. Both UNI and COIN have fallen from their all-time highs recently, suffering from recent revenue declines. During this period, COIN fell 75% from its high compared to UNI’s decline of 65%. These companies endure the volatility of the crypto summers and winters together. Revenue growth correlates at 0.60. However, in the last four quarters, Coinbase has outgrown Uniswap, and in the downturn, suffered less revenue decline. Coinbase counts 4x the number of users as Uniswap. Uniswap monthly transacting users (MTU) grew 366% compared to Coinbase’s growth of 307%. Uniswap generated 12x the volume per MTU in 2020. In 2021, the gap between the companies narrowed. Institutional investors’ share of trading volume on Coinbase increased from 56.2% to 68.0% in 2 years. Institutional buyers typically trade larger volumes than retail investors, explaining some of the delta. The converse may be true for Uniswap: perhaps crypto whales (retail investors with significant balances) dominated the volume in 2020, and to a lesser extent in 2021. Last, COIN and UNI are different instruments. COIN is a stock. UNI is a governance token. Stock affords the holder rights to future dividends and voting power on company matters. UNI affords its holders a vote, but not a dividend right. This could change in the future. So, should COIN and UNI trade at the same multiple? Uniswap grows MTUs faster, likely generates significantly more profit, and has fallen less. But revenue growth is more sensitive to market swings, the company discloses fewer operating metrics, and their token offers fewer rights than COIN stock. If an investor values profit margin over dividend rights, then yes. But if the UNI token never offers a dividend, then no. The answer isn’t clear today. We need standardized reporting for tokens and equivalent shareholder rights to compare equities to tokens: an essential step to enticing more investment in web3. Thanks to my partner Urvashi Barooah for inspiring this post!

For web3 startups to thrive, their marketing teams will need to spend marketing dollars to acquire users efficiently . Existing marketing technology won’t work for web3. Web2 marketing employs the cookie as the primary identifier of a person, not a wallet. There’s no bridge between web2 & web3 data, yet. The behavioral patterns in web3 differ driven by anonymity, communication patterns on discord and telegram, and the consequences of using tokens as user acquisition, as governance votes, and currency. There’s an entire marketing ecosystem for startups to build - and it will explode as  all the venture dollars web3 startups have raised rushes to find new users. This is my mental model for it today. Click to enlarge the image. On the left web3 app marketers (advertisers) gather analytics on their users. Web3 Analytics resemble web2 in theory but differ in practice. Of course, daily active users and cohort metrics will hydrate dashboards. But so will Discord user activity and token trades. Marketers must answer new questions: Are the people chatting in my Discord tokenholders? Who are the whales (the largest account holders)? How does my user base map to other projects’ user bases? Which users are trading my tokens; how active are they; where are they trading them? The Analytics systems power Segmentation software. Once a marketer has understood the customer types, Segmentation software clusters users into different groups, some subset of which will receive Campaigns. Advertisers wage campaigns through AirDrops into wallets, on Ad Networks, through Messaging, or any other number of channels yet to be built. Ad Networks  educate users about new projects while providing revenue to Publishers, application developers and content publishers. These ad networks’ will use public wallet information to target users. NFTs, governed by smart contracts, reward users for engaging with ads with token drops or other on-chain benefits. While many may turn up their nose at this idea, ad networks will become essential to the ecosystem’s long-term success, providing both distribution and revenue. Having built some of the previous ad infrastructure at Google AdSense, I hope we can reshape the web3 networks with user experience as a central tenet. Publishers running ads ensure they receive their fees through Attribution software. Attribution will connect ad impressions to on-chain purchases - on-chain data is public, enabling end-to-end cost-per-acquisition (CPA) ads, which maximize the return for Advertisers. Attribution vendors and Analytics vendors will poll various blockchains constantly to provide up-to-date data. Some will build this in-house, but over time, it will emerge as a separate category. Advertisers seek to optimize their marketing funnels. Introducing friction during the sign-up process increases the cost-of-customer acquisition. Having driven a user to a web3 app, the advertiser will employ Virtual Wallet Infrastructure. How does Virtual Wallet Infrastructure work? A user registers with a credential of their choice. Behind the scenes, the app creates a wallet for the user. The user plays a game or uses software in bliss because the developer manages the wallet on their behalf. No 12 word passcode to stymie the conversion funnel. Until the day the user seeks to move their assets, at which point, the user configures a wallet, aligning the point of maximum intent with the greatest friction. That’s the way I see the web3 marketing stack evolving. If you’re building something in the space, I’d love to hear from you.

Yesterday, Office Hours welcomed Lee Kirkpatrick , former CFO at Twilio to share his experiences managing through three different recessions: the dotcom era, the Global Financial Crisis, and today. Lee headed finance for the company from $15m in ARR to more than $1b. In addition, Lee shared his view on usage-based pricing and defending a startup’s great asset, talent, from poaching during the next recovery. Usage-Based Pricing Twilio was one of the pioneers of usage-based pricing. The company adopted UBP to achieve three aims. First, Twilio sought to  align its success with customers’ success. As small companies like Uber grew on the iOS store, their Twilio usage blossomed. Second, UBP reduced friction for individual developers to tinker with the APIs. Once familiar, they often brought the technology to work, expanding the account. Last, Twilio’s business requires greater COGS (cost-of-goods-sold) than most software businesses. UBP enabled the company to manage COGs and gross profit. Gross profit equals revenue minus COGS. UBP presented an opportunity to reinvent the account executive (AE) compensation model. AEs retired quota by closing annual contracts for a base level usage. Customers paid for overages at higher rates - a two part tariff . AEs deliberately undersized the contract commitment to ensure customer happiness and create opportunities to re-engage the customer for expansion. Contracted revenue constituted less than 50% of ARR. This model propelled the company to better than 130% NDR. Planning during Recessions Lee shared the story of his first promotion. His first task: a layoff. Lee underscored the importance of involving a broader team in hard-financial decisions to build trust. During those processes, the team should collaborate on different scenarios and identify the signals to slow, maintain, or accelerate spending. The areas to trim cost depend on each business’s situation. While slashing marketing program spend may reduce burn quickest and with the least difficult conversations, the company sacrifices medium-term pipeline. Lee shared a counterpoint to the reflex to cut GTM spend. At one startup with product-market fit, Lee and the team paused product and engineering hiring, and instead funneled those funds into the sales and marketing teams to sustain the company’s acceleration. Compensation Perhaps the most surprising and insight popped up at the end of the session.
During the Office Hours, we talked about startups repricing their equity with new 409a valuations . That’s important today. Startups must prepare for the inevitable economic rebound. Competition for talent will resume its fervor. When startups and incumbents ramp growth aggressively once again, management teams, who haven’t ensured their key employees earn attractive salaries and vest in-the-money options, risk talent flight. Thank you again to Lee for illuminating three significant and timely topics.

When Aileen Lee published “Welcome to the Unicorn Club” -  the article that coined the word unicorn for a $1b startup - the average public SaaS company commanded a market cap of $1.5b . I remember thinking a $1b M&A or IPO was so rare an investor might hope to achieve it once or twice in a career. Fewer than 15 SaaS companies traded on public exchanges then. With at least 20 firms and several partners per firm chasing unicorns, upstarts faced stiff odds. From 2007 to 2016, $1.5b marked the upside case for most VC software and infrastructure investment memos. 2015 Return Multiple by Round Round Post, $m Return Multiple at $1.5b Seed 8.7 172x Series A 28.4 53x Series B 74.8 20x Series C 139 11x Series D 269 5.6x If you were to read a memo from that era, you might have seen a table resembling the one above. It shows the potential return multiple from Seed to Series D at the median post-money of the era spanning 172x to 5.6x depending on the round. Within five years, the median public SaaS market cap exploded from $1.5b to $9.8b in 2021. The return potential 10xed. The largest startups kissed $100b in market cap and higher. Return projections skyrocketed. Competition fueled a surge in valuations. Then the stock market’s fall reversed the effect. Mean market cap halved to about $4.5b. 2022 Return Multiple by Round Round Post, $m Return Multiple at $4.5b RM at $1.5b (2015) Seed 35.2 128x 172x Series A 101 45x 53x Series B 352 12.8x 20x Series C 857 5.3x 11x Series D 2,226 1.9x 5.6x Re-running the multiples math for today, return projections for the typical growth round collapsed.  Series Cs dropped from 11x to 5.3x. Series Ds cratered from 5.6x to 1.9x by 66% - which is inline with the public market drop . The more market caps on unicorns compress, the greater the downward pressure on rainbow foals’ valuations. The silver lining: the median public software company in 2022 is three times as valuable as in 2015,  which suggests valuations should settle higher than that era.

OUCH. It’s been a brutal year for many in the capital markets and certainly for Amazon.com shareholders. As of this writing, our shares are down more than 80 percent from when I wrote you last year. Jeff Bezos wrote this to start his annual shareholder letter in the year 2000. But he might have written it today. Amazon stock reached an all time high of $5.33 before falling to $0.298. Bezos continued: So, if the company is better positioned today than it was a year ago, why is the stock price so much lower than it was a year ago? As the famed investor Benjamin Graham said, “In the short term, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term, it’s a weighing machine.” Clearly there was a lot of voting going on in the boom year of ’99—and much less weighing. We’re a company that wants to be weighed, and over time, we will be—over the long term, all companies are. In the meantime, we have our heads down working to build a heavier and heavier company. Startups feel this way today. Company performance exceeds employee expectations, yet the market values the company less than two quarters ago. Amazon stood fast to their principles throughout. Just as important, though, Amazon managed their finances well. Year Growth Net Income, $m Cash & ST Equivalents, $m 2000 68% -1,411 822 2001 13% -567 540 2002 26% -149 738 2003 34% 35 1102 2004 32% 588 1303 Before the dotcom crash, Amazon grew at 68% and lost -$1.4b in net income. Two years later, the company would re-accelerate growth from 13% to 26%, and again to 34%, while driving to profitability and increasing their cash position from $540m to $738m. A remarkable accomplishment in the most unforgiving capital markets environment the company had seen. All this took patience: Amazon’s share price exceeded the dot-com high Oct 23, 2009, a decade later. Ten years after that, the company’s value had compounded 20x. Of late, the share price again has fallen 40%. Bezo’s advice 22 years ago holds true today: patience and prudence throughout booms and busts.

The round extension is the most popular fundraising round today. You won’t find statistics detailing their rise in PitchBook or Crunchbase, but “reopening the last round” or “raising a round extension” precede pitches Startupland today. How does an extension impact a company’s cap table on average? Round dilution from VC dollars has been declining for the past decade. These figures exclude employee stock option (ESOP) dilution. In the last 12 years, mean seed round dilution has dropped from 25% to 12.5%. Series A has dropped from 30% to 20%; Series B from 22.5% to 12%; and Series C from 18% to 11%. Across financing rounds, dilution from capital has fallen by 30-50% in that decade. Cumulative Dilution Founded 2010 2015 2022 Seed 25% 18% 12% Series A 30% 27% 20% Series B 22% 20% 12% Series C 18% 18% 12% Total 66% 61% 45% Here’s a table of cumulative dilution for a hypothetical startup raising 4 rounds in one year. It’s not the implied ownership of preferred shareholders at the end of these raises. The calculation doesn’t include ESOP expansion, full investor participation in pro-rata, and other changes to the cap table. Today, founders sell less of their companies to achieve fundraising milestones today than at any in the last decade - a 30% drop in 12 years. A round extension that sells another 15% of the company leaves a modern founding team with more ownership than its older brothers founded five or ten years ago.

Suppose a VC gave you, a web3 marketer, $50m to spend to acquire as many users as possible? How would you do it? Conference sponsorships? Cross-DAO messaging in Discord? Sponsored social? It would be a challenge to drive any efficiency. The past isn’t much help, either. Web2 marketing channels don’t apply because they employ third-party cookies, a technology Google will phase out at the end of 2022 . Third-party cookies enable marketers to advertise to users who they haven’t “met” online yet. Third-party cookies encrust information about which sites I’ve visited. But history does serve as a conceptual guide. During the past three platform shifts, gaming ushered in billions of users: Yahoo Games for the internet; Facebook gaming for web2; iOS for mobile. Those ecosystems thrived because they offered large-scale, inexpensive distribution. Marketers can’t do that today in crypto. For a thousand web3 apps to bloom, paid acquisition channels must succeed. They are digital MiracleGro. What if a crypto wallet replaced the crumbling cookie? Wallets resemble cookies in some ways and improve upon them in others. Like a cookie, a wallet is a unique, anonymous identifier. Applications can create wallets on a user’s behalf and append metadata, just like a cookie,. In addition, a user can exert influence and control over each. Better than a cookie, the wallet records purchases on-chain and makes them public. Imagine being able to segment and target based on millions of users’ purchasing history in real-time. The wallet architecture also eliminates the opaque sea of intermediaries clouding the ad marketplace. Apps could encode user metadata as an NFT governed by a smart contract that enforces royalties. Data collectors/sellers would be paid seamlessly with each use. Obstacles exist: Blockchain transaction costs are real, but fees will fall over time. In addition, marrying a wallet with marketing data may be anathema to the prevailing crypto ethos. Questions about regulation also need to be investigated. We are a long way from that vision today. But it’s ripe for startups to pursue. The incumbent marketing hegemons aren’t prepared for this new world with limited knowledge of blockchains and systems architected for cookies. When the cookie does crumble, it will be replaced by a wallet. That’s good news because the fastest way to a marketer’s heart has never been through their stomach.

Lee Kirkpatrick is no stranger to downturns. During the dotcom crash in 2001, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, and the SaaS corrections in 2014, 2016, and 2018, Lee was either COO/CFO or CFO at Twilio, SAY Media, and Ofoto. In addition to his experience navigating financial markets, Lee oversaw the finance function at one of the most successful usage-based billing companies. Usage-based billing - the practice of charging customers by consumption rather than subscription - has become top of mind for many startups seeking to align their success with customer needs. On Tuesday, June 21st at 10am Pacific time, Office Hours will welcome Lee Kirkpatrick to learn from his experience. We’ll explore: lessons on usage-based pricing throughout Twilio’s evolution managing through uncertainty during different macroeconomic conditions best practices around lengthening runway If you’re interested to attend, please register . We will collect questions from participants before the event, weave them into the conversation, and answer live questions at the end of the session. I look forward to welcoming Lee to Office Hours!

The web3 market’s collapse in the last few weeks will reverberate across the ecosystem, especially for marketing teams. Blind airdrops, multi-million dollar ecosystem funds, sports team sponsorships - predominant marketing techniques redolent of the bull market - won’t last. A tighter fundraising market and competition will catalyze web3 marketers to adopt a new discipline. Why? Marketing efficiency is a vital competitive advantage. While this is just as true in web2 as in web3, crypto brings new complexities that create opportunity. Token efficiency accounting isn’t widespread. For example, most web3 companies don’t consider tokens as a cost-of-customer acquisition , but they ought to be. We need to invent new marketing math. Also, web3 user data doesn’t mirror web2 data. Wallets replace cookies, an improvement for both user and marketer. They maintain user anonymity, and reveal user behavior across applications. Public blockchain data enables look-alike modeling not possible on the web without full credit card or banking data. Those fundamental changes create opportunity for marketing startups to serve web3 marketers better. How will the web3 marketing stack evolve? In three steps: First, marketers will seek user analytics to answer questions like: How many users use the product? How is the user base growing? Where do they originate? How active are they? What is their lifecycle? Marketers will classify users by behavior. How many behavioral segments emerge in the user base? How much is each worth to the company? What actions improve their customer health? Last, marketers will implement campaigns that match different clusters’ to maximum effect across various channels. Incentivized token drops, Discord lifecycle messaging, cross-application promotion (reminiscent of mobile apps cross-advertising). None of this tooling exists in web3. But it will soon. This new marketing discipline will enable the first generation of crypto martech (marketing technology) startups. At the same time, this wave will improve web3 startup’s capital efficiency and ultimate success.

Should a 10% reduction in staff be considered a layoff?  In one sense, yes, because on a particular day, a collection of employees no longer work at a startup. But a 10% layoff shouldn’t confer messages of a financially strapped business. Consider the average annual employee attrition in a startup ranges between 13% and 25% . A 10% reduction-in-force (RIF) is less than the quantum of employees the business would have expected to lose throughout the year. Many established businesses force rank staff , a human resources discipline which recommends an annual 10% reduction in their staff as a matter of course. Jack Welch, former CEO at GE, dubbed it the Vitality System or Vitality Curve . He hypothesized 20% of the employees were the most productive, 70% formed the base, and 10% weren’t accretive to the business and should be released. There are clear costs to the Vitality System, but I won’t debate them here. When I read about a 10% reduction in staff in the press, I don’t consider it an indicator of a startup’s health. Instead, it’s an acceleration of an end-of-the-year human resources practice to maximize cash. Layoffs that are materially larger than average attrition benchmarks are a different matter.

Over the past week, I’ve analyzed the nearly 500 responses from founders who responded to the 2022 Market Conditions Survey . Thank you to all who participated and those who attended last week’s Office Hours to review them. The survey results review the trends in the public market, in founders’ minds, and the private market. Top 10 Insights from the 2022 Startup Sentiment Survey The typical founder feels 6.0 on a 10.0 scale, just slightly better than neutral about the market. During the live Office Hours, the audience was more negative, recording an average of 4.0. Software & Infrastructure companies are more optimistic than web3 and consumer founders, who average 4.8. Perhaps, the strength of public market SaaS & IaaS companies supports this optimistic slant. 30% of respondents have observed longer sales cycles. Companies selling to mid-market and enterprise see this pattern with about twice the frequency of those selling to small and very small businesses. Longer sales cycles may be a leading indicator of slowing demand. 45% expect slower ARR growth this year and on average are reducing their ARR (annual recurring revenue plan) by 31%. 89% of founders expect fundraising valuations to decline, about 11%, which is meaningfully less than the 60-70% correction in the public markets. 42% have changed their fundraising plans, roughly split in half between accelerating and delaying their timing. More than a third of founders polled are considering selling the company, raising venture debt, or raising an inside round. About 20% of those polled will conduct a layoff, and on average will reduce headcount by 20%. 50% of companies won’t change compensation this year, 33% will increase it, and 17% will reduce it. There’s no correlation between the amount of money a startup has raised and its runway. Irrespective of total money raised, most businesses’ have 18 months until their zero-cash date. To summarize, the data highlights that we’re living in a market in flux. Founders feel less optimistic and acting on it by reducing burn, trimming growth expectations, and lengthening runway. Many boards recommend startups operate with a plan that provides the business 24 months’ cash because the last two major recessions that resembled this one (1940s & 1980s) lasted between 12 to 18 months. The private market data, which shows a decline in round volumes, but stable valuations and round sizes, suggests top companies are able to command similar valuations. A word of caution: selection bias misrepresents true market conditions. Companies suffering through hard times won’t raise for a while and their numbers aren’t included in the May figures. Thanks to everyone who participated in the survey and attended the Office Hours.

As we navigate this bear market, I’m keeping my eye on broader market data points. A broad software buyer index would be the best metric to understand how buyer preferences are changing across the market. Fortunately, it exists. Large SaaS and IaaS vendors are precisely that: indexes of software buyers. Amazon Web Services and Azure, the business units inside Amazon and Microsoft serve and sell to small, medium, and large companies in every major geography. So do Salesforce. ServiceNow. Adobe. Palo Alto Networks. Software Company Q-4 CAGR Q-3 CAGR Q-2 CAGR Q-1 CAGR Q0 CAGR Salesforce 23% 25% 22% 23% 24% Adobe 22% 20% 9% 18% n/a Palo Alto 28% 32% 30% 29% n/a Service Now 32% 32% 29% 27% n/a Infrastructure | Company Q-4 CAGR Q-3 CAGR Q-2 CAGR Q-1 CAGR Q0 CAGR Microsoft Azure 50% 51% 46% 46% n/a Google Cloud Platform 46% 54% 45% 51% n/a Amazon Web Services 37% 39% 40% 40% n/a Here are the revenue growth rates for these businesses broken out by software and infrastructure. Q-4 CAGR means the compound annual revenue growth rate for four quarters ago. Most companies’ haven’t yet reported current quarter CAGRs, called Q0 in this chart. However, Salesforce announced yesterday that the company exceeded revenue expectations and maintained its annual growth rate. That should bode well for SaaS startups. In addition, their outlook, the prediction of how revenue will grow over the rest of the year improved. The rest of the group will report over the next 4-6 weeks. Their revenue performance and revenue guidance will reveal how software and infrastructure buyers’ behaviors are evolving with the economy. Keeping an eye on company-level canaries is important too. Slowing sales cycles, decreases in NDR (net dollar retention), and declines in funnel yield are things to monitor. I’ll be tracking these public companys’ metrics as a software buyer health index. If everything continues as usual, then the correction we’re living through should remain contained to multiples - not expand to harming revenue growth.

This Friday, June 3rd at 10:30am Pacific/1:30pm Eastern, I’ll be hosting Office Hours to review the 2022 Market Conditions Market Survey results. If you’d like to attend, please register here. The session will review the top 10 learnings from the data across the hundreds of respondents and answer questions including: how does the typical founder feel about the market? how often are founders considering layoffs, inside rounds, and venture debt? how will fundraising prices change, according to founders? which segments of the market are witnessing changes to their sales cycles? what does all this data imply for the market in the next 1-2 quarters for founders? Attendees can submit questions ahead of time via the registration form or ask questions live during Office Hours. I’m looking forward to seeing you there!

Yesterday, Broadcom announced it will acquire VMWare for $70b, the largest software acquisition in history. Remarkably, this goliath union transpires during the deepest bear market of the last ten years. This merger also suggests a wave of acquisitions may punctuate 2022, in particular, take-privates. Public companies can’t hide from the 70% collapse in multiples the way startups can. Publics are marked to market daily. Big acquirers walking through the aisles of the stock exchanges are staring at buy-one-get-one-free specials. Software companies haven’t been this cheap to buy for a decade. VMWare traded at a 4.4x enterprise-value-to-forward-revenue (EV/NTM)  multiple down from 7.3x in 2019, a fall of 65%, consistent with its peers by growth rate. Ticker Growth Rate EV/NTM Multiple VMW 9% 4.4x DBX 12% 3.6x BOX 13% 4.5x ZUO 14% 2.7x AYX 14% 5.5x Average 12% 4.14 VMW traded at 4.4x before the acquisition. The sale pushed it to 6.6x If VMWare is attractive, shouldn’t these other companies entice a cash-rich acquirer? Or a flush private equity firm desirous of a SaaS company’s consistent cash flow? Interest rates may be increasing, but they’re still low enough to make leveraged buy-out math work. Plus, publics are “always on sale.” Anyone can submit a valid offer. Even more, public company boards are subject to intenser scrutiny and more frequent shareholder lawsuits, which makes them likelier to consider a sale, even if there’s just one offer. Look no further than Elon’s on-again, off-again pursuit of Twitter as a real-time example of the tight-rope public companies must navigate after receiving unsolicited bids; and the destabilizing winds that a lack of other suitors and oppressive shareholder scrutiny bring. Acquisition targets are weakened after the market hears of an offer , and weaker still after they agree to terms and await a definitive agreement. In this environment, with valuations plummeting, plus uncertainty and fear rampant in the market, we might see a vibrant M&A market for public companies and perhaps the reemergence of the Barbarians at the Gate , the corporate raiders .

Today, I’m kicking off the 2022 Startup Market Conditions Survey to assess how startups are feeling about the market given all the volatility. If you’re interested to participate, click here. The survey has 16 questions. I’m looking to understand how startups are feeling about their financial outlook, fundraising, new employee hiring, and strategic options (sale, inside rounds, venture debt). I’ll close the survey in a week and publish the results shortly thereafter. If you have questions, just email me. In the last survey, we had more than 500 companies from seed stage companies to near-IPO businesses so I’m hopeful we can get a broad cross-section.

From every startup I work with, I learn about the different ways of building a company. It’s one of the best parts of the job.  By their nature, founders hold strong world views about how to craft their companies. Though it’s early in the company’s life still, Barr Moses , the founder and CEO of Monte Carlo , is an extraordinary leader. Many startups face a strategic question early on of whether to create a new category. It’s a heavy lift. A former executive at Gainsight which created customer success, Barr jumped in. Monte Carlo is creating the data observability space . At conferences, on podcasts, in blog posts, Barr has beat a consistent drum for years and at scale, all with the same refrain: data observability eliminates data downtime. It’s even in her Twitter handle, @BM_Datadowntime . That’s commitment. A few years ago, most heads of data didn’t think to allocate funds for observability. But three years after the company’s inception and due in large part to Barr’s doggedness (she often speaks at multiple events per week), Gartner has defined a Magic Quadrant for the space. One day about a year ago, I asked Barr what she looks for in candidates. What are her decision criteria? “Immediate impact.” She responded just like that, matter of factly. Her focus on execution velocity transcends the organization and sets the culture in the business. Barr lives hustle as strategy Another example - one of the first slides in every board meeting deck is the Keys Factors to Success. The KFS lists the necessary criteria for the company to succeed. This list differs from company values or vision or OKRs: What must the company accomplish to be the winner? And a last one. I’ve never seen a company before track the percentage of new bookings that belong to the ICP the way Monte Carlo does. Barr’s narrow scoping of the customer persona limits the product roadmap scope setting up the team for success, focuses the GTM teams’ efforts, and spins a flywheel of more repeatable processes ever faster. Barr is an inspirational leader. She and the amazing team at Monte Carlo continue to inspire others. Today, the company announced a $135m Series D to continue creating this category with relentless focus. MC is hiring in most roles. If you’re interested to join the movement, take a look here. It’s a wonderful place to learn how businesses are run exceptionally well.

With all the talk of recession, changing market dynamics, and the importance of efficient growth, many teams will be looking to boost their sales efficiency. How can the company drive more sales with less expense? Let’s start with the formula for sales efficiency. Sales efficiency = New_Bookings x Gross_Margin / Sales_and_Marketing_Cost Three paths emerge from the equation: Increase bookings : increase pricing without sacrificing sales velocity. Improve gross margins : reduce infrastructure spending, eliminate software bills, and/or reduce customer success costs. Decrease sales & marketing cost : increase quotas, focus on marketing channels with superior ROI (at the expense of exploration), and improve sales training/support. Each strategy is viable. Teams should select the path or combination that suits their business best. But these strategies won’t impact the sales efficiency number the same way. Why? Convexity. Convexity is a fancy word to mean one of these variables is a curve, not a straight line. Sales_And_Marketing_Cost is in the denominator, so it’s curved. A 10% increase or decrease in the cost won’t have a 10% impact on sales efficiency. New_Bookings and Gross_Margin move Sales_Efficiency linearly. Let me show you the difference with a chart. The x-axis shows a percent change from -30% to +30% from the baseline at 0 in both Gross_Profit and SM_Expense . The height of the chart is the months to repay (MTR) the cost of customer acquisition. MTR = 1/Sales_Efficiency x 12 Notice the red line SM_Expense curves. That’s the convexity. This startup has a 24 month payback period to start. If the startup reduces SM_Expense by 20%, MTR drops by 17% to 20 months - not linear! Increasing gross margin by 20% reduces MTR by a full 20% to 19.2 months. That’s convexity at work. Convexity works against the business in a deterioration scenario, too. Suppose SM_Expense surges 20%. MTR spikes to 30 months, a 25% increase - not linear again. If Gross Margin contracts 20 percent, moves in lock step to 28.8 months, a 20 percent increase. The differences between these scenarios are a month in each case. The point isn’t to fully focus on Gross_Margin vs SM_Expense . Rather, consider gross margin an important driver for paybacks; especially if the company anticipates big swings in either metric. The greater the delta from today in either one, the greater the convexity effect. As more startups peer into the components of their gross margin, Startupland should expect pressure on infrastructure costs - a direct result of sales efficiency optimization.

As the fiscal quarters of many startups draw to a close, board members and management teams are having one of four conversations: The World is Your Oyster, Time to Strategize, Chewing Gravel, or Go Big/Go Profitable. Here’s how these scenarios fall onto a 2x2 matrix. The x-axis is the Zero Cash Date: when the startup runs out of money. The y-axis is sales efficiency: a proxy for product-market fit (PMF). Typically, most startups selling into the small-and-medium business segment would like to be in 14-18 months’ payback. Enterprise startups should be between 18-28 months. Chewing Gravel : the startup hasn’t attained efficient commercial success yet and its bank account implies zero cash in less than 12 months. This is the hardest place to be. The company likely needs 1-2 quarters to develop a product and then 2 quarters to book business.  Options include selling the business, raising an inside round, or all-out-sprint to save the business. Time to Strategize : with a long runway but lacking product-market fit, the startup possesses the resources to scale. The north star should be efficiency. Minimize burn to lengthen runway and develop both the product and go-to-market efficiently. Go Big or Go Profitable : customers want the product and the company has faith that bookings and churn won’t suffer in a downturn. You have a choice:  Push to profitability; sacrifice growth for total control over your destiny. Or raise capital despite uncertain market to prioritize growth. Many of these businesses should find success in the fundraising market, but at different terms than a quarter ago. The World is Your Oyster : spend a dollar and generate more than $0.70 in gross profit? Have plenty of cash? You’re in Position A, the top right of this quadrant. Full speed ahead. An essential ingredient to deciding 2022 strategy is the answer to:  will our business be impacted by a US recession? Will buyers slow processes, exert greater pressure on pricing, or look to opt out of contracts? I haven’t seen a broad shift in purchasing behavior in the market yet, which is encouraging, but keep a vigil. Markets reverse in a moment. Some startups may find themselves in between this neat quartet of states. Take the more conservative view. If the markets roar back, you’ll have an efficient business that can grow faster with more capital.

The past three days may be the most eventful in web3 ever. Crypto assets have fallen by half or more, following their software counterparts. The attack on an algorithmic stablecoin’s peg harkens back to Druckenmiller breaking the Bank of England . All the tumult in the crypto markets will catalyze change.
Here are my five mid-year predictions for the major evolutions that arise in response. Consolidation. Five to ten L1s emerge as leaders driven by apps that attract users and net new GDP into their ecosystems. More dollars and users incite a positive feedback loop reinforcing the dominance of these L1s. In Defi, Lindy’s Law rules: institutional investors opt for protocols with the longest track records. Crypto-gaming succeeds in bringing 100m users to web3, starting with casual games which are easier to build, experiment, and iterate. AAA gaming titles arrive two to three years later because of their development lifecycles and studio risk aversion to invest tens of millions into a new platform. Money pours into web3. Despite the volatility rollercoaster, regulation inspires confidence in web3. Institutional capital floods the market fueled by Dramamine and greed. Unable to general positive yield from bonds because of inflation, fixed income investors pivot to staking to outperform the market. VCs revel in the short term liquidity reminiscent of the late 1990s when startups went public in fewer than 4 years. Spectacular booms and busts continue. Regulation . Basel IV will mandate that any stablecoin issuer become a bank and keep a minimum level of tier 1 and 2 capital . The first three Basel Accords set the minimum amount of capital a bank must hold. Each Basel Accord was authored in response to a crisis Basel I - the crash of 1989; Basel II - the dotcom crash, and Basel III - the GFC of 2008 . The US Government enacts the Securities Act of 2023 to regulate crypto assets: their sale, their construction, FDIC admittance for stablecoins, and the establishment of a new regulatory body modeled on the the Securities Act of 1933 . Tokens ape stock rights; DAOs mimic boards of directors. Token holders demand dividend/revenue share rights in addition to voting. Investors start to value tokens on fundamentals. The 1/9/90 dynamic observed in DAOs consolidates voting power into a few delegates, which mirrors public company voting and board election. Tokens and DAOs remain distinct from stocks and boards because of the regulatory arbitrage that enables startups to go public in half the time of the classic route. But they serve effectively the same purpose. Utility tokens disappear to the end user replaced either by a stablecoin or an ecosystem reserve currency . Token cap tables mirror equity cap tables. Web3 companies relax the fixed employee token allocation. DAOs issue periodic governance requests to increase the employee token pool to incentivize employees. The share of networks sold to investors asymptotes that of a web2 company at IPO,  but it remains distributed across a broad institutional base and some retail investors. Who knows if any of these will come true? But a year from now, I’ll grade these and see how close or far I was. Let me know your mid-year predictions for web3 on Twitter .

How much further can the market decline? The answer is quite a bit more. That may be hard to believe given the falls from recent highs in software companies approach 70% collapses. I went through my archives and found this post from 2017 that showed that the most expensive stock at the time was Veeva at 11.7x forward. Today, CloudFlare tops the list at 22.2x. If the valuation environment mirrors 2017, CloudFlare’s multiple would halve again. In 2017, the average company traded at 5.4x forward compared to 7.93x as of this morning. There’s precedent for another halving. Let’s look at that basket of 2017 stocks and compare their multiples in 2017 and 2022. ServiceNow (NOW) and Five9 (FIVN) have risen. New Relic (NEWR), Wix (WIX) and 2U (TWOU) are lower. Overall, this basket of stocks is at the same multiple as in 2017 (-2% delta). Why is the overall multiple higher? The high flyers have elevated the distribution at the upper end of the market. If multiples compress further, the top quartile, the fastest growers, will bear the brunt. Examining multiples by sector, Security and Data commanded the juiciest premiums in 2019 and 2020, a trend paralleled in the private markets . Those categories have sustained the largest decline on a percentage basis. In the last year, the disparity across categories has narrowed. But the investor preference stack rank hasn’t changed. Bear markets can be brutal because they resemble Xeno’s paradox of the race between Achilles and the tortoise. The market can keep halving a stock and never reach zero.

The public markets are deep crimson. The last time VC sentiment was so publicly negative, Twitter turned two. Term sheet re-trading rumors have surfaced. Public markets do impact startup fortunes, but only inasmuch as the prices at which venture rounds clear. IT spend is the more important canary in the coal mine. If customers cut their software spend, startups should expect a harsher climate. Gartner published their IT spend forecast on Apr. 6 .  According to their math, IT budgets will increase 4% and software budgets will grow 9.8%, the fastest of any segment. It’s anyone’s guess whether these numbers will reflect reality. Studies like this one lag patterns especially when market conditions change. Rather than reading these reports, startups ought to perk up their ears to the echoes of budget contraction within their customer bases. Pricing power warning signs take many forms including slowing sales cycles more account executives missing quota increased logo and dollar churn declines in funnel yield layoffs within the ideal customer profile The net effect of these signals are a cashflow shockwave - a sudden increase in burn. Account executives accustomed to closing their quota miss the figure. Marketing dollars no longer yield the same efficiency. Costs of customer acquisition spike. If operational burn remains the same and bookings decline, cash burn surges. I remember working with one company who experienced a shockwave that doubled burn for two quarters because of these dynamics in an earlier correction. No one in the company or the board anticipated it. Overnight, our time to zero-cash accelerated by nine months. It’s too early to say whether the macroeconomic factors at play will trigger a decline in IT spend this year. But it’s a good time to be vigilant of signal that presage slimming IT wallets, to calculate the company’s sensitivity to a resulting cashflow shockwave, and develop a plan to mitigate it.

AngelList published their quarterly state of venture report . I wrote down five data points that struck me: Q1 2022 was the most active quarter ever in Angellist history, and likely venture history. The term sheets signed in November and December closed in Q1, which may buoy these figures. In addition, late-stage investors moving into the seed stage market also buttress these stats . 83% of rounds in Q1 were up-rounds, which is statistically identical to Q4. late-stage market prices have declined about 30%. No parallel compression exists in the early-stage market, yet. Startup valuations. The 75th percentile of Seed startups raises at 30m valuation and Series A at $100m. Seed has become the new A . $100m post is consistent with what I’ve seen in the market for the most sought-after investments. Some raised a seed first; others particularly in infrastructure decide to go straight to A. 65% of seeds choose to raise capital via SAFE, a form of debt, rather than an equity round. If Seed is the new Series A, then this implies a meaningful change. Most SAFEs forgo a board-of-directors. A decade ago, businesses raising $3-5m Series As would elect a board. This data point confirms founders have maintained leverage in fundraising conversations. Web3 deals represented more than 11% of investments, the largest share, superseding fintech and healthcare. Web3 is a term that will disappear like web2 and mobile investing before it. It encapsulates software, infrastructure, and  consumer services-  unlike the other buckets which are more narrow. While the segmentation may skew the data somewhat, the data point does underscore investor interest in the category broadly. The Q4 charts may not differ much from those published in this report. Web3 will remain a top area of interest. SAFEs should persist as a dominant form of financing early-stage startups, and consequently inform board construction. Perhaps valuations and activity will change, but given the amount of capital in the ecosystem, the magnitude might be muted.

A founder recently told me he would have built his company differently in another fundraising market. When I asked him what he meant, he replied because capital was so plentiful and accessible today, he hired more expensive people, spent more time developing a product, and invested with a longer time horizon before demonstrating evidence of success. In my notebook, I sketched this 2x2. Capital availability on the x-axis and evidence on the y-axis to illustrate his point. In 2008, tightfistedness dominated the market. Software startups would need at least $1m in ARR to raise capital to muster a small round. That meant getting to revenue as quickly as possible, or spending as little as possible to generate income. Those constraints imply different trade-offs. The 11 year bull market transformed that dynamic. Today, a story is sufficient to raise a 2008-sized Series B. More capital has inflected the ARR growth curves upward. Ten years ago, a top decile software company tripled. Remember the triple-triple-double-double? Today, it’s a quintuple-quadruple-triple. Lenny Rachitsky published this chart showing top decile companies grow 5x . More capital enables this by permitting faster hiring, quicker software development, and perhaps less efficient unit economics. (Charting sales efficiency by year of IPO would be revealing if this is the case: good idea for a future post.) In addition, along the way, investors and founders began to explore more capital intensive businesses: direct-to-consumer ecommerce, semiconductor companies, real estate ownership, multi-year software development. As the market finds its new normal, I’ve been wondering where on this 2x,2 the market will land, and if companies will need to redefine PMF in 2022 and 2023? Will businesses focus on shorter term milestones again in more capital efficient categories? It depends on the depth of the potential recession and the impact to the capital markets. As an investor, I prefer faster growing companies: the time to IPO has lengthened to 12 years which can feel like eons. Up-rounds arrive quicker for hypergrowth companies - spinning the capital flywheel faster. Invest -> Grow -> IPO/M&A -> Re-invest. Given how much investors prefer faster growth rates and the massive surge in venture fund size, I don’t expect the ramen and ping-pong days of 2008 to return anytime soon. But perhaps Series A ARR milestones will retrench somewhat, approaching $1m again, especially if the downturn takes its time to reverse.

When I hosted this blog on Amazon Web Services, I used 5 products. I paid for them each in US dollars every month. One invoice. Suppose I wanted to rebuild my site on web3 using fully decentralized components. I would pay each product provider in their own token: one for storage, compute, caching/CDN, email subscription management, etc. Tokens reward the validators and the stakers powering the decentralized networks. Paying five decentralized providers in five different tokens means managing several wallets and monitoring token prices to hedge expenses. That’s much more work than the automatic credit card payment with AWS. It’s too much complexity for a simple static blog. Developers building sophisticated applications employ 10, 20, maybe 30 services. Can you imagine a site reliability engineer  managing 15 to 20 tokens, coordinating with finance teams to ensure proper treasury management, while ensuring high uptime? It’s hard to imagine such a scenario playing out. Instead, three possibilities are more likely. First, the ecosystem decides that infrastructure payments should occur in stablecoins -  like USDC or UST. This absolves customers from most of the challenges of managing various tokens. Second, the fastest growing web3 infrastructure players parlay their tokens as an ecosystem reserve currency, a petrodollar for gigabytes. Developers pay for low-latency storage with the same protocol token as they would pay for compute. Perhaps this dynamic drives consolidation in the market, paralleling the web2 infrastructure hypermarts of AWS, GCP, and Azure. Third, software engineers decentralize only a subset of the app. Migrate the database (blockchain) and the file system to ensure on-chain asset ownership survives the company. The remaining part of the stack remains on web2. How this quandary resolves will determine the most attractive places to build new infrastructure startups.

I used to have a clear answer to a founder’s question, “How do you value a company?” The question is just as important in conversations within a VC partnership as with founders. A valuation must have some justification to be compelling. Reflecting on this question a founder posed this week, I remembered how we came to be here, the three eras of startup pricing: cash-flow, multiples, and discount-to-future-value. Cash Flow In the aftermath of the dotcom crash, a valuation depression kept valuations low. A few months before Lehman fell, I joined Redpoint. I was taught to ask founders how much capital they needed to attain milestones and circumspect the financial model. How much money did the company need to have 18-24 months of runway? The model says $4m? Great. Add a quarter or two of burn as an insurance policy. Voila! The art of startup pricing in a recipe. $5m on $25m post. Multiples In the mid-2010s, public market pricing techniques seeped into venture lingo - the same time another Wall Street peccadillo appeared in Startupland, the Patagonia vest. Startups were priced first on forward-revenue multiple. Sum the next-twelve months of projected revenue, tabulate the public comps’ forward multiple, and multiply. Forward revenue multiples gave way to forward ARR multiples. ARR figures are more aggressive still. They are the run rate of a business, not recognized revenue.  But, these startups grow faster than the public companies so the market should give them the benefit of the doubt. The market priced companies at 10x forward ARR, and as the venture asset class grew from $30b to $300b+, forward ARR multiples eclipsed their double-digit roots and grew by an order of magnitude. Last year, 100x, 200x, and 400x multiples graced term sheets and greased board room approvals . Discount-to-Ultimate-Value That 10x growth marked the start of the third era: forward multiples in the hundreds had lost the credibility to justify valuations. Instead, the market evolved to discount to ultimate value. If Salesforce is a $200b company and a CRM startup captures 1% of Salesforce’s market, the startup’s a unicorn . If we buy 15% of that company for $10m, we can make a 10x. Home-office rodeo redux .  Web3/crypto startups are often priced this way. Ethereum sits atop a $350B market cap perch. 1% of Ethereum for the next L1 means a $3b company, a triplicorn. But when the valuations of these comparables fall significantly, say more than 60% as software publics have, the initial investment case and price justification suffers. The startup needs 60% more market share to be worth the same. Today With $200-300b invested in venture capital this year, the dominant pricing force remains abundant capital supply seeking limited investment opportunities. Since only one VC establishes the market-clearing price, valuations can remain elevated, a phenomenon extant in the early stage market. . Justifying a price is now some combination of these three depending on the company, the auction pressure , and the public market comparables, and the investment philosophy of the VC. That’s why startup pricing is so uneven, murky, and sometimes gobsmacking. The market isn’t aligned on a pricing rubric. We’re in between pricing eras.

Imagine you’re a venture investor. You find a great company. You buy 16% of the company for $8m at $50m post-money valuation. Six months later, the company raises $100m at $500m. Things have gone very well. Your 8m has 10xed. Naturally, you ride an imaginary horse around the room, galloping with glee. Now you face an important strategic question: Do you invest your full pro-rata of $16m?  Pro-rata is the right to invest more to maintain their percentage ownership. Venture firms reserve capital for these financings. If you invest an additional $16m to maintain your ownership, the investment multiple falls to 3.3x: 80m / (8m + 16m). Two-thirds of your dollars are invested at a much higher price. Which path do you pursue? Stay pat to maximize the investment multiple? Or double down to $16m and juice the holding value - the total value of the position? This is one of the core strategic questions venture firms debate. In the last ten years, the dominant strategy has been optimizing the holding value.  Valuation multiples expanded; the public market lapped up high growth technology companies; acquirers devoured others at premium prices. Special purpose vehicles, growth/opportunity funds, LPs investing directly alongside VCs - these are all tactics to optimize holding value. The recent 60% correction in the public market might compel you to consider a different view than the dominant one in the last decade. What if the third round is a down round?  Your investment multiple will compress and you may be forced to invest more to maintain your ownership - called a pay-to-play provision. Your great return might degrade to a mediocre outcome as a consequence. Investing $24m to get a 3x isn’t bad in absolute terms, but a far cry from the glory of your recent home office rodeo. Fund size should factor into the decision. Suppose your fund is $75m. This investment, which is about 10% of the fund, will return the fund. Sensational. Invest another 16m and 30% of your fund rides on one company. Is that wise? It depends on your outlook and confidence in the business (and whether your LP Agreement allows it). Rather than doubling down, you could allocate those $16m to a new investment in an earlier stage company at a lower valuation. Which option will generate a better return? The greater your confidence in stable prices in the fundraising market, the more likely you are to double down. The less confident, the greater your reservations about reserves. How you answer this question for every company will influence your fund’s ultimate performance and how often you’ll be chewing gravel or be ace-high celebrating on your steed.

Defi lending protocols, distributed exchange protocols, cross-chain messaging protocols, communication protocols. All of them are in the process of being invented, debated, and adopted. In a roundabout way, this post is about the emergence of web3 protocols. But it’s about how we got here. For 20 years, from 1970 to 1990s, the first Protocol Wars raged over clacking IBM Model M mechanical keyboards. At the time, computers were connected by local networks. Stanford operated a computer network. DARPA and University College London also. But these networks couldn’t talk to each other in a standardized way -  paralleling the limited interoperability of blockchains today. How would computers find each other? How would they exchange files or messages or emails? How would they secure data on the wire? In 1974 and 1975, a team at DARPA including Vint Cerf developed a standard called TCP/IP . TCP/IP is a collection of standards that today are ubiquitous: HTTP (web browsing), IMAP and SMTP (for emails), UDP (broadcast video), and many others. After significant testing, the US Department of Defense standardized its networks on TCP/IP in 1981. Berkeley embedded TCP/IP into Unix not long thereafter. In the private sector, IBM, DEC, and Xerox built proprietary protocols to connect business networks. These closed-source competitors duked it out market share for more than 20 years. Not to be outdone, startups vied for business, writing TCP/IP stacks and selling them to big computer makers. The largest of the era, FTP Software , went public as a hugely successful business before being sold for less than cash after Microsoft embedded a TCP/IP stack in Windows 95 for free, marking the end of the era. During these decades, the conference circuit featured architecture debates from protocol preachers sporting spicy t-shirts . Web3 builders are debating their way through this era’s protocol wars, defining the networking stack to connect blockchains. Ethereum wrote a virtual machine, EVM. The EVM has become an early standard for smart contract runtimes. Cosmos has been promoting the Inter Blockchain Connectivity (IBC) standard for messaging. There are point-to-point cross-chain bridges like Wormhole that recall PPP in the TCP/IP array . The next era in web3 will feature a panoply of three-letter acronyms, debates over communications protocols at the most fundamental levels written on modern, clicky mechanical keyboards sporting Cherry Brown switches, and, yes, colorful couture. It wouldn’t be a protocol war otherwise.

Revenue, Revenue_USD, Revenue_new, rev2, customer_revenue. Do you recognize these? They might be the column names you might find in your BI or analytics tool. Which is the one to use? You pick Revenue_new (it’s new, after all!) and proceed with your analysis. A few minutes into the meeting with the sales team, the group startles: the data doesn’t match their expectations. Something’s wrong. What data are you using?! Revenue_new? Oh, Revenue_new is the old column. The company moved to customer_revenue last quarter when we hired a new VP of Finance and they updated the definition. Airbnb faced this problem, too. Circa 2010, there was only one full-time analyst at the company working on data, and his laptop was effectively the company’s data warehouse. Queries were often run directly against the production databases, and expensive queries occasionally caused serious incidents and took down Airbnb.com. As the company grew, problems worsened: Years ago, when Brian, our CEO, would ask simple questions like which city had the most bookings in the previous week, Data Science and Finance would sometimes provide diverging answers using slightly different tables, metric definitions, and business logic. So Airbnb built an internal product Minerva to solve these problems . Minerva is ubiquitous inside Airbnb - it manages more than 12,000 metrics and 4,000 dimensions across 200 data producers. MetricFlow is an open-source Minerva. With MetricFlow, a user can search for metrics, find the one approved by the outgoing VP Finance, receive a notification when the new VPF updates it, see the calculation, and identify the metric’s owner. MetricFlow and Minerva are useful for BI, but they do more. Teams can build on them as a platform. Imagine the customer success team asks for a revenue chart in their CRM: it’s as easy as siphoning the data from MetricsFlow via a API call. The software is future proofed. If the definition changes, so do the charts. Updates cascade through the organization. Here’s a demo that goes into a bit more detail. In the two weeks since launch, MetricFlow has grown to more than 400 Github stars, and is now the most popular metrics framework by that standard. If you’re curious about metrics stores and how they fit into the modern data stack and data mesh, you might be interested to attend the first Metric Store Summit next week where people from Spotify, Airbnb, Mode, and Hex will be discussing them. The title of this post is a play on words from Coleridge’s Rime of the Ancient Mariner . Bad metrics are like salt water. Not much use to a sailor or an analyst.

As I’ve explored web3 I’ve been forming a mental model of the major innovations powering this enormous wave of innovation. At the moment, I see four clusters: A permanent ownership record that exists beyond and outside a company. The photos I take, the movies I buy, the music I rent, the emails I write and receive, the messages I send - all of these are captive. They exist within a database controlled by Google, Netflix, Spotify, Gmail, WhatsApp. If these services disappear, so does my ownership/rentership record. In a future where digital assets are worth not $10 or $20, but hundreds or thousands of dollars, ownership that survives a company becomes an essential substrate of commerce. Paying customers in “equity.” Internet hegemons have decimated entire spaces: social networks, advertising technology, video streaming and rental, paid email, infrastructure. Their economies of scale and network effects mount significant barriers to competition. What’s a startup to do? Compete on a different axis: reward users with tokens. A social network rewards its most valuable users in the coin of the realm. Same for music or file storage or graphics processing. As the network becomes more valuable, so does the user’s stake in the company. Web3 companies employ tokens to reward their customers for providing value. Because this technique is so new, startups have the upper hand: Innovator’s Dilemma redux. Regulatory arbitrage. Twenty years ago, startups IPOed after 4 years. Today, it’s 12, driven by several factors but regulatory costs present the principal one. Crypto companies access pools of capital web2 companies cannot because the regulation doesn’t exist. Where nascent rules are present, the regulation isn’t yet a warren of legalese- yet. Within this freedom to maneuver, Defi protocols invent new financial instruments. The perp , a perpetual swap, has become the most traded crypto derivative). Perps don’t exist outside crypto. DAO/Foundations : open-source software is arguably the most important motive force powering innovation in technology. Open-source software powers every server and most software. Crypto empowers open-source projects to monetize their innovation in a way web2 never achieved. DAOs bind the loose community of open-source software contributors through tokens. Tokens provide an ongoing financial link that aligns long-term incentives. Foundations endowed with significant token stakes fuel the ongoing protocol development, balancing the capitalism needed to fuel progress with the benevolence intrinsic to the open-source ethos. But, wait. There’s one more! The fifth cluster of innovation benefits central banks, not startups. If I were an economist with aspirations of working within a central bank, I would be jubilant for the future. Central Bank Digital Coins (CBDCs) are akin to discovering quantum physics for central banks. I can imagine the quips in the halls at the Fed, “Pshhh.  Paper money is so Newtonian.” CBDCs are programmable money: central bank digital coins enable a government to focus stimulus as granularly or as broadly as they like. Imagine a reserve bank stimulating the electric bicycle industry in the Kansas City metropolitan area by providing residents new US digital dollars that are only valid within bike shops in Kansas City. As the number of developers in the ecosystem grows geometrically, as the foundations of this ecosystem are lain, and the applications blossom, I’m confident web3 will enable a tsunami of innovation. And at the core, those products, systems, and infrastructures will take advantage of some of these four core advances. This quartet equips web3 companies with advantages web2 businesses simply can’t counter.

There are roughly 27m software developers in the world . Only about 18k of them , or 0.07%, work on crypto or web3 every month. Those 18,000 active engineers have created $2 trillion in market cap across the top 100 projects - $112m of value per person. With such massive potential impact, why are there so few engineers working on web3? Crypto is young. Crypto is volatile. Crypto requires learning new languages. Every quarter, RedMonk publishes a chart of the most popular developer languages .  The two most popular languages for authoring smart contracts are Solidity for Ethereum and Rust for Solana and Cosmos, circled in red. Both of these are niche languages compared to the popularity of Javascript which alone counts more than 16.4m developers - about 61% . From the same report: “Upwards of 2.5m developers joined the Javascript community in the last six months.” Javascript emerged as a front-end language but now, with technologies like Node.js power back-end applications, too. In Q1 2022, Solidity, Ethereum’s smart contract language, appeared on the chart for the first time. Rust remained the 19th most popular language, though it is the fastest-growing. But it’s equally prevalent as Emacs Lisp. I don’t think I’ve  met anyone who writes Emacs Lisp even though I’ve worked in Startupland for more than a decade, and roughly a similar number of engineers write Solidity. Solidity and Rust are both influenced by lower level languages including C++. The learning curve for these languages is significant. With so few writing in these languages, web3 companies face recruiting challenges to staff their teams which limits their speed. It’s not to say that the web3 developer experience isn’t improving rapidly. Spinning up an Ethereum light node is as simple as pasting a few lines of bash script into a terminal . But there are many massive opportunities to improve the web3 developer experience and that would invite many more engineers to work in crypto.  Imagine if half a million of the US engineering population suddenly were capable of working in web3. How many trillions of value might they create?

Before a startup is founded, no stock exists. By the time it’s public, more than 100m shares exist across hundreds of shareholders (employees, institutional investors, retail investors). Through its life, the company might buy back some shares, destroying them and reducing share count. The startup can inflate share count by creating shares. Conversely, the company can deflate share count by buying shares and destroying them. Over the life of a company, share count can vary significantly. The same is true in crypto. When a crypto project launches a token, no tokens exist. To succeed, the crypto company must distribute tokens to thousands of investors to hold, trade and stake. Just as tokens can be created, they can be destroyed. For example, users burn tokens to execute a smart contract. The network might slash tokens when a malicious validator tries to steal by suggesting an invalid transaction block. How similar are equity inflation and deflation patterns to tokens? The answer surprised me. Here are the total shares outstanding for a few public SaaS companies. Blackboard (BLKB) increases share count steadily. Dropbox (DBX) has crested. But most of the others are up and to the right. Older companies SaaS companies (Salesforce/CRM) and newer ones (Coupa/COUP) show similar trajectories. Company age doesn’t govern share count much, rather the goals of the company do: more team growth and fundraising means minting more shares. FAANG stocks differ. Apple (AAPL) deflates their share count aggressively: they’ve spent $85.5b to repurchase shares during the past decade . Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG) and Facebook/Meta (FB) deflate their share counts, too. Public software median inflation rate rests at 5% annually, including shares for new employees, retention grants for current employees and primary stock sales in the public market to raise cash. The distribution is quite wide: Apple deflates shares 3% annually while while Bill grows share count by about 20%. The patterns for crypto token issuance diverge wildly compared to SaaS stocks. I selected nine projects to contrast them. ATOM (Cosmos) token count surged and flattened. AVAX (Avalanche) resembles a ziggurat, steady increases on particular dates. BNB (Binance) varies between inflation and deflation, like LUNA (Terra). ETH (Ethereum) follows a ruler’s straight edge, similar to DOGE (Dogecoin) and HNT (Helium). Across this set of projects, the median inflation rate is 25% - much higher than SaaS companies. There are some distinctions between crypto token counts and share counts: most of these crypto businesses are earlier on in their lives which means we should see more inflation. Early businesses tend to create more instruments to hire, grow, and incentivize. tokens resemble equity in most ways, but possess one additional function: they can be used to pay for service . Token Trailing 2 Year Inflation Rate Founded Year BNB 3.4% 2017 DOGE 3.5% 2013 ETH 4.9% 2013 LUNA 13% 2018 ATOM 25% 2014 HNT 87% 2013 UNI 151% 2018 AVAX 388% 2019 SOL 405% 2017 However, some more mature projects, even utility tokens, have fallen to similar token inflation their SaaS cousins. As more crypto companies launch, many will define their token strategy that should consider: the purpose of the token: utility v governance the goals of the token: 1/9/90 participation or broader? allocations across community, investors, validators, and developer incentives Ultimately, crypto token emission schedules should vary from SaaS companies because each instrument has its own purpose, but there are more than a few resemblances.

Could Instacart’s self-repricing become the first of many? It’s quite possible. The company announced it would mark its shares to a market price 40% less the last round. In a fundraising environment awash with capital and term sheets lapping up on the front doors of many startups, why might we see more self-repricings? Talent. Startups appeal to candidates span many dimensions: influence, category creation, smaller teams. But lottery-ticket upside remains one of the most important. Join the right company and it will change your economic life. Today’s talent market may be the most competitive on record. The current herd of unicorns, hundreds in number, sport saddlebags loaded with billions of dollars, each vying for the best staff. Amidst this competitive jostling, equity upside trumps perks. Reducing the strike/grant price of an option or RSU (restricted stock unit) increases the potential upside for future grant recipients - a group comprising both existing employees receiving grants and new hires. In other words, our equity now has more upside - come work here! If more startups do self-reprice, boards and heads of people/HR should ensure hires whose options are now less compelling receive some additional shares to ensure fairness and remain motivated. How broad might startup self-repricing become? It’s hard to say, but the motive force will be competition in the talent market. Startups whose trajectories remain stellar may never consider the idea. The best companies will always find buyers willing to pay top dollar both in the private and the public markets - public market multiples be damned. New rounds may also influence this decision. During diligence, investors forecast the potential return of an investment, basing the ultimate value of a business on other companies, called comparables or comps. If the comps are worth 40% more or 40% less, return scenarios shift meaningfully. Multiples have compressed by 53% for the 25th percentile public software company and 66% for the 75th percentile (fastest growers). As the public markets have fallen more than 50%, Series C valuations have fallen about 30% year to date. With interest rates continuing to increase by the day, it’s hard to imagine multiples retracing their previous highs. Rather than facing a down-round, companies may pre-emptively reprice. Imagine a startup raises at $5b and then reprices its RSUs to imply a $3b valuation. It could then raise its next round at $4b and consider it an up-round. Benjamin Graham, the father of modern investing, wrote in Security Analysis “In the short-run, the stock market is a voting machine. Yet, in the long-run, it’s a weighing machine.” Valuations of companies may move up and down based on the whims of the market - hot money, interest rates, M&A, IPOs. In the end, great companies will always be valuable, irrespective of the bumps and turbulence along the way.

What’s the price of spice ? If you’ve never seen a data app, that’s the question you should be asking yourself.  Data apps are living documents that weave narratives around data and charts to explain, persuade, or empower. Imagine your future self. You work for a large company selling spices and you’re tasked with exploring the impact of pricing changes. Most importantly, you’ll present the results to executives who will no doubt pepper you with questions about what-ifs. You toss aside the presentation software, opting instead for a data notebook because this won’t be the last time you’ll be asked to analyze prices. With a notebook, you’ll be able to reuse your work. First, you plot the historical revenues of the company on the Imperial Market: $189B solari is no small amount of spice. Revenues are flattish though. Next, you unmask the reason for the tepid growth: prices have been static for the past six months or so, even though high-value customers transact just as frequently as smaller spice buyers. You anticipate the CFO will ask questions about a particular customer or two, to test the integrity of the data. No problem. Type in any customer name into this section of the app to plot historical purchasing behavior. This customer’s pricing is clearly suboptimal. Last, you decide to write a series of simple models to gauge revenue impact if the business varies cost and price increases. Now, you’re prepared. You share the app ahead of the meeting to pre-brief the key stakeholders. This workflow is why data apps are the future. They meld the best attributes of collaborative documents, familiar web interfaces, and repeatable data analysis. I embedded screenshots of the What’s the Price of Spice app, but play around with it and you’ll understand the magic immediately. If you’d prefer to watch someone walk through it, check out the 4 min intro here. ]( https://static.hex.site/building-in-hex.mp4 ) Today, Hex announced their $52m Series B , an important milestone for the company leading the data apps movement. Congratulations to the team. If you’re interested in building software that empowers the next generation of spice analysts and all technical analysts, join Hex.

Six months ago, I wrote about how the cap tables of crypto companies have approached the structure of web2 startups . Recently, EVMOS , a web3 project, pushed forward an important innovation for the web3 ecosystem. EVMOS enables Ethereum’s virtual machine on the Cosmos chain. The EVMOS token model innovates on its predecessors by introducing the App Store dynamics to web3. In Apple’s app store, users pay Apple to access apps and developers receive a revenue share. This doesn’t happen today in web3. Except on EVMOS. When users pay gas fees (transaction fees) to use EVMOS, 50% accrue to developers building applications. The other 50% rewards validators. Governance token holders may vote to change the 50/50 split in the future. Gas sharing rewards developers for writing popular applications on EVMOS. Developer evangelism underpins healthy L1 chains: without applications, the underlying database of much value, no matter how sophisticated the technology. A stadium without entertainment sells no tickets. Historically, web3 companies have paid developers fees from their treasuries or dedicated ecosystem funds to build applications atop chains. While this technique may achieve the same results initially, developers may not stick around after the check hits the bank (or the tokens appear in their wallet). The EVMOS model better aligns current and future incentives of the L1 and the developers. In addition, ecosystem development is no longer a series of one-time expenses for the treasury, but an ongoing shared cost. To make the math work, the EVMOS token model reduces initial community ownership to 10%, which furthers the compressive trend observed late last year. The EVMOS token model may be one of the most influential innovations in web3 developer relations in a long time. After all, this concept has dominated the mobile app ecosystem and powered Apple and Google’s multi-billion dollar revenue streams from app stores. Web3 finds itself at a moment where the innovations in infrastructure have outpaced those in applications. To attract the next billion users to web3, the great pendulum of technology progress must swing towards applications. The EVMOS app store model might be the insight to compel tens of thousands more developers to swallow the web3 red pill.

Is charging by consumption (usage-based pricing) a superior model for a business?  When we say UBP, we mean charging customers by how much they use, rather than a constant amount of seats per month or API calls per month. On on hand, UBP lubricates the customer conversion funnel. Prospects sign up and grow their accounts seamlessly. Usage data feeds the PLG lead score , and AEs outbound to the most promising users. Customers expand as their needs dictate and customer segments fall out from usage data On the other hand, customers may be frustrated to estimate how much of a product they’ll use and the surprise of overage charges. Separately, the startup may have to reinvent its GTM: new AE quotas, sales materials, margin calculations. These three questions may help guide a startup to the best answer: Is my startup selling an application or infrastructure? Application software companies sell seats. Infrastructure companies sell API calls, licenses per core or host, SMSs, bandwidth, storage by the GB. Salesforce largely set the standard for selling application seats. Most of the time, application software companies don’t sell seats via UBP. Slack is a notable exception. Selling constant seat counts stems from the perception that the number of people using software shouldn’t change that much from one month to the next for most software. The predictability of fixed costs outweighs the benefits of flexibility. Infrastructure usage can vary widely depending on seasonality (retail traffic spikes in Q4), developer activity (migration from one architecture to the next), new product launches, amongst other factors. Selling UBP to a buyer accustomed to buying a flat seat count introduces more friction into the sales process. Often, the effort probably isn’t worth it, unless the company’s stated strategy is to differentiate on price structure. What should my unit of pricing be? The goal of UBP is to align the cost of software with the value.  The unit of pricing is the crux to unlocking that puzzle. The unit must be easy for a customer to understand, simple to predict, and crystal-clear so there aren’t arguments on what a unit is or isn’t in the future. Company Product Unit Pricing AppDynamics APM CPU Core $6 / core / month ScoutAPM APM API Call $1 / API call / month Lightstep APM Service $85 / service / month Instana APM Host $75 / host / month Splunk APM Host $55 / host / month DataDog APM Host $31 / host / month Aligning on a particular unit isn’t easy. Within the same space, companies have different takes. Here’s a table of the usage-based pricing schemes of Application Performance Monitoring (APM) companies’ that I put together from scanning each business’s pricing page.  There are four different units across these six companies. Having varying units might be an advantage: it’s harder for customers to price discriminate. How many API calls per host or services per host is the same as $31 per host per month? But it might confuse the customer who’s accustomed /ato buying the service in a different way. Is your startup differentiating on pricing to compete with an incumbent? Or are selling a superior product at a premium in which case using the same pricing model with higher fees reinforces the brand? Can this pricing model achieve certain boundary pricing conditions? How much should a Fortune 500 bank pay for your startup? How about a 50 person SaaS company? The UBP pricing scheme needs to satisfy these boundary conditions: a certain customer ought to pay a certain amount in order for the business to succeed. Often, a straight UBP pricing model doesn’t scale into the enterprise. A F500 may not consume enough units to justify a $250k or $2m deal. Introducing pricing layers on the unit of pricing can remedy this challenge. Basic units cost $1. Units that are HIPAA compliant cost 3x as much and FINRA compliant is one dollar more per unit. Sometimes, companies add a second part to the UBP model: the platform fee, which makes the UBP a 2-part tariff . The platform fee instant boosts the ACV ad can be tailored per customer segment One other thought on UBP. Some customers fear the sticker shock of dramatic usage in the first billing period. To offset this risk, many sales teams cap the charge in the first billing period to ensure customers who sign up and use substantially more of a service don’t suffer sticker shock when the first bill arrives. Thanks to Barry McCardel for the inspiration on this post.

Thanks to the many readers who wrote in to Guess the Startup on Friday. There were a torrent of ideas: Mongo, Twilio, Snowflake, Databricks, Niantic, Klayvio, Microsoft, DataStax, Zoom, and Peloton. Here’s the early revenue chart again. Blue Company is none other than MongoDB, one of the most successful standalone database companies. Red Company is Ethereum. To the many people who guessed correctly, congratulations! I’m impressed by your knowledge of the tech landscape. I had three goals for the Guess the Startup Post. First, to have a bit of fun on a Friday. Second, to show that database companies across web2/web3 can trade at similar multiples, which was a surprise to me. After all, MongoDB and Ethereum are vastly different entities for many reasons. they trade on separate exchanges they offer different ownership instruments: ETH tokens vs MDB equity they employ dissimilar go-to-markets: Ethereum has no enterprise sales team but MongoDB certainly does their business predictability diverges wildly: Mongo reports bookings, net dollar retention, customers worth more than 100k in contract value. Try finding those metrics for Ethereum. We’ll have to see how these two companies trade relative to each other in the future, but they’re closer today than I would have expected. Over time, these companies’ multiples may move together. After all, an investor looking to buy the best database investment will have to choose between Ethereum and Mongo (amongst others). So inevitably, investors will compare web2 and web3. But, there are many questions to answer about the differences between equity and tokens before the valuation multiples across these two categories reach a consensus. Third, to highlight the revenue growth of web3 vis-a-vis web2, and the value creation possible. At $310b, Ethereum’s market cap is more than 15x Mongo’s market cap. But about a year ago, the revenues of both businesses were identical (see above). A 16.6x growth rate in a year would be the envy of most seed stage startups. It’s truly unprecedented at the scale of hundreds of millions of revenue. Both Mongo and Ethereum are phenomenal businesses, each achieving a unique position in their market in different ways.

I’m going to tell you a bit about two startups and I’d like you to guess the name of each company. Both of these businesses are publicly traded. Both startups provide database software to developers to build applications. Both have grown very fast. In fact, their revenue trajectories through 2020 are nearly identical. Both companies employ a usage-based pricing model: pay for what you use. In 2016, each company recorded less than $50m in revenue. In two years, both would near $200m in revenue. They would both exceed $400m in 2020. Both of these businesses trade at similar valuations as of this writing. Red Company Blue Company Market Cap to Revenue Multiple 32.6 32.2 But the stories diverge in 2021. Red Company’s revenue explodes from $595m to $9.9b. That’s 16.6x growth, a rate most seed stage companies would struggle to match. Who is Red Company and who is Blue Company? Message me on Twitter with your answer . I’ll share the answers on Monday. Part 2: 2022-03-14 Thanks to the many readers who wrote in to Guess the Startup on Friday. There were a torrent of ideas: Mongo, Twilio, Snowflake, Databricks, Niantic, Klayvio, Microsoft, DataStax, Zoom, and Peloton. Here’s the early revenue chart again. Blue Company is none other than MongoDB, one of the most successful standalone database companies. Red Company is Ethereum. To the many people who guessed correctly, congratulations! I’m impressed by your knowledge of the tech landscape. I had three goals for the Guess the Startup Post. First, to have a bit of fun on a Friday. Second, to show that database companies across web2/web3 can trade at similar multiples, which was a surprise to me. After all, MongoDB and Ethereum are vastly different entities for many reasons. they trade on separate exchanges they offer different ownership instruments: ETH tokens vs MDB equity they employ dissimilar go-to-markets: Ethereum has no enterprise sales team but MongoDB certainly does their business predictability diverges wildly: Mongo reports bookings, net dollar retention, customers worth more than 100k in contract value. Try finding those metrics for Ethereum. We’ll have to see how these two companies trade relative to each other in the future, but they’re closer today than I would have expected. Over time, these companies’ multiples may move together. After all, an investor looking to buy the best database investment will have to choose between Ethereum and Mongo (amongst others). So inevitably, investors will compare web2 and web3. But, there are many questions to answer about the differences between equity and tokens before the valuation multiples across these two categories reach a consensus. Third, to highlight the revenue growth of web3 vis-a-vis web2, and the value creation possible. At $310b, Ethereum’s market cap is more than 15x Mongo’s market cap. But about a year ago, the revenues of both businesses were identical (see above). A 16.6x growth rate in a year would be the envy of most seed stage startups. It’s truly unprecedented at the scale of hundreds of millions of revenue. Both Mongo and Ethereum are phenomenal businesses, each achieving a unique position in their market in different ways.

A decade ago, Gainsight championed the creation of the customer success category. People curious and passionate about customer success convened at the Pulse conference to debate customer success.  In 2013 and 2015, the discipline’s merits dominated the conversation. Soon thereafter, the most common question became how to build and run a CS team, replacing why start a CS team. Ten years hence, customer success continues to evolve. Today, practitioners have segmented themselves into three types of teams. The chart above is my mental model for modern customer success teams. The y-axis spans the average contract value (ACV) from $1k to 150k+. The x-axis covers the sales motion from self-serve, to sales-assisted in the center, to complex deployments. Self-serve small ACV companies have developed the hybrid CSAM role ( customer success account managers). Ideal for freemium low-ACV startups and some PLG-motions , CSAMs shoulder the responsibility of both technical support and account expansion. Users sign up, use the product, raise questions, and at some point raise their hands with an American Express ready to swipe it. CSAMs handle it all. Mid-market companies with moderate sales involvement and configuration surround the customer with three people. First, the account executive closes the sale, then transfers the relationship to the CSM for retention and expansion. The customer support team tackles the technical questions. This is the classical customer success team structure. Higher ACV and complex deployment businesses have experimented with 4 people surrounding an account: the AE, SE (sales engineer) who implements and configures the software for a customer, the support team, and a customer success manager. Of late, enterprise startups have trimmed the CS function, reducing the team size to three. Notably, Frank Slootman re-architected Snowflake’s go-to-market organization this way. He writes in Amp It Up : “If you have a customer success department, that gives everyone else an incentive to stop worrying about how well our customers are thriving with our products and services…this had the effect that the other departments sat back, became more passive, and felt less ownership of customer success (p 100).” AEs targeting larger accounts most often close a single department first. Expanding from this team to another requires a subsequent sales process. Blanketing the buyer with an SLA requires yet another sales process - the domain of the sales team. Account executives are better suited to this task than the typical CSM. Plus, the ultimate value of enterprise accounts often exceed $1m ARR. Such a prize justifies an AE’s ongoing focus on expansion and enables the AE to attain quota of 1.2m to 1.6m in ACV per year when managing a handful of these accounts. Last, this structure reduces the startup’s costs assuming the customers as satisfied as before. This segmentation is a rough mental model and exceptions abound, especially when companies sell across segments. A startup might use two or three of these models to serve customers of different sizes through various sales motions.

Startups create products. After product-market fit, product teams hew the product roadmap from a panoply of options to the features best aligned with the company’s plans. In much the same way, CEOs architect the organization that builds, markets, sells, and supports the product. When a business is ready to scale, a startup ought to develop an organizational roadmap. These roadmaps chart the growth of each organization within the business. This schematic depicts a common structure for a marketing team at a later-stage company. A CMO manages the organization. Two lieutenants, a head of product marketing and a head of demand generation, enlist teams of various specialties. The customer lifecycle team, product marketing team, and content team report to the head of product marketing. Other marketing disciplines are important - analyst relations, for example, but I’ve omitted them for simplicity. The demand generation function is structured similarly. Managers of paid acquisition, organic acquisition, and marketing operations/systems report to the head of demand generation. The question for early-stage startups is how to start building this structure. Who should be the first marketing hire ? Most startups begin either with a product marketer or a demand generation specialist. Given the tightness of the labor market, the first hire is often market-driven: who’s available? In many Series A and B companies, the early marketing organization numbers three people: a product marketer, a content person, and a demand generation specialist. As the company scales, the heads of demand generation and product marketing join the team. Some teams wait to staff these leaders, preferring to employ individual contributors first.  Hiring doers first means more immediate impact to the organization with less initial investment, perhaps betting the initial recruit grows into the management role. Other startups begin by hiring leaders first and thereby benefit from an additional hiring manager on the team recruiting from a new network . Early companies face challenges recruiting leaders because of the demand for high-performing leaders, who themselves may prefer to join a startup after the company achieves certain milestones. Understanding how a startup’s team will evolve over time helps an organization plan its recruiting efforts, take advantage of opportunistic hires, and budget for the future.

The Future of Money provides a sweeping landscape of how money is changing. Paper money is an 800 year-old institution implemented by Kublai Khan grandson of Ghengis Khan, and founder of the Yuan Dynasty. After nearly a millennium, bills and coins’ time may be ebbing. Sweden projects the end of paper money, amongst its citizens by 2030. Today, 87% of Swedes never use cash for transactions. What will replace paper money? In the future, central banks may mint Central Bank Digital Coins (CBDCs). Sweden has experimented with the eKronor, the Swedish CBDC, since 2020. The Swedes aren’t the only ones to pursue CBDCs. The Bahamas mints the Sand Dollar. China is developing the e-yuan. Ecuador, Uruguay, Tunisia, the US and others are experimenting or exploring CBDCs. CBDCs may be the future of monetary policy, enabling governments to mint and destroy money through software. Imagine a reserve bank stimulating the electric bicycle industry in the Kansas City metropolitan area by providing residents new US dollars that are only valid within bike shops in Kansas City. Digital dollars provide significantly more transparency to governments. Central bankers would swim through the most accurate ocean of economic data possible. Of course, more transparency risks increasing surveillance. Will citizens accept this trade? It’s a question that electorates and leaders will need to answer in the coming decade. Crypto’s influence on the future of money threads its theme throughout the book’s chapters. But the decentralized ledger may not. DLT, which Bitcoin brought to mass adoption, records financial transactions without needing to trust counterparties. But not everyone building modern crypto applications employs DLTs. For example, Chinese e-yuan transactions are recorded in a centralized database. Crypto encompasses many ideas: DLTs, digital money, privacy, new financial instruments, trustless interactions, and many more. The potential for innovation from these ideas, their combinations, and their descendants is hard to overstate. If you’re looking to understand how money moves across banks with SWIFT or how money moves across borders from Omaha to Ouagadougou through correspondent banks or how changes to these systems impact geopolitics, the Future of Money is your ticket.

Distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs) are one of the most vibrant areas of crypto. DAOs are groups of people with the right to vote to change how a crypto company operates. DAOs pop up for many different reasons: to form a social club that requires a token to join, to buy a copy of the Constitution , to manage open source software. Almost any group of people can organize a DAO to pursue a shared purpose. Anyone holding a voting token can vote, much like anyone who buys a share of voting stock in a public company can vote during a shareholder meeting. But DAO culture is unique. It’s no boardroom. The vibe is more Github, less Goldman. Within DAO forums, token-holders propose ideas. Any member of the DAO can suggest a proposal, which members debate then ratify or  strike-down. A proposal may advocate altering the roadmap (evolve from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake); or distributing some funds from the company’s treasury (as a dividend or to pay a vendor for a service); or advocate changes voting rules, among many other things. To get a feel for these types of conversations, visit Uniswap’s DAO . DeepDAO , a provider of data on DAOs, counts more than 4000 DAOs with more than 0.5m active voters.[1] By examining the behavior of the top 20 most valuable DAOs, we can see some patterns emerge. First, DAO populations follow a power law. ENS ( Ethereum Name Service ), which sells usernames for people and names for wallets, manages the largest of these DAOs with more than 95,000 active members who have cast 98.6k votes across 15 different proposals. In contrast, Radicle counts 68 active members for a DAO worth $249m who have cast 76 votes across 5 proposals, according to the DeepDao data. Second, there seem to be at least two clusters DAO types by activity rate. Those with high member participation rates and those with very low participation rates. This behavior seems to be scale-free or independent of size. ENS has more than 100,000 members and nearly 100% of them are active. Aave has a similar size voter base but the opposite level of activity. OlympusDAO and Ribbon break the mold with relatively large voting populations a moderate rate of activity at 25%. What’s best? It depends on the goals of the DAO. A social club might seek maximum participation. A highly technical Defi protocol may prefer a coterie of experts to shepherd its direction. Some DAOs see many proposals. Decentraland, a 3D virtual world, counts more than one thousand; while others’ ballots number in the single digits. One of the key responsibilities of DAO founders will be determining how they prefer their community to behave, what norms they will seek to encourage. Setting those early will be key to the success of the DAO. I suspect 1/9/90 heuristic - 1% of the population creates, 9% comments, and the remaining 90% lurk -  will emerge as the dominant pattern. This rule seems to govern most social networks today and DAOs are another form of social network - one with hundreds of millions of dollars behind them. DAOs hold the promise to a new way to organize people with a shared interest in project or purpose. We should expect some of the same behaviors in existing social networks to arise within DAOs, and some entirely new ones enabled by large treasuries and the voting construct that enables self-determination. [1] DeepDAO is in alpha so there’s likely to be some tightening up of the numbers as the company progresses. [2] Active rates are noisy because voters can provide their votes to a protocol proxy, who votes on their behalf.

Microservices has become the default architecture for many companies. By breaking down large codebases into smaller pieces, microservices empower engineers to ship code faster. Continuous integration, the process of constantly folding new code into production (live on the website or service), further accelerates the software velocity. There’s a cost to this speed: coordination.  Engineers developing microservices work with the ground shifting underneath them all the time. An engineer building a new microservice that enables up-selling customers relies on other software written by teammates.  The upsell service might use three services: customer identity, billing, and feature flags to update the CRM with an upsell, increase billing, and flip on the new features using LaunchDarkly. During the course of a day or week, any of those three dependencies might evolve and break the upsell microservice. Each team operates relatively independently.  Because the upsell microservice is under development, no regression tests exist to ensure changes don’t break the upsell functionality. The ideal solution is to develop in production, but developing in production is risky. An engineer might delete customer data or unwittingly interfere with other bits of the codebase. Signadot enables developers to code in production safely. Signadot enables engineers to write microservices code in production while isolating the network and the database - sandboxing the microservice. This is the best of both worlds. The upsell microservice uses the latest code from peers and the core infrastructure is safe. Most saliently, Signadot is founded by a cloud-native team. Arjun & Anirudh, the co-founders of Signadot have deep infrastructure experience. Arjun was the Senior Director of Engineering at AppDynamics and grew the BusinessIQ division to $100m in ARR, and Anirudh is a key contributor to Kubernetes. Signadot sandboxes are lightweight and  Kube-native. They don’t require retooling the code or the infrastructure the way other solutions might, which means sandboxes can be adopted quickly and easily. We’re thrilled to partner with Signadot. The company is growing quickly and looking to hire people passionate to build the next layer in the shift-left movement,

Will year-end Series A and B valuations top or trail those of January? This question sits atop most founders’ lips and boardroom agendas. The broad market sentiment is they will be lower. Public-market software valuations have withered more than 60% from their highs. Alarm about interest rates, QE ending, and geopolitical risk have swirled around public technology companies, kinking the valuation curve . Amidst this gloomy backdrop, The Information published a story on hedge funds’ strategy shift. Instead of late-stage opportunities, they’ll be focusing on early-stage venture in 2022. If true, Series A and B markets may surge upward against the countervailing depressive momentum. Hedge funds’s big chip stacks have become a market force in venture during the last three years. PitchBook surmises non-traditional VC (aka hot money) comprises 78% of venture dollars invested in 2021. Across Series A to Series E rounds in the US, hedge funds participated in 63% of startup financings worth more than $200B in 2021. That figure didn’t crest $4b ten years ago. Though some hedge funds index the market, they haven’t indexed it by stage. 2021 marked a near universal strategic focus on Series C, D, and E rounds. Hedge funds appeared on the cap table in more than 35% of Series C, D, and E rounds in the US. In contrast, these investors wholly disregarded Series As and Bs. A paltry 1.3% of Series As and Bs received hedge fund money - effectively zero. Should this investor cadre focus earlier, we should expect the red and blue lines to reverse course, and suddenly. But by how much? The surge of hedge fund capital into Series C-E investing boosted median pre-money valuations 150% in 2021. Causation is hard to prove, but correlation, its weaker brother, suggests these dollars influenced the market quite a bit. Hedge fund activity correlates at 0.95 with mid-stage valuations, explaining 90% of the variance. Last year, early stage prices expanded by half without the benefit of hedge-fund money. Deep stacks entering the early market will pressure valuations more because the early market is one-third the size of the Series C-E market. Founder preferences may differ at the early stage than the growth stage. The value propositions of board seats, venture platforms for hiring, business development, & marketing, and more active investing will be tested in 2022. Hedge fund flows into early venture will challenge the market’s bearish disposition and define pricing dynamics in 2022. Whether positive or negative pricing momentum will prevail is hard to predict. But the answer isn’t as simple as it was a few weeks ago.

The most consistent sales leader I’ve worked with hit plan 27 consecutive quarters. How can a sales leader develop similar repeatability? Much goes into it here are the reports he used to manage his team at the board level. The PQR (pipeline-to-quota) funnel is first. Pipeline is the total value of the accounts within a stage or later. Quota is the aggregate quota on the street for the quarter. Divide P by Q to get PQR. This hypothetical startup amassed 2.3x PQR at Stage 3+. This team is off to a good start with 0.7x of the quarter’s number in Stage 5+ at the beginning of a quarter. Each business’s PQR funnel will differ depending on their sales cycle, ACVs, and overall motion. For stage definitions, see [1]. Will the sales leader attain plan? It depends on the sales cycle of the product. If the sales cycle lasts 45 days, the startup has time to move Stage 2 opportunities to Stage 6 before quarter end. If the sales cycle is 120 days, well…it’s going to take some heroics or heavy discounts. Looking at the quarter in isolation is useful, but longitudinal tracking provides more insight into future performance. Hence, the longitudinal PQL report. From this report, we glean the top of the funnel is exceptionally strong, but the conversion of that funnel into meetings fell steeply, from 3 to 2.4x. Why? Because Stage 3 leads move quickly to Stage 4 proposal, rather than spending time in meetings (spike in green line). We should cross-check if this squares with a drop in sales cycle for the period. The startup starts the quarter with 70% of the target bookings in late-stage conversations. That’s a promising start and the data suggests the team will perform similarly this quarter to previous quarters. Now onto the bottoms-up analysis. Summing the estimates from each sales manager provides a different lens. Like the tops-down math, the aggregate sales manager forecast confirms the sales team has chalked up 74% of the number for the quarter in late-stage. If the chips fall the right way, the AEs may achieve 176% of its number, subject to sales cycles. For stage definitions, see [2]. Comparing the blue lines, we see sales managers’ estimates are more conservative than the top-down figure. In my experience, the bottoms-up figures tend to be more accurate. The last step is to track the conversion rates of leads from different stages to close. Most of the time, these conversion rates remain relatively steady, especially as a startup scales. Assuming this is the case, these reports suffice to assess the health of a pipeline and the probability the company will hit its number. By charting the longitudinal PQR ratio top-down and bottom-up, a sales leader can identify when a sales team will attain plan and which parts of the funnel differ in performance from quarter-to-quarter. In between these two estimates likely lies the ultimate performance of the business. Definitions [1] Salesforce defines the stages of a deal as: Prospecting: discover an account Lead qualification: could the account be a fit? Demo/meeting: sales meeting Proposal: send over terms Negotiation: discuss how to do business Opportunity won: signed contract [2] The terminology here differs from above Won is a signed deal Forecast are accounts that the managers expect to close Upside are accounts that may close in the quarter but have enough risk in the process timing or decision that the team shouldn’t count on them

Over the last few years, I’ve been lucky to work with founders and management teams to sell about $5b of startups. During that time, I’ve observed a few things about M&A. Here are 10 of my learnings: Most acquirers have built a relationship with the acquisition target. Suitors introduced during a sale process wrestle with doubts of understanding what they don’t know about the space, the team, and the business. Leaders should build relationships with partners and potential buyers if M&A may be in the company’s future. Startups are sold to individuals, not to companies. The champion - often a product leader, the CEO, or a general manager - risks their career by buying a startup. The deal sponsor must construct a business case, forge trust with the startup’s team, and amass enough conviction to overcome inertia and internal friction to consummate the sale. Be wary of first-time acquirers. They may lack the internal know-how to complete a transaction. Acquisitions require significant cross-functional alignment. Mustering consensus can be problematic during the ordinary course of business, and it’s even more challenging under duress. The deal isn’t done until the money is in the bank. I’ve seen acquisitions fall apart the day of close, out of the blue. There are three types of sales: team, team & tech, and team, tech, & traction. Each one is more valuable than the last, provided the company grows. The greater the revenue, the more likely the acquirer prices a target on a revenue multiple. Should a management team and board decide to sell, they should understand the buyer’s motivation. As Simon Sinek would say, start with the why. It will inform how to weave the most compelling vision of a union. The startup can exert maximum leverage immediately before signing the term sheet. Once the term sheet is signed, the startup’s leverage vaporizes. The startup must plod through the days or months of maximum weakness: the exclusivity period between the term sheet signing and the definitive agreement. Negotiate the crucial points before signing the term sheet. The essential components of a merger term sheet often include: price: the amount and the structure (cash vs stock; merger or asset purchase) executive compensation: especially equity revesting escrow terms: percent of the consideration in escrow, length the escrow, insurance net-working capital: is the purchase price cash-free/debt-free? no-shop period: how long is the exclusivity? fundamental representations and warranties: the key assertions the target makes about itself and its business. Best to talk to your friendly company counsel on this one. break-up fee: if the transaction is large enough to warrant one Regulatory delays have become more common recently when selling to a large technology company. Most mergers close on time. But should a transaction be subject to review by the US, the EU, the UK, or other jurisdictions, the closing period can take many months, a year, or longer. Referencing a buyer paints a picture of the company and teams’ future post-sale. How does the acquirer integrate a company? Treat founders throughout their vesting period? What will it be like to work there next year? Sales processes are convoluted and complex. There are some parallels to raising capital in that success rates improve by building auction pressure . But the mananging the nuances are critical should you decide to pursue a merger.

In 1968, Milton Friedman argued “ In the Price of Money, ” that higher interest rates don’t mean less borrowing. He would echo this sentiment in an article Reviving Japan . “After the U.S. experience during the Great Depression, and after inflation and rising interest rates in the 1970s and disinflation and falling interest rates in the 1980s, I thought the fallacy of identifying tight money with high-interest rates and easy money with low-interest rates was dead. Apparently, old fallacies never die.” Is this true in venture capital? As the Fed raises rates in the next few quarters, will startups borrow less? We’ve established that interest rates are uncorrelated to startup financing over the last twenty years. But what about debt? Over the last ten years, venture debt correlates well with interest rates. At -0.5 correlation, interest rates explain about one quarter of changes in the venture debt dollars raised. The more expensive debt, the less of it startups seek. This goes against Friedman’s view. What about the ratio of debt to equity? Irrespective of the environment, debt is always less expensive than equity because it’s far less dilutive.  Given the low-interest rate environment, have startups shifted their share of dollars from equity to debt? The ratio remains steadfast, hovering around 2% venture debt/equity dollars over the last decade. This affirms Friedman’s Fallacy. Rates and venture debt/equity ratio bears no correlation to rates. In short, interest rates do influence how much debt startups seek in aggregate, but the ratio of debt/equity for each startups is relatively constant throughout time. At least according to this data, Friedman’s Fallacy applies at the macro-level, but not at the micro-level.

Suppose you launch a web3 company tomorrow. The business builds software to help other crypto companies grow. Perhaps you’ll sell infrastructure to help other startups scale or software to manage internal operations. After you’ve launched the product, you’ll encounter a new phenomenon. Your customers prefer to pay you in crypto. Fast forward three years, your business thrives. The customer roster brims with the best names, each client increases their spend every year, and the sales team outpaces its quota handsomely. You decide to pull up your balance sheet. You have $20m in dollars and $40m in tokens of various flavors. The token balance fluctuates quite a bit. Some months, that $40m is $80m; others, it’s $20m. You wonder, how do I best manage these tokens for the business? Most US web2 software companies might progress through their lifespans without ever uttering the words treasury management in a board meeting. Abroad, the story differs. When a startup sells software to users outside their home country and receives payment in foreign currencies, they must manage foreign-exchange risk. B2B web3 companies will need to manage their treasuries from the very first few customer contracts because there are consequential questions to answer from day one. First, does the startup retain tokens or immediately swap them for dollars? By hodling, the business implicitly operates a hedge fund. Keeping tokens means taking a constructive/long view on those tokens and selling vice-versa. How should the company decide which tokens to hold and which to swap? Should the business hire a full-time analyst to manage this balance sheet question? Second, if the business keeps the tokens, the company bears some tax risk. Imagine your top account executive books a $5m USD contract paid in tokens. The business pays 20% tax annually which implies a $1m tax liability on the tokens. In the subsequent two quarters, the token’s price collapses by 95%, so the $5m is now worth $0.25m. Signing the customer contract costs the company $750k, excluding the sales commission. Of course, the treasury could swell if the token were to appreciate
significantly. Third, how will your business manage payments and accounts receivable? A big bill comes due and the company can opt to pay in dollars or crypto. It might be monthly payroll. Which option is better: tokens or dollars? These are just some of the questions web3 software companies face as they begin to scale. Treasury management will become an essential function even at the early stages for most web3 software businesses.

If I gave you $10,000 to invest in one company today among the following four software businesses, which would you pick? Company Growth Rate ARR Multiple (ARR/EV) 1 100% 100 50x 2 125% 950 25x 3 71% 2800 20x 4 65% 2960 10.5x The first company is a $100m ARR business growing at 100%, trading at 50x ARR, a $5b enterprise value. The fourth company grows 65% on $7b in ARR, implying a $29b EV. Which investment will generate the greatest return? This is the question facing late-stage software investors today. Some might choose company 1: the high-flyer with the richest multiple. Others might choose Company 2. Company 2 compounds revenue at 83% the rate of company 1, but at half the price. Value-oriented investors may opt for company 4. The revenue trajectory mirrors company 3 at one-half the price. So who are these businesses? The first company isn’t a company but a composite of where the private markets traded at the end of 2021. Company 2 is Bill.com, Company 3 is Shopify, and Company 4 is Twilio. Two valuation kinks pop out from the table. The first lies between company 1 and company 2. Should a company growing 13% slower at smaller ARR than another fetch twice the multiple? The second discontinuity is between companies 3 and 4 who chart nearly identical growth rates but whose multiples differ by 79%. The rapid halving of software multiples has disjointed the valuations between public and private companies, and between growth and value companies. Venture investing clocked more than $329b invested last year , up 10x since 2010. Of that $329b, $253b (77%) originated from the wallets of non-traditional investors: hedge funds, crossovers, private equity, sovereign wealth, and mutual funds. If these late-stage investors shift focus to public markets seeking investments valued at lower multiples resulting from the discontinuity, capital might fly from the venture market. Nine digits of hot money rushed into venture in the last two years, doubling prices. The next few quarters may reveal what happens when these funds surge elsewhere. – Notes: this post compares multiples across four companies which have different markets, business models, and margin structures. I chose them to be illustrative of a broader point rather than an expansive market view. I hold positions in Shopify and Twilio.

I remember the first time I spoke with Frank Slootman. Beforehand, I read his book Tape Sucks , watched some of his videos on YouTube, and read his blog posts. After few minutes, I couldn’t deny his unique passion for growth and scale. I called him on a Sunday in the summer. Frank told me most companies don’t focus enough; that there’s only one priority for him: growth. He said if he were to join a startup’s board he would push the business very hard - very, very hard. The company and the board needed to sign up for exactly that. Each sentence he uttered felt like a bullet and I was dancing. On the other end of the phone, he was relaxing aboard a yacht that had won a major race. Frank’s new book Amp It Up evoked the same feeling as our conversation. The book is part personal history, part management philosophy, all intensity. In a section called “Hire Drivers, Not Passengers and Get the Wrong People Off the Bus,” which talks about employees either taking ownership of projects with ambition and energy (drivers) or passengers who are largely dead weight because they don’t mind being carried along by momentum, he writes: “Whenever I bring up this notion of drivers vs passengers at an all-hands meeting, I can see it makes some people uncomfortable…At one such meeting, an engineer raised his hand during the Q&A session and asked innocently: ‘How do I know if I’m a passenger or a driver?’ My flippant answer was that he’d better figure it out before I did.” In another section, Slootman writes. “Leaders set the pace. People sometimes ask to get back to me in a week, and I ask, why not tomorrow or the next day?” The book champions the idea of accelerating execution pace. In fact, it argues great execution is rarer than great strategy. Instead of telling people what I think of a proposal, a product, a feature, whatever, I ask them instead what they think. Were they thrilled with it? Absolutely love it? Most of the time I would hear “It’s okay,” or “It’s not bad.” Those three examples capture some of the forceful drive in Amp It Up. But the book is more than another take on leadership in the style of Navy Seals lieutenant commander and instructor Jocko Willink . Embedded in the book are contrarian perspectives on the role of customer success within a team; the proper way to incentivize a sales team with usage-based billing; and how management meetings skip a critical step in decision-making. Amp It Up oozes intensity, a belligerent desire to win, and absolute ambition. No more credible person could deliver such a message than a CEO who has led three of the most iconic companies to massive success in the last 20 years.

How much money flows into crypto each month? There’s the headline figure $1.7T which is the aggregate market cap of crypto. But how about the volumes of US dollars being exchanged into crypto each month? Sometimes this is called fund flows. I’ve learned calculating this figure is tricky because there’s no centralized reporting for it. But we can get a sense of it via stablecoin minting patterns. Stablecoins are tokens that are backed by a fiat currency. Each time a marginal dollar buys a stablecoin, a new stablecoin must be minted. Sometimes these stablecoins are burned (destroyed). The net amount of stablecoin creation over time should provide us a directional sense of dollar flow. For this analysis, I’m looking at Ethereum based stablecoins since 2020 by month. Over the past two years, stablecoin value increased from a few billion to more than $114b. The summer of 2021 witnessed the steepest growth from $35b to nearly $70b. Since then, stablecoin net minting has doubled. This chart shows the monthly growth rate of stablecoins, by quarter. In the first quarter of 2020, the typical net minting rate reached 32% per month. In the most recent quarter, the figure is at 5%. That 5% compounded over twelve months implies an 80% growth rate per year for a $114b asset class. Pretty impressive. The total US money supply, which includes physical cash, traveler’s checks, deposits, and all other forms of money has surged to about $20.5T . If stablecoins continue their 5% monthly growth for the next 12 months, they would comprise 1% of the total US dollar money supply. This analysis is a back-of-the-envelope assessment of stablecoin creation, not a precise attestation. Very roughly, it’s about $5b per month, growing at 5% per month. – Total stablecoin value reported in CoinGecko, TokenTerminal and others will reflect a value of about $177b. The numbers above only include Ethereum based stablecoins. For example, Tether has $77b its stablecoin extant, but 50% resides on Tron . This analysis ignores other stablecoin/currency pairs (eg, GBP, JPY) Thanks to Fredrik of Dune for helping me with this analysis.

Pocus and First Round Capital published the 2021 Product-Led Sales (PLS) report earlier this week . Product-Led Growth (PLG) and PLS are important advances in SaaS growth that have existed for a while , but are coming to the fore more recently because startups who master PLG/PLS enjoy terrifically capital efficient growth because technology supplies leads rather than human effort. PLG/PLS motions typically couple three things: Free-trial/freemium product to attract a large top of funnel (TOFU) Product analytics to monitor prospects through their customer journey in the middle of the funnel (MOFU), and predict the best time to contact the user to sell them, at which point they are product-qualified leads (PQL). Sales-assisted close to maximize the conversion rate (yep, you guessed it - BOFU). The Pocus/FRC survey highlights three revealing developments in the SaaS landscape. First, every company will become PLG, just as every SaaS company has sales-led growth and marketing-led growth. 55% of PLG companies have a sales team. Another 43% of respondents have either classic growth or PLG and will add the complement soon. After all, what business wouldn’t want to adopt a new, efficient customer acquisition channel? Second, account executive engagement of PQLs varies quite a bit. 36% of companies call after a sign-up; 48% after the PQL algorithm declares potential; and 62% after the user asks for it.  I would have thought the 62% would be much higher. If a prospect raises their hand, it’s probably a good time to talk about upgrading.  Regardless, the PQL-conversion rate should inform AE or SDR behavior. These rates likely vary by company, so a unified answer of what is best will remain elusive. Third, PLG doesn’t change the sales structure or operations today. Customer success goals focus on farming rather than selling or expansion. SDRs (sales development reps) qualify these leads, much the way they might for marketing qualified leads or outbound sales qualified leads. AEs close the leads irrespective of their source. PLG brings product teams under the umbrella of the go-to-market team. In the past, VPs of marketing and sales would divvy up lead generation responsibilities. PLG companies should expect their VPs of Product to sign up for a lead quota, too

In 2015, Dremio started in our offices. Today, the company announced its Series E at $2 billion valuation . The business has cemented itself as a foundational component of the Modern Data Stack. About seven years ago, Dremio’s founder Tomer envisioned a product that would enable customers to manage data and compute separately. Today, we call this idea the data lakehouse and a query engine. Dremio enables Amazon, FactSet, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, NCR, and Nutanix, amongst others to query oceanic volumes of data at comparable speed to data warehouses. Last year, the company introduced Dremio Cloud - a fully managed, data lakehouse. These advances are the results of years of dedicated work to solve difficult technical challenges. Out of that effort, and in collaboration with others in the ecosystem, Dremio has furthered Apache Arrow (the standard in columnar file formats), Apache Arrow Flight (rapid data transfer), and Nessie (a Git-like experience for data). Arrow alone is downloaded millions of times per month. The result of all this effort is a community of people passionate about data who congregate at Subsurface , our biannual conference, which draws thousands of attendees and hundreds of talks. Congratulations to the Dremio team on achieving another milestone.

The public software sector is weathering the second deepest multiple contraction in the last decade. Only the 2016 reduction of 57% surpasses it. Public market investors are rotating out of high growth technology companies as the Fed’s policies of quantitative easing, asset purchases, and low rates abate. The question on every software founder’s mind today must be, how will this affect the private financing markets? As a company’s scale approaches that of a public company, the greater the impact on their fundraising. Three corrections in the last ten years have contracted multiples by 40% or more. These are marked in peachpuff orange rectangles above. The Series D mean round size is plotted in red. 2014’s correction stalled and then reversed Series D round sizes for 2 years through the second correction in 2016. For the next 3 years, Series Ds increased in size until the late 2019/early 2020 correction of 41%. If history serves as an occasionally-correct guide, later stage valuations should flatten and fall in 2022, especially in light of the doubling of round sizes in the last 18 months. Series As don’t imitate this pattern, remaining insulated from the vacillations of the market. Corrections may subdue the growth rates, but haven’t reversed them in the past. One could argue the slopes in the round sizes differ from last time. Ds doubled in 18 months starting in 2016, and again doubled from $75m to $150m in 2020-2021 - so the growth has been steeper on the way up and that may suggest a more sudden correction on the other side of the peak.

The Great Resignation has rippled across headlines and boardrooms as employees’ values and priorities evolve. Has the Great Resignation been caused by a silent stagnation in compensation? Let’s compare data from 2010 and 2021 to understand the longitudinal trends in cash and equity compensation. The cash compensation of three executive roles at early-stage companies has increased faster than inflation. Role 2010 Cash 2021 Cash Cash Change VPE 219 256 17% VPM 220 250 14% VPS 320 404 26% CPI 217 262 21% A VP of Engineering in a Bay Area startup that has raised less than twenty-five million dollars earned 17% more in 2021 than 2010. In constant dollars (correcting for inflation, which is listed here as CPI), a 2021 VPE took home 4% less. VPs of Marketing saw similar raises across their salary and bonus, and small loss to inflation. On the other hand, heads of sales’ pay appreciated 5 percentage points more than inflation. Role 2010 Equity 2021 Equity Equity Change VPE 1.6% 2.0% 33% VPM 1.2% 1.1% -8% VPS 1.5% 1.4% -7% Equity value surged. We’ll use two tables to tell the story here. VPs of engineering today command 33% more than their 2010 younger selves. Equity grants for VPSs and VPMs are down on an ownership basis by about 7-8%. But remember the equity value is the ownership multiplied by the valuation. During the intravening decennium, startup valuation have compounded at 24% annually. Year Series A Post-Money Valuation, $m Value of 1% Equity, $m 2010 12.5 0.125 2021 105 1.05 Owning 1.4% of a company worth $105m, an executive is 7.4x better off than ten years ago. I’m ignoring the cost of exercising options and the 409a price to simplify the math. Assuming the 409a methods haven’t changed in this period, the increase in take-home pay multiple would be constant, but the amount is reduced by the cost of option exercise. Overall, executives earn considerably more than eleven years ago, driven primarily by equity value. Cash hasn’t outpaced inflation. The question I haven’t answered is whether compensation at larger companies has materially outpaced startups’ raises. But if you’re a startup person, the data suggests you’re better paid than ten years ago in equity.

In the last few weeks, public software company multiples have halved. As have cryptocoins. Solana and Etherum followed Snowflake and Elastic downwards. So much for the Santa Claus rally . Both declines seem to have been catalyzed by the Fed’s intention to hike the Fed Funds rate three to four times in 2022. Beyond the most recent cycle, how often do the web2 and web3 software markets move in synchrony? After all, Web3 is a future incarnation of software and infrastructure. Like high growth startups, cryptocoins are considered risk assets by the market. Is historical data compelling enough to hypothesize that investors’ rotation out of high-growth software should be mirrored in crypto? I’ve indexed the performance of four assets over the last five years: public software companies (CLD), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the 10 Year Treasury yield (TNX). BTC, ETH and Software have all increased over the last five years (notice the y-axis is log10 scale). The cryptocoins appreciated much more than software. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10 year Treasury declined. Over that period, the correlations between these assets are tight. Factor Correlation with Software BTC 0.76 ETH 0.61 TNX -0.67 BTC and ETH chart a 0.76 and 0.61 correlation with software suggesting the markets do move in parallel. In contrast, the 10 Year Treasury yield negatively correlates at -0.67 implying software market value tends to increase with lower rates. Plotting the pairwise correlations by year uncovers a few trends not apparent in the five year analysis. CLD has a volatile relationship with BTC and ETH, the correlation hopping from one foot of 0.6 to to the other at -0.3 and back again. CLD correlates negatively to the 10 year yield at around 0.5. Economics students would argue the discounted cash flow model predicts this behavior. Companies with profits in future years should be less valuable during times of higher interest rates. BTC and ETC moved more or less in synchrony from 2016 to 2018. Three years ago, they went their separate ways. Price movements diverged and the gap has widened over time, suggesting investors view them differently; perhaps one as a store of value and the other a utility token. Over longer epochs, the web2 and web3 markets seem to move in parallel. But the data makes plain that investors don’t view these two asset classes interchangeably. Some years, crypto moves with software. Others, cryptocoins move the opposite way. Both web2 and web3 software are risk assets but each market marches to its own beat.

After writing my predictions for the year 2022 , a reader asked how I would measure if this were truly the decade of data. Good question! The market determines which sectors are in favor and which sectors aren’t. Stealing a page from Michael Mauboussin’s Expectations Investing , company value contains information about investors’ expectations for a company. Naturally, comparing data companies’ valuations to the market should reveal investors’ aspirations for the data sector relative to the market writ large. Looking at overall data, in the early 2010s data companies raised money at valuations indistinguishable from other startups. During the middle of the decade, data companies traded at a small discount, which is likely statistically significant given the sample size (n=1300-1700 depending on the year). 2018 was the watershed year. Data startups commanded a 47% premium. Two years later, the figure spiked to 60% and last year, the market placed a 75% premium. But there’s a problem with this analysis: it doesn’t account for the round composition changing. If data companies raised more later stage rounds than early rounds, the figure would spike. Looking at Series A figures, we see a similar pattern but smaller amplitude. Data companies traded at a discount in the early 2010s and now they trade at a modest premium, about 10% average in the last 5 years, contrasting the 15% discount of the early part of the decade. Sectors rotate from being in-favor to out-of-favor, and that’s certainly the case with data both at the Series A and the market broadly.

With the summer of Defi behind us and a new year for web3, I wondered which categories of web3 startups generate the most revenue. L1s or blockchains, the public databases that record transactions, dominate the revenue share across the top projects producing 78% of revenue. Exchanges place second. Right behind, NFT exchanges rank third. Defi Protocols, which include lending, perps, farming, and swaps, slot in fourth. Gaming, Wallets, Infrastructure, Consumer Apps, Insurance and Asset Management chart negligible share. Sector Revenue Share Market Cap Share L1 78% 88% Exchange 6.4% 1.7% NFT 5.9% 0% Defi Protocols 3.8% 2.1% Gaming 3.3% 1.1% Wallet 1.6% 0 Infrastructure 0.5% 6.6% Web3 valuation mechanisms are nascent, fuzzy, and perhaps not-yet-existent. But we can compare the revenue share to circulating market cap share across projects. Deltas between the figures provide insight into which sectors’ tokens investors price at relatively elevated multiples. L1s command 10 percentage points more market cap share than revenue share, suggesting investors apply a premium to them. Exchanges suffer the reverse: 6.4% revenue share but 1.7% market share. Lower multiples may results from historical precedent: exchanges have traditionally been low-margin businesses. NFTs and Wallet chalk 0% market share because none of these projects have launched token yet, though I expect that to change soon. Defi Protocols and Gaming’s share of market cap is less than revenue, while Infrastructure companies clock 11x market cap share compared to revenue share, suggesting Infrastructure is a prized category. A naive view of this table: investors believe in the long-term prospects, defensibility, margin structure, tokenomics, and ultimately attractiveness of certain web3 businesses enough to apply better multiples to different categories, just the way investors apply different valuation multiples to web2 software companies. In reality, the markets are still so new,  valuation mechanisms so novel, and price swings driven by social signals that it’s spurious to apply this way of thinking to an embryonic market. Setting aside sector, TVL (total value locked), trading volume, twitter followers, and revenue are the four most robust correlates to circulating market cap. TVL is at 0.71, which is strong. Volume and market cap are naturally correlated because bigger outstanding token counts should drive more volume in trading.  Price to revenue is last in this analysis. In other words, social proof in crypto is vital, demonstrated both by people voting with their dollars (TVL) and with their attention (Twitter followers). Revenue and age correlate weakly. A year from now, I expect significant changes in these data points. L1 revenue will remain dominant but other categories will wrest share. Infrastructure companies selling to web3 developers should benefit from a surge in revenue as the web3 ecosystem flourishes. Wallets, the quotidian entry point for web3 users, will exert more influence in the ecosystem, too. – A few notes about this analysis. The underlying economics of each of these businesses is very different. The data in this ecosystem is quite early. The categorization is my own. Revenues are only revenues captured by tokens, not dollar revenues for software sales or token payments for services/software. Market cap doesn’t include private company valuations or equity only businesses.  On the whole, this analysis is more deKoonings’ broad brushstrokes than Manet’s precise realism.

These are my favorite books from this year. The Future of Money . I’m waist deep in this compendium of financial history that traces money from the first paper currency issued by Kublai Khan to modern day crypto. The Future of Money is great so far, but I’m running out of time to finish it before 2022, so it might not truly
belong on this list! Words like Loaded Pistols . I discovered rhetoric in 2021 and read this book and The Elements of Eloquence which demonstrate the hundreds of literary devices we use to imbue language with flourish to entice or cajole the reader to hurdle over the period at the end of a sentence and sprint through the next, till the end of a tract. The Sovereign Individual is an older book but foundational reading for web3. As taxpayers, we are customers of the government. At some point, most governments fail to produce enough value to justify the federal vigorish . Defiant citizens dissatisfied with their ROI revolt either by decamping or demanding regime change. The Code Breaker relates the history behind CRISPR, a technology that enables biochemists to alter DNA via RNA, and the woman behind the innovation Jennifer Doudna. Walter Isaacson’s profile illuminates the science and history behind mRNA vaccines and poses difficult questions about the future of gene editing. A Swim in a Pond in the Rain . George Saunders teaches one of the most lauded courses in fiction writing. He recasts his syllabus into this page by page dissection of four of the greatest Russian writers’ short stories, a tour guide illustrating how these geniuses weave wonderful worlds and evoke emotions in few words. Big Debt Crises and The Changing World Order trace Ray Dalio’s journey to understand macroeconomics throughout history. Dalio’s decades as an
investor orient this potentially dry topic into a relatable and actionable guide to how to think about the US’ next 50 years. How Emotions are Made .  Anger doesn’t provoke increased heart rate, flushing of the cheeks, and rage universally. Rather fury is something we define and create in our brains individually. Separately, emotional granularity, possessing an ample lexicon of different feeling-words, forms the essence of effective communication. Draft No. 4 . John McPhee has written for the New Yorker for more than 56 years, authored more than 30 books, taught non-fiction at Princeton, received the Pulitzer, and pioneered the use of fiction-techniques in non-fiction. He narrates how he writes through his work. Stunning. This is How They Tell Me the World Ends . If you need more motivation to start using a password manager, this is it. Perlroth recounts how the smallest lapses in security snowball into massive international fiascoes and uncovers the clandestine war fought using the same wires that we use to surf the web. The Order of Time . The Order of Time simplifies quantum relativity with poeticism by relating the science to quotidian experience. Midnight in Chernobyl the hour-by-hour story of heroism and fecklessness in the face of a history-making disaster. Reads like a spy-thriller. Engines that Move Markets . Phillipe Laffont tweeted this is one of his two favorite books; Mindset completing the pair. Reminiscent of Carlota Perez’s Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital , Engines that Moves Markets traces the boom and bust cycles of key industries like telephony, trains, and energy on the United States and its financial markets. A Man for All Markets . Edward Thorpe ran a hugely lucrative hedge fund pricing convertible warrants, developed techniques for beating the house at blackjack and trained a cabal of MIT kids to do the same, derived Black-Scholes’ options pricing formula independently, and spearheaded the use of the Kelly criterion in finance .

Every year I make a list of predictions and score last year’s predictions . 2021 marked the second year of COVID and like other crises, the pandemic accelerated change, especially in technology pushing many technologies like SaaS, video conferencing, crypto/web3 deeper into the Perez deployment cycle . Here are my predictions for 2022: Web3 consumer products go fully mainstream with more than 35% of Americans, about 100m people, engaging with them by 2023. Metamask counts 10m MAU and Phantom is at 1.5m MAU growing quickly. This trend is only increasing. Wallets are the gateway to crypto and have funneled millions into consumer apps that have driven web3 adoption. These throngs stress systems and demand infrastructure advances. Improved infrastructure enables new applications, which attract more users. This oscillation between apps and infrastructure continues forever as a pendulum . Meanwhile, once there are enough infrastructure and consumer companies to serve, software businesses pop up, in this case to serve DAOs. Data companies continue to achieve astronomical growth. Software engineering best practices have begun to infuse data: data observability, specialization of different ETL layers, data exploration, and data security all thrived in 2021 and will continue as users stuff more data into databases and data lakehouses. Large software companies accelerated growth this year, despite their scale reinforcing the notion that users write data into systems but rarely delete it. GPT-3 and BERT infuse software massively reducing repetitive work and unlocking huge productivity gains. GTP-3 and BERT are massive machine learning systems called neural nets. Their neuron count is only one or two orders of magnitude less than a human brain, and parity isn’t far off. The result of all a supremely rational artificial cerebrum: type in a few key sentences into a GPT-3 powered app, click a button, and a blog post pops out. (Not this one; I enjoy writing too much to automate it). Or a personalized email to a sales prospect. Or a tweet. Toil will be automated by these robots, leaving us to garnish the vanilla cake output with a layer of digital frosting. Marketing, customer success, and sales software will be upended. Engineers’ productivity will skyrocket as AI pair programming increases code authoring speed and reduces errors simultaneously. The ML stack folds into the classic data stack. This idea is more controversial. The vast majority of ML users prefer simplicity and speed to customization and control. Consequently, data innovators will continue to push AutoML and SQL to query ML models to the technically analytical. Much of what’s built in the ML stack is a re-implementation of the modern data stack. ML specific data applications aren’t much different than classical data applications. ML specific feature stores can be managed through data lakehouse technologies like Nessie and Parquet, just as regular data ought to be. These stacks will begin a convergence. Within Google, Facebook, and other data leaders bespoke systems remain de rigeur as a core strategic advantage. The spirit of Silicon Valley continues a spread outward. The valley remains an important locus on innovation but its monopoly recedes as new geographies rise in importance and remote work, plus the return of in-person travel, creates a new way of working for many. Silicon Valley falls to below 20% in all venture financing. Scoring last year’s predictions: Working remotely for a year changes how we work forever . Absolutely this happened. Friends have relocated to different cities. Remote-first and remote-only companies have gone public. Video-conferencing and remote collaboration is an integral part of knowledge workers days forever. 2020 becomes the decade of data . Yes. The Snowflake IPO, the forth-coming DataBricks IPO. The valuation multiples in the data world top software both in the public markets and private markets. M&As and IPOs continue at torrid rates . Yes. In 2021, 601 venture-backed IPOs raised $198b, up 40% in deal count and 173% in dollars. M&A value increased 24% and volumes up 28%. Both figures are records in the past decade. Blockchain technologies become mainstream driven by the adoption of national reserve banks . Whiff. Central bank digital coins (CBDC)s are still very early in the US and China. El Salvador’s adoption of BTC and the Lightning network is a canary but the flock is still very much still at the nest. Product-led growth becomes the standard GTM and infrastructure companies. Half a point. Most companies pitch PLG forward motions when raising capital and some have internal initiatives to push in this direction. But in the day-to-day operations of the majority of businesses, classic sales and marketing motions are the classical ones; and the transition has proved more fundamental and a longer investment to achieve. 3.5; same as last year. I’ll take a 70% accuracy on a one year prediction as success. Regardless of these predictions, the pace of innovation and the breadth of advancement spellbinds me. Ten years ago, we carried the iPhone 4 and the Motorola Droid in our pockets. Cryptocurrencies hadn’t been invented. VCs invested $10b per year. Most of us commuted every day and conference call bridges were state of the art. Electric cars remained curiosities and NASA sent the Space Shuttle to refuel the International Space Station. Today, the iPhone has the leading chip architecture, the Google Pixels use ML to edit images and translate instantly. SpaceX will launch one rocket into space every other week. Electric car sales are doubling year over year and virtual backgrounds make every room our home office.

Ten years ago, startups pulled capital from the capital markets. A startup raised money, executed for 12-24 months then sought more capital on Sand Hill, flaunting milestones to justify a higher valuation. Today, a global investor base pre-emptively shoehorns dollars into the most attractive startups, saturating the balance sheet with cash every six to nine months. I call these mark-to-market rounds. Mark-to-market rounds press private markets closer to public markets in three ways. First, these financings establish a company’s value on a near-quarterly basis. Public companies are marked-to-market daily, but “more precisely” after quarterly earnings. Second, mark-to-market rounds offer secondary. Investors furnish founders and early employees with cash in exchange for common shares. Secondaries are common for publicly traded companies, too; it’s customary to sell secondary six months after a startup’s IPO. Third, investors price these infusions on multiples just the way a sell-side equity analyst would. Many investors extend the analogy by staffing a research arm. Their pdf output analyses the space, lauds the business’s prospects within it, and dissects relevant rivals. (link to 100x ARR) The mark-to-market phenomenon fundamentally alters the board’s discussion of an investment proposal. Rather than debating if the offer fuels the financial plan fully, boards consider loftier questions. Will the quantum of capital and the headline valuation anoint the company the winner in its category? How might the brand of the leading investor bolster the startup’s market presence? What improvement in recruiting close rates can the company expect? Might the increase in 409a valuations offset that gain? Can the secondary improve employee retention? Is the business comfortable with a larger preference stack? Mark-to-market rounds aren’t going away. In fact, we should expect more of them as the private market’s behavior asymptotes to the public market’s. Some of our portfolio companies raise mark-to-markets annually or bi-annually as a matter of course to demonstrate strength, provide liquidity, forestall an IPO. Others leverage mark-to-markets as a defense against M&A. Still others forgo them altogether, not wanting to burden the balance sheet with excess assets. And last, some decide to negotiate the valuations lower, preferring a consistent and more modest price increase, and the confidence of knowing next year the business will be worth more, irrespective of a correction. As passive venture investing continues to grow and venture dollars swell and swirl, each startup will need to define their own strategy of whether to entertain mark-to-market rounds and at which terms.

Tokens are the paid customer acquisition channel of web3. By analyzing how web3 companies invest tokens, we can calculate the cost of customer acquisition (CAC) for a crypto company. When a user spins up a validator to verify transactions on a blockchain, stresses the testnet and is rewarded with tokens, stakes tokens to generate yield, burns tokens to transact, or receives an airdrop for tweeting, a cryptoco expends tokens to acquire a customer. Hence tokens, which have value, constitute the business’s CAC. Web2 sales and marketing techniques pervade our inboxes, plaster our browsers, and percolate in our voicemails. In their own way, web2 companies spend dollars to acquire customers and partners and build an ecosystem. The profit and loss statement of a business records the quantum on the Selling & Marketing Expenses line. Let’s contrast the sales and marketing investments of web2 companies to web3 companies. We can benchmark them relative to their corporate value. This analysis should imply something interesting about the fraction of tokens ought to be offered to a community . Typical enterprise software companies spend approximately 7-15% of their enterprise value on customer acquisition. L1 Web3 companies spend 29-95%. Percentile Web2 S&M Spend as % of EV[1] Web3 Community Coin Ownership as %[2] Web3/Web2 25th 4% 29% 7.3x 50th 7% 31% 4.4x 75th 15% 44% 2.9x The comparison between web2 and web3 is stark, 3-7x higher CAC relative to corporate value. Even if the estimates are off by a factor of 2 or more, this math suggests crypto companies acquire customers less efficiently than their older brothers. It also suggests future token cap tables may not be so community focused in the future, a phenomenon we’ve already observed in L1 token allocations . In all fairness, the web2/3 CAC comparison is somewhat clementines and satsumas for a few reasons. equity and tokens are different instruments web2 companies have been highly optimized after two decades of refinement the valuation frameworks between web2 & web3 companies aren’t identical this calculation doesn’t include testnet incentives it excludes ecosystem funds raised by cryptocos to develop their ecosystems Nevertheless, the concept of CAC will permeate crypto go-to-market strategies at some point. But not today. I haven’t met a crypto company that talks about CAC. Or sales and marketing spend. Or ROI. It’s too early in the development of the ecosystem for most businesses to concentrate on customer acquisition funnel optimization. We’re still focused on discovering to which of the 6,000 filaments is the ideal chemistry to sustain the crypto light bulb and bring NFTs to millions of homes.  For Edison, Tungsten worked best. Uncannily, cryptoland has decided Tungsten cubes might just be our thing . Plus the $38b of venture capital invested in crypto year-to-date doesn’t ask many questions. 1000x returns have a way of pacifying hesitation and silencing skepticism At some point, though, we’ll examine the costs of customer acquisition via token and ask whether tokens do fundamentally change the economics of growth. Until then, buidl and hodl. – Footnotes [1] The base data is the basket of publicly traded cloud companies as of the date of writing. Multiply the selling & marketing expense by 1/3 over 10 years for a rough estimate of lifetime selling and marketing expense. Then divide by enterprise value. One could argue 15 years is a better estimate for lifetime, but the S&M expenses in the early years are de minimus relative to the outer years. Why multiply by 1/3? Take an imaginary company that spends the following on selling and marketing, and assume it maps linearly to ARR of a high growth business, the average is roughly 1/3 the value of the current spend. Another way of thinking about it: it’s the area of a triangle with a roughly 60 degree interior angle, proxy for 60% annual growth over these years. It’s an approximation: let’s go with it for now! Year Spend 1 1 2 5 3 15 4 30 5 60 6 110 7 180 Avg 57.3 [2] I’m using the estimated sum of the public presale and community allocations using data from L1s via Messari .

Since 2016, public software has witnessed four corrections. Today, we’re in the midst of the fifth. Also, 2014 to 2016 saw a 57% reduction in multiples and of course after 2008. But let’s look at the most recent five years. This chart shows the median and the 75th percentile of enterprise value/forward revenue multiple for the basket of public stocks which were public at that moment in time. Correction Year Max Min % Change 2014 7.7 3.3 -57% 2016 7.2 4.5 -37% 2018 13.7 10.0 -27% 2019 19.8 12.8 -35% 2020 31.8 18.5 -41% 2021 27.2 19.5 -28% These corrections reduced valuations by between 30% and 60%. These undulations are short-lived. The market recorded new highs often within four to six quarters after the nadir. The net result is multiples have charted a volatile course with a positive slope. What a growth investor ought to expect. In fact, the 75th percentile multiple has appreciated 25% annually since 2016 and the median has increased by approximately 20%. Cloud companies’ fast growth multiplied by an appreciation in multiples has pushed valuations higher since 2014. How does this map to the private market? Till 2020, the growth rates of the private market valuations and the public valuation multiples paralleled each other at the highest level. However, the private markets remained steadfast in their valuation methodologies, irrespective of the volatility in the public markets, 2021 changed all that - no fancy analysis needed! The hockey stick is a discontinuous event. Perhaps investors have been undervaluing companies for the last two decades. Or perhaps we’ll see some reversion to the mean. When is anyone’s guess. Reading these data, the natural question is what is an accurate forward multiple for a company ? The answer is it depends on an investors’ holding period and the company’s financials and prospects. Historically, public market valuations haven’t impacted private markets. But perhaps, this time is different. If so, the unique difference has more to do with the recent discontinuous behavior of the private markets than the public markets.

At Redpoint, we’ve been spending more time in crypto. The foundational layers of the next wave of technology innovation are constructed today. In some ways, they parallel their forebears in classical infrastructure. In others, these businesses are completely novel. We met the Mysten Labs team ( Adeniyi Abiodun , Evan Cheng , George Danezis , Sam Blackshear ) and learned about their history developing technology for Facebook’s crypto infrastructure. The more we listened, the team’s depth in distributed systems, cryptography, and programming languages amazed us. This team is responsible for developing Facebook’s blockchain (Diem) and the Move programming language, two fundamental projects within the ecosystem. The core of the company’s mission is to solve the challenges of scalability and programmability. High transaction/gas fees pervade crypto and limit adoption. In addition, crypto programming languages aren’t safe enough to prevent attacks. Mysten’s technology solves both, empowering developers to build software that’s faster and more secure. Mysten aims to solve the scaling challenges for core crypto infrastructure in two ways. First, Narwhal is a high performance mempool that integrates with BFT consensus protocols and integrates the Move programming language for better security and performance. Mysten partners with L1s to accelerate their core systems and is working with Sommelier & Celo already. In addition, they are developing a blazing fast NFT platform which aims to enable seamless movement of NFTs across blockchains. If you’re curious to build on Mysten’s technology, email build@mystenlabs.com and if you’re interested in working with this incredible team solving scalability and security challenges in crypto, see the careers page. The company is hiring!

A few weeks ago, Office Hours at Redpoint welcomed Claire Hughes-Johnson, former COO at Stripe and VP at Google. Claire’s operational experience is one-of-a-kind, and the conversation focused on scaling startups. I remember joining Google in 2005. In the halls, I heard colleagues say great things about how terrific a leader Claire is. When I read Elad Gil’s High Growth Handbook and saw Claire’s unauthorized guide on how to work with her, I knew we needed to have her on the show. Here are my notes and the full transcript is here On Manager Guides: the manager guides stemmed from Google, where Claire ran the Great Manager Awards. One year, Claire moderated a panel during which a recipient mentioned this idea, following the example of Urs Hölzle, who had done the same. Claire replicated it at Stripe. These guides were voluntary: each manager elected to do it. Manager guides worked particularly well across regions and across cultures as a way of building rapport quickly during high growth. On aligning a company: Today, Stripe operates with quarterly OKRs but it used to operate with a 6 month goal planning process. Goal frameworks ensure that the priorities of the leadership team coalesce the priorities of the rest of the organization. The particular framework isn’t important. Rather, the clarity of the goals and the repetition in their communication create internal alignment. On metrics: Early in Stripe’s history, the company tracked output metrics in dashboards. Those dashboards predated goals. When the leadership team shifted to set goals, they asked managers to track input metrics ( leading indicators ), operational metrics, and strategic metrics. Strategic metrics are the numbers that move over quarters or years, eg, share of global payment volume. On internal meetings: Stripe asked teams to create strategy documents to describe why they exist - what’s the team’s mission and strategy? Who are the customers (internal or external)? These documents are called charters. Those charters created a sequence of business reviews, which started with written memos. The color, the narrative of how the team was doing was the most valuable part of these documents. The cadence for each team changed depending on the state of that team. Those are some of the many highlights from the session. Claire’s experience on the leadership team of two of the greatest startup successes has given her a panoply of lessons and insights on how to scale. Claire is writing a book about management due to publish next year. Given everything I learned during our session, I’m certain it will become a classic.

Founded by Sanjit Biswas, former CEO at Meraki and John Bicket former CTO at Merakihttps://www.samsara.com/, Samsara builds software to manage physical operations: truck fleets, mining, food & beverage, oil & gas. If a business has to manage physical assets with drivers, there’s a Samsara product for it. Incidentally, the name Samsara is the cycle of life and death in Sanskrit. The software provides safety, video based coaching, dispatch productivity, and logistics efficiency by instrumenting vehicles and other assets with video and telematics (systems that send data to computers for analysis.) Atop these sensors, Samsara software executes workflows, provides drivers with apps, monitors equipment, and provides managers and executives visibility into the operations of a site. Metric 2020 2021 2022E Revenue, $M 119.9 249.9 432* Revenue Growth - 108% 73% Gross Margin 59.6% 69.8% - Sales Efficiency - 0.57 0.70 Net Income Margin -188% -84% - Cash Flow from Ops Margin -161% -69% - NDR - 115% - Average Customer Value, $k - 19.7 - ACV, Core Customers - 35.2 - Enterprise Customers 255 452 715* ARR 194 342 492 ARR per Employee 267 330 - Founded in 2016, Samsara has grown explosively from $119.9m in revenue in fiscal year 2020, to $432m in the first three quarters of fiscal 2022. The company’s metrics all recorded positive gains including gross margin moving from 60% to 70%, which is impressive for a business providing hardware. 71% is the public SaaS company median. The company counts more than 25,000 customers of which 13,000 generate more than $5,000 in ARR, and 715 spend more than $100k annually with the company. In the S-1 , Samsara highlights the frequent cross-pollination of products within accounts. 52% of all customers buy at least two products and 73% of customers worth more than $5k do the same. This results in a 115% NDR. Samsara has adopted a few interesting go-to market techniques. The first is the company sell 3 or 5 year contracts that are non-refundable and non-cancellable at relatively small ACVs of $35k. The last public company to adopt a similar strategy also happened to be in telematics: Fleetmatics . Multi-year deals are much more common at price points greater than $150k. But these contracts produce compelling economics. Customers produce an LTV:CAC ratio of 8:1. Because the contracts are secure and long term and the cash is collected up front, Samsara reinvests those dollars immediately into additional sales & marketing efforts , which produces a very efficient cash sales efficiency and presumably a very short days-sales-outstanding (though this isn’t disclosed. In addition, Samsara enjoys strong and improving accrual sales efficiency of 0.70. Second, is the focus up-market after having amassed a significant customer base. The company writes, “We focus on customers representing over $100,000 in ARR…” The company aims to cross-sell more products and enable channel partners to deliver those solutions. All this results in a tremendous business that has achieved about $500m in ARR in just six years. How much will Samsara be worth in the public markets? Using a linear regression on current cloud valuations and a combination of key metrics, about 41-42x which implies about $16-18b. Congratulations to the Samsara team on building an incredible company with a unique go-to-market strategy and achieving incredible scale so quickly. * Estimated metrics using company data, but not reported by the company explicitly

Words like Loaded Pistols . What an arresting title for a book. I decided to read it just based on its cover. In the first few pages, I learned that it’s a book about rhetoric. What is rhetoric? I met a few people in college who studied it, and I thought it had to do with logic or philosophy. I was wrong. It’s the art of convincing others with words. Rhetoric formed a major part of educational curricula before the mid-20th century, but has fallen out of favor for other disciplines. I wish it hadn’t. In the book, Sam Leith deconstructs the works of evocative orators: Aristotle, Cicero, Churchill, Luther King Jr., amongst many others. How do they do it? It turns out there’s a formula that’s been in use since the Greeks. The book enumerates the troika of persuasive arguments: ethos, logos, and pathos. Ethos means using your credibility to support your reasoning. Take my advice because I’ve been in VC for 15 years. Logos isn’t logic, even though it might seem so. Rather, logos is the narrative that enables an audience to reach your intended point before you do. Convincing arguments don’t need to be hermetic, vacuums sapping oxygen from counterpoints; rather, they can be elegant leaps from one point to another that drive an audience to a conclusion. Logic must be airtight. For example, Redpoint is the best partner for you because of our experience with Stripe, Twilio, Snowflake, & Looker. Pathos is about the emotion behind the appeal, which can be euphoria, despair, exhortation. Please take my investment dollars or I won’t be able to return the fund to feed my fish. Powerful rhetoric leverages all three. In addition, cogent debaters interlace twists of phrase with poetic cadence. If you’ve ever studied Shakespeare’s iambic pentameter or listened to the climax “I Have a Dream” you’ll recognize how important the rhythm is to evocative language. And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that, let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring. Let freedom ring is the drumbeat to the speech’s crescendo. Words Like a Loaded Pistol provides a sweeping analysis of eloquent argument and tangible techniques for implementing it. There’s even a 10 page glossary of different techniques from alliteration (same sounds sequentially) to zeugma (a verb acting on two objects with different meanings), circumlocution (talking around a point) to pleonasm (using superfluous words).

When investing in a crypto startup that will issue a token, an investor considers two prices - the price of the equity and the price of the token . There’s a rule of thumb used today that states the token should be worth 3-5x the equity. A founder informed me the rationale is that a share in a company has a lien on the future dividend streams, but a token has a lien on profit share of the GDP around an economy and that economies tend to be 3-5x larger. Walking home from a meeting with a crypto team in Brooklyn, my colleague, Alex, I played around with this idea. Is 4x the right number? We tried to calculate the GDP of Salesforce’s ecosystem and the Google economy, but we were guessing. Where could we find analogous data? The best data I found is the economies of countries. Each country charts a GDP figure and publishes a tax rate. With those two numbers, we can derive the token valuation equivalent for countries. It’s not a perfect analogy but good enough for a thought experiment. Here’s the analogy in a visual form. Google creates an economy around itself. Google taxes that economy by charging for ads on search pages and captures a portion of that GDP. A country develops an economy and captures revenue as taxes. If we can compute the GDP/Tax Revenue multiple for countries, we could make some observations about whether they might hold for crypto companies. Let’s call this number the Economy/Tax Revenue Ratio or ETR. ETR = GDP/Revenue I pulled data from the OECD and found some interesting things when analyzing all countries’ data. There is no relationship between size of economy and tax rate . Nor is there any relationship between the GDP and the ETR multiple. We can observe the median ETR multiple is 4.9x. If we examine G10, the 10 largest economies, median ETR is 3.5x and the 75th percentile is 5.2x. The chart orders the countries by GDP, largest on the bottom. Those figures are consistent with the crypto rule of thumb. The correlation between the growth rate of the economy (using 2019 data and the ETR) is 0.8. This is surprising and may say something about the efficiency of markets even at global scale. Ok, that was a lot. Let’s recapitulate. most countries operate with a ETR of between 3-5x GDP to tax revenue the ETR is correlated with growth the median tax rate for G10 countries 28.5% of GDP How does that map to crypto? If we use our analogy of country::economy as crypto-company::economy, then the multiples resemble each other. But, the growth rates and tax rates of countries and crypto companies couldn’t be more different. The major differences are that crypto economies are growing orders of magnitude faster than most developed economies. Ethereum generated as much revenue last month as all last year, for example. No crypto token collects 24% of revenue, as the median country does. In summary, if you assume the significantly greater growth rates of crypto companies offset the meaningfully lower tax rates, then you might be able to pencil out a 3-5x token:equity multiple. But, at least using this data set, the conclusion remains quite a leap, and my hunt for a better proxy data set continues.

Imagine an AE closes two contracts for $100k ARR. The contracts are identical twelve month contracts except for the payment terms. Contract A requires annual prepayment - all the cash will be paid tomorrow. Contract B relaxes payment terms to monthly payment, 12 monthly installments for the next year. Is the payback period for each contract the same? On one hand, I could plug the numbers into the formula blindly and reply yes, they are identical. But the contracts are substantially different to the company. Contract A pays for itself today. Said otherwise, Contract A has a payback period of 0 days. All of the sales and marketing dollars invested to obtain persuade the buyer to put digital ink to pdf have been recouped immediately. One couldn’t assert the same for contract B, which takes 10 months in our hypothetical example. For a company with a longer payback, the payback period implicitly assumes a successful renewal to achieve the same positive effect on the company balance sheet. The payback period metric doesn’t capture the difference in the quality of the revenue/cash collections. That may seem like a distinction without a difference but the distinction is an important difference. A startup closing only Contract As will be far more capital efficient than one capturing Contract Bs. Contract As don’t require  burning equity dollars to hire more AEs; the company reinvests customer revenue dollars to scale. Let’s take this idea time scale further out: multi-year deals. A multi-year prepay offers even greater benefit to a software company. It’s an interest-free loan from a customer to grow the GTM team. For example, if a three-year contract is discounted the startup’s cost of capital for borrowing is simply the discount amortized over the contract period (eg, 10% over three years or 3.2% per year which incidentally costs less than venture debt). And the company has two years of marginal profit to invest in the GTM. Most startups today prefer to run their sales teams on annual deals to accelerate sales cycles and minimize the risk of clawing back commissions on multi-year deals that churn at some point in the service period. But there is a viable GTM strategy for startups to book multi-year deals with pre-payment, and use that cash to finance GTM growth. Especially if logo churn is low, account expansion is strong, and the sales cycles are brief. Cash collections ought to be considered when calculating the payback period. After all, the point of the payback period metric is to determine when to invest more in sales and marketing. If an account executive can recoup all the cost of customer acquisition immediately, shouldn’t the startup collect those dollars and hire another AE? Today, investors (myself included) use payback period as an efficiency yardstick to compare the relative efficiency of GTM spend from one company to the next. It’s also useful to understand how much risk is involved with payback periods of longer than a year. That’s a useful tool. But it’s divorced from the original purpose of the payback period of determining when to double down on scaling a GTM team. It’s time for two metrics to exist: a cash-flow based months-to-repay and an accrual accounting metric.

The 100x ARR multiple might be the fundraising meme of 2021. Before, most investors used forward ARR multiples to value companies, but recently, the 100x multiple seems to be a benchmark for SaaS companies raising rounds. Where did this figure originate? How does it compare to the public markets’ valuation of companies? Let’s look at the data. Here are the estimated ARR multiples for public SaaS companies. I estimated ARR as the annualized revenue of the most recent fiscal quarter. The distribution of enterprise value to ARR multiples parallels those of EV/NTM revenue in a few ways. First, the range is similar: 2 to about 100. Second, the correlation between the two metrics and revenue growth is identical at about 36%. Third, there’s a power law shape to both data sets. I don’t know if the market has decided to afford highly sought after ARR multiples by looking at this data. But the data suggests a company commanding 100x ARR is supported by the market, if the startup is in the top 5% of businesses. The quartile distribution of multiples tells a different story. The 75th percentile multiple is 26x ARR and the median is 17x. Of course, these multiples are for public companies; anyone can buy shares. The private market has a pattern of paying premiums to public figures because access is the scarcest commodity in startupland . The question before most investors today is: how much of a premium to pay? It depends and the premium implies the number of years of perfect execution the investor credits the startup team. The greater the premium, the greater the future forward expectation of performance. The market is observing investments fetching 200, 300, 400x ARR, sometimes more, so the premium can be substantial. Is it warranted? We’ll know in the fullness of time. Not every company will be as successful as those who top the list in the charts above and achieve billions in revenue growing 70% or more annually. I wonder if it’s the right metric long term. Unlike the forward ARR valuation method, this technique doesn’t normalize for forward growth which means there’s information lost in the figure. Regardless, the 100x ARR multiple seems to be a benchmark in the industry today. It has some foundation in the public markets, but assumes quite a bit of forward execution.

Reversing a problem is a common mental model for thinking about a challenge in a novel way. Especially in investing. Google’s share price is $2863.55 as I write this. Is it a good price to buy? The traditional way of thinking would lead one to build a bottoms-up model with a few assumptions and compare the output to the price. But that approach ignores some critical information: the price. Price implicitly conveys the market’s expectations: how the company will grow, how valuable it will be, how strong the management team is. Most public companies are valued on the next ten years’ discounted cash flows. As Claude Shannon said, information is surprise . If instead, I start with the price and then build the model in reverse to compare the expectations of the market to my thoughts about the company, I quickly see whether my beliefs about a company differ from the market broadly. Michael Mauboussin’s Expectations Investing advocates reversing investment decisions this way: calculate the market’s expectations and line them up with yours to determine if you ought to invest. In other words, build the DCF to justify the price and then compare those assumptions to yours. Expectations investing is ubiquitous in Startupland, especially today when investors value exceptional startups at 100x ARR. Startups who command premium valuations have information baked in the price. Unlike the public market, which might constitute thousands or tens of thousands of entities pricing a stock, in Startupland, the valuation of a company can be set by a single investor, so perhaps there’s less information in a price.

We believe the 2020s are the decade of data. The trends are ubiquitous and plain. The number of data teams is growing as more companies rely on data for daily operations. In addition, the sophistication of these teams has progressed meaningfully in the last five years. During this period, there have been three main categories of data work: business intelligence, machine learning, and exploratory analytics. Of the three, exploratory analytics is the least developed so far. Jupyter Notebooks are often the tools of choice for exploration, but they suffer from notable shortcomings. Sharing is cumbersome, reproducing or rerunning analyses is brittle, and the technical barriers of adoption are needlessly high. Despite these rough edges, millions continue to use notebooks daily to analyze data. About 24 months ago, we met the Hex founding team: Barry , Caitlin , and Glen . From their experience at Palantir, they saw first-hand the challenges that organizations face when exploring data and collaborating with colleagues. They espoused a vision to rethink the notebook model and immediately captivated our imaginations. Hex combines the power of Python and SQL in the same notebook and empowers users to build
interactive apps that others can use. It serves the ‘analytically technical’—the tens of millions of potential data-centric users who struggle with the overhead of modern data analysis tools. Hex empowers them to spend less time dealing with unnecessary friction and more time doing impactful data work. The company has re-imagined how code notebooks should run, replacing the traditional kernel with what it calls the reactive data model . This architecture enables a technical analyst to seamlessly alloy data from different sources, collaboratively analyze the data with colleagues, and build interactive data apps to share with others. Imagine combining customer purchasing data from an API with customer web traffic data in a cloud data warehouse and running a clustering algorithm on the combined dataset. With Hex, I can ingest both data sets using SQL into a DataFrame, cluster the data with a Python library like scikit-learn, and share a link to an interactive customer segmentation dashboard I’ve just created with the sales and product teams. It’s a magical experience for any data aficionado. I’m thrilled to announce Redpoint’s partnership with Hex. Hex has seen extraordinary demand as a result of compounding insight for the millions of people working with data daily. We’re excited to work with them as they build the best exploration and collaboration tool for the analytically technical. If you’d like to try Hex, give it a spin here . And if you’re passionate about building the future of exploratory analytics, Hex is hiring .

co-authored with Patrick Chase We are thrilled to announce that Redpoint has partnered with Spot AI to lead their $20M Series A. Video cameras are everywhere: in warehouses, factories, car washes, hospitals, schools, banks, and stores. These cameras generate petabytes of data daily, but the software interfaces to access video today limit their use and value. Spot AI enables simple access to insight from video. Spot AI builds an artificially intelligent camera system that stores video, analyzes it, and enables collaboration across a team. Plus, it’s plug and play. Tanuj , Rish , and Sud , the founders of Spot AI, wanted the software to be easy to use, simple to install, and friendly to everyone, because they’ve seen customers struggle to access and leverage their video effectively. Spot AI makes it easy to not only view and share clips, but reveal insights about their businesses’ operations: warehouse utilization, vehicle locations, and customers entering storefronts. More than just transforming the user interface, Spot AI disrupts the purchasing process. Spot replaces the classic large-upfront capex spend with a modern software subscription. Every day cameras are getting, as Daft Punk would put it, “harder, better, faster, stronger,” while costing less. Spot AI’s disruptive model gives customers the freedom to choose their video hardware while providing ever-improving software, all with a lower total cost of ownership. To simplify purchasing further, Spot AI provides customers free cameras. We have eyed this $24B domestic market and $72B global market for a long time. Despite the UI challenges of incumbent solutions, their scale is a testament to the amount of customer demand. Legacy player Hikvision is worth $80B+ and there are unicorn startups including Verkada valued in the billions. The Spot AI team is impressive for their their speed of execution and willingness to make bold bets. In just a few quarters, the team have scaled the company and closed iconic customers like SpaceX, WineDirect, and Ruggable. We feel very fortunate to work with Tanuj, Rish, Sud and the entire Spot AI team on their mission to visually index the physical world and make that data useful to everyone at work. Run, Spot, run! If you’re curious about building the future of video intelligence and want to solve this problem alongside an exceptional team, Spot AI is hiring.

Crypto companies that launch a token maintain two capitalization tables: equity and token cap tables. They are distinct but related. Let’s look at a hypothetical crypto company’s cap tables. On the left, the cap table shows a company that has raised a Seed, A, B, and C rounds. In addition, there are allocations for the founders & employees, plus the Employee Stock Option Pool (ESOP) for new employee grants and retention grants. On the right is the token capitalization table. 55% of tokens is reserved for the community. This figure has evolved quite a bit in the last five years but let’s peg it at 55% for now. That leaves 15% for employees and founders, 15% for the treasury, and 15% for investors. These aren’t universal numbers because the “standard” terms are still coalescing in the market. Two things should jump out looking at the diagram. First, the community allocation dominates the token cap table. The community tokens incentivize network participants (validators/stakers) to jumpstart network effects. Second, crypto cap tables contain a new element not found in classic equity cap tables: the treasury. The treasury belongs to the foundation or corporate entity responsible for ongoing support of the project. The treasury captures tokens from the foundation’s efforts to participate in the community: running validators or stakers. Also, if the crypto company sells software/services to other crypto companies and receives payment in tokens, the token revenue generated from that relationship resides in the treasury. The treasury’s ownership is typically dictated by the equity cap table and distributed pro-rata across the equity cap table. In this case, founders and employees own 25% of the equity cap table. Ergo, they would own 25% x 15% = 3.75% of the token cap table. Those are straightforward observations from the diagram. However, there’s an additional question: how does the investor ownership in the equity cap table map to the investor ownership in the token cap table? Most deals are bespoke. Investor token ownership rights may take the form of a warrant in which equity investors have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase tokens at a discounted price to market in an early round. Some structures discount the investors’ allocation by a negotiated percentage: e.g., 66% warrant coverage per equity dollar invested. Lock-ups and holding periods also vary quite a bit. They span a few months to several years. Classic startup investing documents cohered around standards sometime in the late 2000s. The NVCA model documents and the YC standard SAFE documents . Crypto companies are still iterating and testing the key business terms of community and investor rights. Once those have settled, we may see standard crypto term sheets. But we’re not there yet.

Passive venture capital investing is a relatively new idea. But it’s transforming the industry. As later stage investors permeate venture capital, they are amassing index funds of startups. If the public equities market is any indication, passive investing is here to stay. In public equities, passive investment funds constitute 54% of total dollars in the market, according to Bloomberg Reseearch . Classically, venture capital has been an active asset class. Investors assume board seats and shoulder governance responsibility for the company, advise on strategy, introduce potential employees and prospective customers to the business, among other things. Most startups’ teams value these benefits in the earlier stages of a business when establishing product-market fit and developing a repeatable business. The latency to liquidity (IPO or M&A) has increased from 4-6 years to 11-13 years over the past two decades. In the later third or so of a company’s pre-exit life, active management is less relevant. The board is fully staffed, the executive team as well. Management teams resonate more with quick processes, large rounds, and a pattern of holding stocks through an IPO for a long duration; in other words, passive venture capital dollars. There isn’t a one-to-one mapping of growth capital and passive venture capital. Some growth funds, like Redpoint’s, provide active venture capital. But a significant and rising chunk of growth dollars will be passive as a share of the market. Why? Growth rounds are fewer in number but dwarf the round size of early-stage rounds by 10x or more. In addition, there are active index funds in the market: large volume incubators, for example. And early passive vehicles are just emerging as well, but are nascent. While there’s no analysis yet published on the split between active and passive management in the venture industry, there will be one. Will venture capital investment dollars be split 50/50 as the public equities market is? It’s too early to say. But this is yet another sign of the maturing of the venture capital industry as an asset class.

If you’re part of a management team, repeating yourself is a key to success. When I worked in online advertising, we measured the performance of marketing campaigns in a particular way called aided and unaided recall. Imagine I send you a survey with two questions: List the names of all the venture firms you’re aware of. Review this list of venture firm logos. Which ones do you know? The first question is an example of unaided recall and the second is aided recall. A quantitative brand marketer for Redpoint might send this survey before and after a campaign to measure the impact of the campaign. Great brands score very highly on unaided recall. The typical audience increases its unaided recall to a brand after roughly 7 impressions [1]. When selling a company, a product, or an idea to customers, employees, investors, candidates, repeating a consistent message several times embosses the message upon the individual’s memory. It establishes clarity: Redpoint is a leading venture capital firm. Great leaders coalesce their messaging around memorable, oft-repeated words. At Looker, Frank, the CEO, declared the Year of the Hound when the company’s strategic priority shifted from one buyer persona to another. Within the company, at board meetings, at our user conference, Frank and the Looker team talked about the year of the hound. All those brand impressions focused the company toward a single goal. That’s one example of using this principle to align a team. But it works just as well externally. Content marketing, brand advertising, videos, events, sales pitches, all hands, candidate interviews. All of these are opportunities for the next brand/message impression to reinforce aided/unaided recall. Repeating yourself improves brand recall. A simple message reiterated again and again is a powerful thing. [1] In practice, the number varies quite a bit. Researchers have modelled different patterns and Google employs dynamic frequency capping, which limits impressions, to maximize yield.

Unlike equity-only startups, crypto startups maintain two capitalization tables. The first is the equity cap table, just the same as non-crypto startup. The second is the token cap table: who owns how many tokens. In the early days of crypto, the convention for the genesis token distribution[1] was 80/20 community/insiders. Employees, investors, and the foundations responsible for running the projects (insiders) retained 20% of the tokens. At IPO for a classic startup, equity allocation is the reverse. Insiders own 80%. Why this allocation? The predominant sentiment was well articulated in a 2020 Messari Report on the state of L1s: Projects that distribute tokens to insiders (team, founders, and VCs) at the expense of the community put themselves at a disadvantage. The report continues. “Times have changed, and the ideal ratio is in flux.” Since the publication of the report, new projects have been increasing the insider share. Ethereum launched with 15% insider ownership almost 7 years ago. 4 years ago, TRON launched TRX at 26% and Tezos launched XTZ at 20%. The raft of L1s launching in the last 2 years have spanned 33% (DOT) to 48% (SOL). The most recent, FLOW is at 58% insider ownership. It’s important to note Flow is a child project of Dapper Labs with a different corporate structure than the others on the list. Regardless, the trend is broader than one business. Will insider ownership of crypto companies asymptote to a structure similar to post-IPO companies: insiders owning 80% on the day the IPO closes? Most companies sell about 20% at the IPO. The data suggests so. Are there any downstream effects? Let’s look at some select correlations for these tokens. Metric Correlation to Insider Ownership Notes Circulation -0.48 Fewer tokens to trade Market Cap Rank 0.30 Slight positive correlation to value LTM Performance -0.09 Uncorrelated with performance In short, fewer tokens circulate - logical since they are closely held. Second, insider ownership correlates to market cap, slightly. It would seem there’s no cap on upside with greater insider ownership. Most importantly, there’s zero correlation to last-twelve months’ token performance, suggesting the market doesn’t act any differently. Should this continue, we should expect the token cap tables of crypto companies to approach those of classical startups. Are there broader implications? The Messari report continues: But projects on the higher end of this scale will need to direct more resources towards optimizing for transparency and community-centric incentives to offset any centralization concerns. I’m curious to dive deeper to understand whether developer activity is correlated to genesis tokenomics. So far, I haven’t seen much to support a reversal in this trend, which could make investing in crypto companies much more similar to equity rounds, and invite more capital into the ecosystem. With greater ownership available for insiders, employees and investors will reap greater rewards. For investors, greater ownership reduces the exit value we underwrite in our investments. Of course, this is at the expense of the community. Ultimately, the kernel of the question underpinning these allocation decisions is: how much of the token cap table does the community need/want to participate at scale? We’re testing our way to the answer, edging closer by the year. [1] the distribution of tokens on the day they are created. This changes as network participants contribute to the network and are rewarded. Also, different networks have inflationary and deflationary policies which may change token counts.

Today, Height.app launched out of private beta, and we’re thrilled to announce Redpoint has partnered with the Height team, especially Michael & Kat, who hail from Stripe and Facebook. We were captivated by Height when we met the team several years ago. In particular, the company aspired to a vision of enabling cross-functional teams to work better together, particularly as organizations grow. The past two years have accelerated collaboration tools adoption and the moment is right for a new product to push the project management sector forward. I’ve been using the product for a bit and the product excels in the following ways: rich conversations remain within the context of tasks. This helps me understand the history of work streams and how decisions were made. the speed of the platform: relative to others Height is just faster. The command-K is very fast and the UI is lightning-quick managing projects across teams is much easier because of the underlying datamodel, but rather than explain it, the best way to understand how your day will change is to try it the ability to meld the product to different worflows while keeping enough of a structure to work with others across your organization. If you’re curious about the future of collaboration and want to solve the problem working alongside an exceptional team, Height is hiring .

The Modern Data Stack is taking shape. MDS is a movement led by many companies to re-architect data flows in an organization. The MDS is a reaction to the realization that data has become essential in every organization, but the tools, infrastructure, and culture to support that role aren’t yet in place. One of the key parts of that ecosystem is data observability: the system in the MDS that ensures data is correct and flowing properly. Monte Carlo, the leader in data observability, is hosting IMPACT:The Data Observability Summit, to hear from the leaders defining the most impactful evolutions in data. It’s a half-day event with some of the top minds in data including: DJ Patil: the first Chief Data Scientist of the US Neha Narkhede: a creator of Apache Kafka Bob Muglia: former CEO of Snowflake Max Beauchemin: founder of Preset, and creator of Airflow and Superset Amit Agarwal: CPO of DataDog Reynold Xin: co-founder of Databricks Zhamak Deghani: author of the DataMesh concept It’s rare to find such a broad cross-section of leaders sharing their views on the MDS. If you’re interested to attend, register here. The MDS is a trend Redpoint have been tracking very closely because we believe the 2020s are the decade of data, and we’ve partnered with many companies in this ecosystem including Snowflake, Monte Carlo, Dremio, Preset, and Transform, among others. This is an opportunity for data leaders to learn from the very brightest in the space.

GitLab is the first fully remote software company to go public. More than 2000 employees work all over the world and have collaborated to build a massive software business. GitLab provides a suite of DevOps tools that enable engineering teams to build and deploy software, and then secure it. The breadth of the solution is hard to convey, unless you visit the features page ; when printed it’s more than 100 pages long. If that’s not a suite… Founded ten years ago, the company has scaled rapidly selling their software management suite to small and large companies alike. Metric 2019 2020 Revenue, $M 81.2 152 Revenue Growth - 87.3% Gross Margin 88.4% 87.8% Sales Efficiency - 0.62 Net Income Margin -161% -120% Cash Flow from Operations Margin -74.0 -48.3% Net Dollar Retention 179% 148% Average Customer Value, $k 48.9 55.4 Customer Count 1662 2745 GitLab is the third fastest growing software company at IPO, registering 87% revenue growth in 2020, while charting 88% gross margins. This fabulously high gross margin results from many customers hosting their own GitLab suites. In other words, customers pay for their own hardware, rather than using GitLab’s cloud, which reduces the costs of goods sold and boosts gross margin relative to other cloud products. The sales efficiency of 0.67 implies a 17 month payback period with a contract size of $55k, but the S-1 suggests the enterprise part of the business has been an important focal point. Customers paying GitLab more than $100k have grown 75% year-over-year to 383. To achieve these incredible numbers, GitLab does burn quite a bit of money viewed both through the lens of accrual and cash accounting. Net Income Margin is -120% and Cash Flow from Operations Margin is -48%. The significant delta in the figures suggest customers pre-pay their contracts often. Using a basic linear regression model considering revenue growth and gross profit, the two factors most highly correlated with forward multiple, we should expect GitLab to trade around a 32x forward multiple. Assuming the company grows at similar levels to the first half of 2021, the model suggests the company should expect a market cap in the $15-17B range. Congratulations to the entire (distributed) team at GitLab on having developed a massively successful business.

Developer relations tops the list of priorities for many infrastructure companies. After all developer interest is a key step in the go-to-market motion. Many products enter an organization bottoms-up, and months or years later, become so important to the company, they buy a contract. How does a team scale and measure a devrel team? To answer that question, Redpoint Office Hours welcomes Shawn Wang , on Wednesday, September 22nd at 9:00 AM PT. Head of developer relations at Temporal , Shawn has worked on React and serverless JavaScript at Two Sigma, Netlify and AWS. He has started and run communities for hundreds of thousands of developers, like Svelte Society, /r/reactjs, and the React TypeScript Cheatsheet.
His nontechnical writing was also recently published in the Coding Career Handbook for Junior to Senior developers. In this session, my colleague, Sai Senthilkumar , will join Shawn to cover: The four pillars of developer relations Your north star for measuring the strength of your DevRel efforts How to successfully recruit the right developer relations team in this competitive environment If you’re interested in attending, please register here . This event will be interactive. We will collect questions from participants during registration and try to cover them throughout the discussion. Attendees will also have the opportunity to participate in a live Q&A at the end of the session. If you would like to stay notified of all future Office Hours, please subscribe here .

What is the product a customer or a prospect buys immediately before they buy yours? We’ve all heard the words digital transformation. Now that I’ve given you time to unroll your eyes and let the sarcastic comments dissipate, please give me a chance to make something useful of this idea. As a customer progresses along their journey, they evolve from a previous inferior state to a new superior one. The journey might be a migration from an on-premises data stack to a modern cloud data pipeline. Perhaps, they are in the midst of  modernizing their sales infrastructure from simply Salesforce to a broader suite of call recording, marketing attribution, and sales content enablement. A business could be migrating to a Kubernetes stack to power a microservices architecture with distributed tracing. For Looker, the preceding step was the adoption of a cloud data warehouse. By partnering with the newest generation companies like Snowflake and Google Big Query, and demoing with them, Looker’s product was part of a packaged pitch (data warehouse and BI together). At the end of many sales pitches, a prospect would say, “I’ll take it all.” Whatever the journey is, the customer isn’t purchasing just one solution to solve their needs. The typical mid-market company purchases 137 SaaS products, and the figure grows 30% annually . Companies collect tremendous amounts of software, and they layer it on top of one another to ascend a Maslow’s hierarchy of software needs until they reach actualization. Which is the rung of the software ladder immediately beneath yours? Whatever it is, those are the companies to partner with, develop technical integrations to accelerate adoption, co-sell and generally go-to-market alongside. After a prospect has adopted the software rung below yours, their eyes will rise to yours, and that’s your opportunity to win the great game of Risk played in software. . Position your startup to be there when they look to the future.

Imagine you have a dollar to invest and you can choose between two options: a public cloud service or a layer 1 blockchain. How do you decide which is more attractive? How does a token differ from equity? The answer is that tokens can act remarkably like equity if they are structured in the right way. In addition, tokens offer one benefit beyond equity: utility. Property/    Asset Voting Dividend Yield Minting Utility Value Driver Equity yes yes yes yes no revenue    /ebitda Token yes yes yes yes yes ? Here’s a table that summmarizes the similarities and differences of equity and tokens. They are in fact, very similar. Voting & Dividends Many of us have bought and sold equity; it’s familiar. If I buy one share of a public company stock, I can vote in the shareholder decisions and receive dividends if the board elects to issue one. A token provides voting rights when it is a governance token that governs a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) . A DAO is the governance organization of a crypto company. It functions like a board and shareholder base. A DAO manages the roadmap and the treasury of the business and evaluates ideas for the business that are submitted by the community. Should the DAO elect to distribute profits from the treasury, a token holder would receive a share of those earnings. Yield I can lend the stock to short sellers in a practice called securities lending for stocks . If a trader would like to short stock, they must borrow it from someone - me! For the service, the trader pays a me fee communicated as an interest rate. The same is true of tokens. Traders can borrow them to sell them short and pay a fee. Different tokens command different rates, like stocks. Minting A company’s board can create more stock simply by passing a motion. Poof! 10 million more Google shares. These new shares are often granted to employees as compensation. Tokens work similarly, though it’s called minting. If I work on behalf of a crypto company, I receive tokens as part of my compensation. But being an employee isn’t necessary to mint. I can also mint tokens if I participate in the network to help it along.  If I operate a Solana validator to verify transactions or buy a Helium router to distribute internet in my city or stake Ethereum to verify transactions, each network would reward me with tokens. The network pays members with tokens much the same way a corporations pays employees in stock. Public companies can choose to increase or decrease the number of shares outstanding through pool expansion or share buybacks. Tokens have their own mechanisms for controlling the total quantity of tokens. Some tokens are inflationary (over time each token is worth less) and others are deflationary (over times each token is worth more). The same could be said of company stock. For example, Apple is a deflationary stock. There are approximately 1/3 fewer shares of Apple in circulation today than in 2012 because the company has used their cash to buy them back and retire them. Utility Unlike equity, tokens have a utility. I can use a Ethereum token to transact: buy an NFT, sell an NFT, execute a Defi contract to exchange Compound tokens for Aave tokens for example. If I arrived at a Microsoft store seeking to buy an Xbox Series X with a two Microsoft shares, the clerk would be more than befuddled. To use my Microsoft stock and walk out of the store with the XBox, I’m required to swap my stock for US dollars and pay in cash or a credit card. Valuation Driver Most companies in the public market are valued on revenue or EBITDA; if revenue increases, so does the value of the stock. As for tokens, it’s an open question. The valuation methodologies haven’t coalesced yet. Cryptoassets written by Burniske and Tatar in 2017 contemplates a few different models including velocity of money (mv=pq), discounted future cash flows (DCF), and speculative value (if this asset is worth X, this other one must be worth y). There’s a great example for Axie here . But with significant differences in corporate structure (not all tokens provide DAO voting) differences in capital structure (does the value reside in the token or the equity of the cap table?), and the novelty that a token can be used as a utility in a way a stock cannot, the question is a perplexing one. Assuming a crypto company and its DAO decide to structure tokens as similar to equity as possible, then tokens confer one marginal benefit beyond equity: utility. That utility is worth something. It’s an option to act. It’s also a way to transact that may have less transaction costs than converting to cash or paying through a credit card network. Consequently, a token with the same rights as a share of a company should trade at a premium. The premium should be some combination of option value of the utility plus the discounted value of the tax and transaction cost savings. In addition, the different layers of the crypto stack will be valued differently. An automated market marker and an NFT market place have very different revenue, net income, and cash flow characteristics. The same is true for a crypto bank and an L1. How much for that Bizarden Tulip? As the market matures, valuation methodology will cohere into a well-understood framework, much as it has in SaaS over the last decade. But today, the ecosystem is most certainly using the speculative value method: if the floor price of a CryptoPunk is 20 ETH, then a Degenerative Ape must be at least 150 SOL. How much is a Bizarden Tulip NFT? [1] [1] this was the rarest tulip in Holland, yellow streaks on purple petals.

Amplitude, a leading provider of web analytics, filed their S-1 earlier this week. The company leverages novel storage techniques to scalably collect data on how users engage with mobile apps and web sites. Amplitude counts Cisco, Adidas, PayPal and CapitalOne amongst its customers. Amplitude offers three key products: analytics for measuring user behavior, experiment for testing new user flows, and recommendation which optimizes content for different user segments. Metric 2019 2020 Revenue, $M 68.4 102 Revenue Growth - 49.7% Gross Margin 67.7% 70.0% Sales Efficiency - 0.54 Net Income Margin -49.0% -24.0% Cash Flow from Operations Margin -23.4% -10.1% Net Dollar Retention 116% 119% Average Customer Value, $k 92.6 98.6 Customer Count 739 1039 Large Customer Contribution 71% 72% Amplitude’s revenue growth rate is in the top quartile for modern software companies at 49%. The summary statistics of the business reveal a company with a fairly high contract value of $98,600 and the largest customers generating 72% of revenue, putting the business squarely in the enterprise segment of SaaS companies. Both the ACV and large customer contribution are increasing with time suggesting the company continues to focus up-market. Amplitude has demonstrated improving efficiency characteristics across three key areas. The first is sales efficiency. The company spent $47m in 2019 on sales and marketing, and $52m in 2020, an increase of $3m or 6%, while growing revenues 49%. The 2020 sales efficiency is 0.54. Assuming current trends hold, sales efficiency in 2021 should nudge up to about 0.57. Impressively, Amplitude has charted an increasing growth rate in the first half of the year. Comparing the first half of 2021 to the first half of 2020, the company grew 57%, eight percentage points higher than the annual figures. This while improving profitability and cash flow margins. Similarly, net income margin (profitability) has increased from -49% to -24%. Cash flow from operations margin parallels the pattern, improving from -23% to -10%. Where will Amplitude trade? I prepared a linear regression model using the top two correlated factors to enterprise value to forward revenue multiple (EV/Fwd Rev). The model predicts the company will trade at 22x forward, implying an enterprise value in the range of $5.8 - $6.2B. Following the model of Asana, Slack, Spotify and others, Amplitude will conduct a direct listing on the day of their IPO. Congratulations to the entire Amplitude team on having built an impressive business and importantly the first publicly traded analytics company since Omniture debuted in 2006.

Should you price your SaaS per seat or per use? That was one of the salient questions Madhavan Ramanujam answered in last week’s Office Hours at Redpoint. Madhavan provided an excellent framework for answering this question, in addition to a multitude of other insights. The first thing to state is that massive companies have been built using both pricing structures: Salesforce and Adobe bill per seat while Snowflake and Twilio charge per use. Deciding which to use involves considering factors such as customer preference and competition. Many people think of pricing as monetization, but just as important to think through it as an acquisition strategy. Here’s a simplified 2x2 matrix to distill some of the ideas we discussed. Value/ Usage Intermittent Steady Intermittent per use n/a Steady per seat depends When to use per seat pricing If your customers demand predictable bills, then per seat pricing is the way to go. The question is do they prefer it or do they demand it? Most customers will prefer predictability, but won’t necessarily demand it. Would they switch if the pricing weren’t predictable? That’s a question worth examining in your pricing research. If you would like to create switching costs, per seat pricing with annual contracts establishes some lock-in. Usage pricing provides more flexibility to customers to try alternatives. When to use usage based pricing If your costs are material and scale with usage like Twilio, then usage based pricing aligns your costs with your customers’ spend. This prevents very large customers from being your worst customers, by generating lots of revenue, but costing you money because the account is gross-margin negative. If you are pursuing a two step go-to-market strategy with which the first user has a low willingness to pay, but the ultimate buyer has a larger budget, consider usage pricing. This is a land-and-expand motion. But, don’t give the farm away with the first product. One of the most memorable parts of the session is when Madhavan shared with us that the most common pricing mistake in a land and expand motion is to cede too much value in the free/lesser product, scuttling any expansion opportunity. If customers use the product intermittently and the value is intermittent, usage based pricing works well. A hybrid approach There are many companies who employ a two-part tariff: a base platform fee and an ongoing usage fee to capture positive aspects of both types of pricing strategies. Segment is a good example of this. The platform fee establishes a stable relationship and the usage pricing enables the customer to scale up or down as a function of their traffic which might vary throughout the year. Competition Sometimes, entering the market with a different pricing model disrupts incumbents. Michelin developed a much more durable tires. Taking it to market with the existing pricing model would have meant cannibalizing sales. So the company evolve to selling tire miles to truckers who preferred this model because they could pass the cost on to their customers. Those are some of the chestnuts from the session, and they provide a rough framework. The most common question in the session was: how to determine the right pricing strategy for my start-up? In chapter 4 of Monetizing Innovation, Madhavan prescribes the questions to ask, the kinds of customers to solicit, and the analyses to be done to drive to the right conclusion. I’m grateful to Madhavan for joining us and sharing his insights, and for the audience’s participation in this very popular session the most vexing topic for startups.

Visit any website today and you’ll likely be accosted from the front and mugged from the back. The first thing you’ll see, aside from the website’s masthead, is ubiquitous and maddening cookie declaration asking you whether you object if the website sells your data. The overt mugging. Meanwhile, third party data siphoned from your behavior on other sites catalog your preferences, your movements, and your purchases. This information is traded on exchanges around the world. The covert pilfering. This is my web experience. By the way, I helped create it. I was part of a product team that built infrastructure to monetize users’ movements. And I see now it won’t last. Recently I visited a website where I spent a significant sum, but the website never knew who I was. No cookies, no log-in, no username, no password. Each subsequent time I visit the website, the application treats me as if it’s the first time we’ve met. It’s a goldfish - its memory lasts less than five seconds. Ted Lasso would approve . Most web3 apps work this way. In my case, the app is Raydium , a place to buy and sell crypto. When I arrive, I can browse it freely, anonymously. When I want to transact, I connect to the app with a Chrome extension, a wallet . The wallet secures my identity, my data, and my money. When I consent, my wallet submits an ID to Radium which suffices to move money around securely. When I leave the webpage, I disappear into the good night , at least as far as Raydium is concerned. Technically, Radium is a dApp (distributed app), but that moniker will soon fade away, just the same as portal and webapp have dissipated in the fullness of time, replaced by the simpler site or app. Many web3 or dApps are built this way. Wallet-based authentication will dominate in the next decade because it puts the user in control, where we want to be. The wallet replaces the username, the password, and the cookie. As the CEO of one of the largest internet companies in the world used to say: focus on the user, and all else will follow. Web3 authentication is simpler. And everyone who has deployed security tools in the past will tell you, simplicity wins every time. Users prefer it.

There’s a simple secret to hiring quickly and building a strong team. Invest in great managers early. Let’s compare the organizational chart of two different startups. On the left, the startup is flat. There is a single leader, with a handful of individual contributors. On the right, the company structure is a classic hierarchy. When startups start, they tend to look like the company on the left. There might be a few founders who lead, rather than the one depicted here. But most people are individual contributors. They write code, author blog posts, publish the website, attract customers, with the goal of achieving product-market fit. Post-PMF, the organization must evolve: it has to grow headcount and then manage that headcount well. How many hiring managers are in each of the two hierarchies from above? On the left, there’s one. On the right, three. The structure on the right divides the recruiting work in thirds. With the flat structure, we have a single leader who carries the entire recruiting burden on their shoulders. This is a simple example to prove the point. As a business scales, the company benefits from a layer of managers to distribute the recruiting burden. In addition, when you hire an executive, you’re hiring a network . More hiring managers implies a broader pool of candidates to fish. Once those hiring managers hire a team, the responsibility to manage people begins. The same story is true between the left and right structures. Our GTM survey found sales teams with spans of control consistently outperform teams with spans of control greater than 7. The benefits of smaller teams are real. Team leads or hiring managers can originate from outside or inside the company. Most companies try to maintain something like a 50/50 blend or so (roughly). Because talent is the most valuable part of a startup and also the greatest cost (recruiting and salaries), investing in the infrastructure to attract and retain talent is good business. Of course attrition is part of startups, with many businesses observing 15-20% annual attrition. Consequently, recruiting numbers should be about 1.25x the actual number of seats to fill, including hiring managers. It’s easy to miss that detail when building a headcount plan. People managers in startups distribute the recruiting and retention work over more people, enabling the company to scale faster, and more efficiently by reducing retention.

Pricing is one of the questions that persist through the evolution of a company. A common topic today in software startup board rooms is: should the company price by seat or by usage? To answer this question and many others, Redpoint Office Hours will welcome Madhavan Ramanujam , Partner and Board Member at Simon-Kucher on Wednesday, August 25th at 11AM PT. Madhavan has led more than 200 pricing projects across software companies. He has advised more than 20 unicorns including Uber, Asana, and Stripe. He is the co-author of Monetizing Innovation , which I wrote about in this blog post . It’s the canonical book on modern pricing. During the session, we’ll cover: the types of pricing strategies the key factors to think about when pricing when to employ usage and seat based pricing how to communicate pricing changes If you’re interested in attending, please register here . We will collect questions from participants during registration and try to cover them throughout the discussion. Attendees will also have the opportunity to participate in a live Q&A at the end of the session. If you would like to stay notified of all future Office Hours, please subscribe here .

A venture dollar’s velocity has never been faster. The time it takes for a dollar to appear in an LP’s pocket, for the LP to wire it to a VC fund, and for the VC fund to invest can be measured in minutes. Then, hold your breath for the pre-emptive round, and you’ll have 3 term sheets before you pass out. I’m kidding of course, but the hyperbole illustrates the velocity of money in Startupland. I’ve never seen a dollar move faster. What’s driving this? Just look at these numbers in the exit markets. Startups are basking in the IPO market. They’ve raised 3x as much year-to-date in IPOs as all of 2020, which was a healthy market. Where will the tally end the year? $100B+? 120B+? See that blip in 2012? That was the Facebook IPO. The M&A market is not far behind; it’s on track to double 2020’s decade high of M&A value transacted. With liquidity figures rocketing into space alongside Branson and Bezos, it’s no surprise to see the market behave this way. VC fundraising will achieve a record. Valuations are at decade highs . There are 3-5 financings and M&A every working day. There’s an IPO every fourth or fifth day. I wrote a post in 2015 called The Runaway Train of Late Stage Fundraising that examined the disparity between the number of growth rounds and unicorns versus the number of IPOs. If this year has shown us anything, it’s that the IPO and M&A markets have risen to the challenge; they’ve swelled to accommodate the team of unicorns born in the last decade. And there’s nothing more enticing to an investor to double down and move money faster than gains.

A few years ago, when a startup raised a Series A or Series B, founders would bolster the round with venture debt: a term loan and/or a revolving credit line. However, equity dollars are replacing those debt dollars in the last 18 months in the early stage. Meanwhile, venture debt dollars have migrated to later stages. Early stage debt origination and round counts peaked in 2019, while later stage debt has increased quite nearly every year. In the later stages, debt is often used to finance acquisitions, and perhaps this is occurring more for venture backed companies. Why has venture debt shifted later? The cost of capital in the early stage has fallen dramatically in the last six months, i.e., valuations in the early stage have close to doubled . With an increase in valuation, there’s a concomitant increase in round size. Startups that used to raise $8m on $40m might raise $15m at $80m. The round size is twice the size and the equity dilution is less (20% vs 18.8%). Flush with cash, why raise debt at the early stage? Though salaries and other costs have increased significantly during this period, round size inflation outstrips these costs, so one should expect startup balance sheets to be relatively stronger than the same business a year ago. In addition, startups raise bigger rounds earlier in their lifecycles, which may be more challenging for venture lenders to underwrite. Last, there are new financing options for factoring receivables for startups. Other startups advance cash on SaaS contracts or ad spend, which are alternatives & competitors to venture debt. Given the amount of capital available at the early stages, founder preferences for financial products is changing, and this is yet another example. Data credit: Pitchbook

One of the most exciting trends in data, during this Decade of Data, is the evolution of the open ecosystem. Around the new Cloud Data Lakes an ecosystem is blossoming, bursting with new concepts for the future of data. The third Subsurface conference takes place this week, July 21-22, to delve into some of these topics. Here are some of the highlights: Zhamak Dehghani invented the concept of the Data Mesh. Data meshes recast data teams inside companies; instead of a single team producing data for a company, decentralized teams publish and consume data from other teams, paralleling the move to microservices from monoliths in infrastructure software. Novel data management projects like Apache Iceberg and Project Nessie are fundamental advances in how to manage, control, and serve data in the data mesh architecture. Ryan Blue and Ted Gooch will share the story behind Apache Iceberg at Netflix and Ryan Murray, one of the creators of Nessie, will announce some new advances that enable Git-like functionality for data. Amazon’s S3 stores and Azure’s data stores provide the infrastructure for teams to maintain and control data. Amazon S3 GM Kevin Miller and Microsoft VP PM of Azure Storage will share the future of cloud storage If you’re interested in how Cloud Data Lakes and Data Meshes are evolving, and in the future of data, register for Subsurface here

It’s not very often one meets someone with Padmasree Warrior ’s story. Formerly the CTO at Motorola, she left to co-lead Cisco’s engineering organization worldwide. Next, she took the helm at NIO, a manufacturer of automonous vehicles that went public in 2018. She serves on the boards of Microsoft and Spotify. On Wednesday, July 28 at 12pm PT, Redpoint Office Hours welcomes Padmasree, who is current the CEO of Fable ,the social reading platform that brings stories for everyone, anywhere. My partner, Annie Kadavy , will host Padma to learn about Padma’s preference for taking the opposite path, sharing lessons she’s learned from leading a Fortune 100 company, and bringing the Journey full circle by starting a company from scratch.

Today, Jim Benton, CEO at Chorus announced the company has agreed to a merger with ZoomInfo for $575m . I remember meeting Roy Raanani, Chorus’ founder, more than 5 years ago, when he demoed the company’s ability to analyze voice conversations in real-time, extracting words, detecting inflections in speakers’ affects, and synthesizing understanding from sine waves to assist account executives. It was revolutionary. We connected on a shared interest in speech recognition technologies and decided to partner over a dinner at a steakhouse in the Union Square neighborhood of San Francisco. So much has happened since then. Chorus helped create the Conversational Intelligence software category that evolved from AI curiosity to must-have for modern sales leaders. The company won over customers like Zoom, MongoDB, Bill.com, Adobe, Docusign, among many others. Along the way, Jim Benton joined the business as CEO, accelerating our go-to-market, sharing insights with key sales leaders on The Weekly Briefing , and leading the company to this terrific outcome. Congratulations to the entire Chorus team today, on a great outcome, and achieving yet another milestone in the journey to bringing Conversational Intelligence to every person in a go-to-market role!

How does crypto work at the highest level? This is the mental model I’ve been using. There are six key categories of players. Asset acquirers - these include brokerages, custodial and non-custodial wallets, banks, asset managers, hedge funds, market makers, and lenders. They aim to acquire assets to plunge into the crypto ecosystem. Each acquirer offers a unique value proposition, tempting investors to park cash with them. These companies might target retail or institutional investors, hawk loans, offer trading of varied assortments of tokens, compete on lower trading fees, share better market information, or reward loyalty with their own token. Many in this group attract investors/users with high interest rates for deposits, which are funded by lending assets to other market participants. Then they plan to cross-sell other financial products, much like a modern bank or brokerage. Protocols - Protocols are invented, created, designed, and managed by organizations and companies. Protocols are computer programs that decide how digital assets should behave. These assets might be coins, tokens, NFTs and be used in different ways. Tokens might be used as stores of equity value, as a replacement for government money, to pay for a particular service, or simply as as collectible. In the language of the land, the protocol is often called a smart contract. Smart contracts are open-source. There product-minded protocols to enable NFTs which confer unique ownership of an asset within that protocol’s ecosystem, and financially-focused protocols that enable futures and swaps, even perpetual swaps (perps) and new kinds of financial products, amongst others. Exchanges - exchanges are the marketplaces where people trade tokens to determine their value. Exchanges come in two flavors. There are centralized exchanges which swap tokens between two participants on the same exchange. And there are DeFi exchanges, short for decentralized finance, which enable trades of tokens between two people directly without an exchange in the middle. Think eBay vs Craigslist for crypto and you’ll have the gist. Chains - these are the databases storing transactions executed on exchanges. There are many chains. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses that span attributes like speed, privacy, cost to write transactions, and developer friendliness. Protocols must decide which chain(s) they will support. The same is true for exchanges. Because different tokens support different chains, there are network effects at play. The more developers on a chain, the more transactions on that chain, the greater the attractiveness to future developers and end users. There are L1 chains and L2 chains. L1 chains provide the global public consistent database. L2 chains sit on top of L1 chains where they provide better performance and reduce the operational costs of the database. There are also groups working on enabling cross-chain compatibility. Miners/Stakers - the big idea in crypto is that all transactions in chains should be public and that no one entity should control the database. This is a hard problem to solve. Most databases today are centralized. For a public globally distributed database to function, computers must perform complex and computationally expensive math to ensure the transactions are consistent and accurate across all the database nodes. Meanwhile, the database is changing every minute, so this math is ongoing. There are different ways of verifying that the transactions sent to the database are accurate, for example, proof of work or proof of stake. In both cases, a person seeking to transact must pay to authenticate the transaction to a group of miners or stakers, people who own computers and perform this math for a fee. Software vendors - a software ecosystem is blossoming around crypto. Software spans many categories. Information brokers to help traders understand market trends, compliance tools, tax software, protocol debugging tools, even smart contract insurance. There is also a category called oracles which provide API endpoints to supply smart contracts with data. Unfortunately, the ecosystem isn’t as neat as this list might imply. Many exchanges also are in the business of asset acquisition, protocol creation, and chain operation. Some wallets offer their own protocol token. It’s messy, which makes it fun to figure out. Even better, this ecosystem moves blindingly fast. It has the 24h clock of a modern international financial market blended with the innovation of brilliant developers authoring open source software. I’m sure this mental model has its flaws. Let me know how you think about the ecosystem and where this construct falls short of reality. I’m eager to learn more.

Alfred Winslow Jones created the first hedge fund in 1949. He pioneerd the idea of hedging to maximize gains, trading based on stock movements which he called velocity, paper portfolios and a competitive multi-manager model in which individuals ran their own books. Since that era, hedge funds have innovated roughly every decade or so. More Money than God illuminates each epoch. In the 1960 post-war boom, pension funds entered the primarily retail-driven market. Bigger orders created inefficiencies in the market, and a fund named Steinhardt, Fine, Berkowitz arbitraged the illiquidity created by big blocks to great success by buying large share blocks at discounts. During the 1970s stagflation reigned and commodities soared. With that backdrop, the first quant funds formed to forecast price swings in commodities and capitalize on correct calculations.  Using large volumes of data collected by hand in the cocoa markets of Africa for example, econometricians developed models and reshaped investing. George Soros embodied the rise of global-macro investing in the 1980s & 1990s. Betting on currency movements, he and Stanley Druckenmiller “broke the Bank of England.” With a group of other funds, Soros and Druckenmiller leveraged their investment to force the Bank of England to abandon the currency peg they had established as part of the European Exchange Rate mechanism, generating $1b in
gain on one trade. The dot-com bubble in 2000 ravaged many of the winners in the 80s and 90s, including Julian Robertson’s Tiger Global, another major global macro investor on par with Soros’ Quantum Fund. However, it sparked a new wave of quantitative investing. Quant evolution continued throughout and led to the marvel of Renaissance Technologies Medallion fund which has recorded better
than 40% returns for decades. Today, we see many hedge funds pursuing the next market opportunity: late stage venture and crypto, taking many of the learnings from the past few decades to arbitrage illiquid markets, geopolitical events, and quantitative insights for gains. And without a doubt, these firms will continue to innovate and push the market forward. Between the lines of this history, there’s an ongoing debate of whether the successes of these hedge funds negate the efficient market theory, that all information is priced in and active management underperforms in the long term. Regardless, the history of hedge fund industry is a fascinating one that shows how investors have innovated over decades.

Suppose you’ve started a company that’s creating a category. Most buyers in your target market haven’t heard of your business or the kind of software you sell. There’s no budget line item, no Magic Quadrant, no G2 High Performer Award, no conference. You have an idea, a vast blue ocean in front of you, and a pile of greenbacks stashed in a bank account from your last financing. Do you spend aggressively to create the category or conserve capital, knowing education will take
time? Parsimony is prudence. New categories form at unpredictable rates because each market has distinct nuances. But is frugality a winning strategy in any of those spaces? In this fundraising environment, I’ll argue probably not. There’s no time to wait. The company that develops the greatest of customer relationships in the first few years is often the winner. While it’s apparent that customer relationships provide product feedback and revenue, and more of each is better, there’s another critical reason customer relationships are so key. The first company to reach a prospect frames the buyer’s lens for a long time. The features that matter, the price point and pricing model, insufficiencies in competitors’ offerings. Each subsequent bidder for the business must either conform to that mental model and spar for position within its confines, or exert enough energy and spend enough money to challenge and subvert the first framing. That’s a tall order, and exactly the position a startup should wish upon
its competitors. I’ve watched buyers in new categories. They prefer the best known brand, the one synonymous with the category. They will work with the leader for a few years before deciding to re-evaluate if things aren’t going well, justifying a change with the attitude: “I’m working with the leader in a new category, let’s see how things evolve.” Imagine a big map of customers, a huge game of Risk. Each time a customer buys software, its color changes and it’s off limits for 3 years. Marketshare in the first 1-3 years dictates marketshare for years 4-6 at least. The more customers you convert to your company’s color, the stronger the brand, the greater the awareness, the more reference customers, the more capital to raise, the easier to hire and grow. There’s a flywheel spinning in the background that isn’t obvious until the latter stages of category creation. The winner takes most of the spoils. Product matters. It has to work and deliver value. Distribution is at least equally and probably more important because of this Risk-territory dynamic in new category creation, especially in a market environment with so much cash available.

Are we more productive at the office or at home? Researchers from the University of Chicago published data on the productivity trends across 150,000 employees of a large IT services company to answer that question. It’s the first time I’ve seen analysis on the same business through the period. The business had deployed software to monitor employee behavior before COVID and used it throughout. Quoting from the paper: WFH reduced total commuting time among US workers by more than 60 million hours. So, did we accomplish more by commuting to our kitchen counter instead of the office park? Location Hours Worked per Day Output Productivity Office 5.08 100.82 1.36 Home 7.04 100.30 1.11 Workers accomplished the same amount but spent 2 hours more per day (7h vs 5h) at the office. So despite a reduction in commute hours, this company’s productivity declined (defining productivity as output per hour.) Activity WF Office WF Home Working hours 44.7 49.3 After hours 9.64 12.98 Focus hours 34.49 32.73 Collaboration hours 10.2 11.07 Manager meetings 3.97 5.48 Emails 23.6 25.26 Let’s get more granular. When working from home, employees spend 5h per week more working, more after hours, with fewer focus hours, more meetings with managers, and more time on email. But that’s not the final word. Here’s the tricky part: the standard deviations on these figures are substantial. For example, focus hours have standard deviations of 9.2 and 9.9. What does that mean? In short, the data isn’t strong enough to make a case that WFO is superior to WFH (working-from-home) or vice-versa. The research delves into other topics including the impact of children on men’s and women’s productivity working from home, differences for managers and individual contributors’ productivity, and fluctuations in internal and external meeting volumes that are worth exploring. This is the first report of undoubtedly many on the subject. The tradeoffs between different environments will be debated often in the next few years by executives and people leaders globally. The data isn’t clear; there’s just too much variance to draw broad conclusions on whether the office or home are more productive from this analysis. Rather than asking broadly which venue is better, we might ask which is better when and for whom? In short, the optimal answer is nuanced, and likely team-specific rather than a blanket policy. Both systems can work. But they might require different management techniques and styles.

This weekend, Janet Yellen said the US economy would benefit from an increase in interest rates . The Fed has been struggling to combat historically low inflation. The combination of both the 25% increase in the money supply from last year’s stimulus plus the proposed infrastructure spending should trigger inflationary pressures. What does it mean for venture capital and Startupland? In short, we should expect some cooling. Let’s examine the relationship between total venture capital investment and the 10 year Treasury in some detail. The x-axis plots yield of the 10 year Treasury (average for the year). The y-axis tracks enture capital investment by year and the year of the data point resides in the reddish circle. Our story starts in the bottom right of corner in the year 2000 with 6% interest rates and $18.2b of VC. Over time, rates decline and then in the 2012-2014 era, they begin to surge upward culminating 6-8 years later at the top-left of the chart and $200b+ invested. Do you remember this shape from high school math? It’s a rectangular hyperbola and it suggests a relationship of y = A/x^n, which is exactly the net present value formula’s form . In other words, the market is acting according to theory. As the interest rate approaches zero, venture capital spend approaches infinity. Given the pace of investment and valuations in Startupland, it sure feels like there’s infinite capital in the market. Mean round sizes and deal counts when plotted against the 10 year yield also reveal rectangular hyperbolas. This phenomenon isn’t limited to venture capital; PE demonstrates the same rectangular hyperbola, but the PE chart is smoother, implying the market responds more quickly to changes in rates than venture capital. Here’s the bottom line: as interest rates increase, we should expect venture capital investment to regress. When the cost of capital is low and yields on cash are small, investors seek greater risk to attain a return. As the risk-free rate on Treasuries increases, market forces should engender enough friction to pull venture investment from the stratosphere into the troposphere or below. The next question on our lips ought to be: how quickly will the friction appear? There are arguments on both hands. For a speedier correction: the recent volatility of the public technology markets, the presence of public investors in private markets, the fact that relationship between rates/risk is well-known amongst investors. On the other hand, venture markets have always been slow to respond to public markets, the charts above show quite a few years of latency between a fall in rates and an increase in spend, and venture funds are raised to be invested over years; all of which should mute some of the impact. If you’re looking for one-handed economist like an exasperated President Truman , I’ll give you my view. I suspect the correction influenced by rates takes a few years to percolate through Startupland. As rates increase, the tide of venture dollars will inexorably ebb. PE’s relationship with rates seems more straightforward, and this makes sense given the LBO (leveraged buy-out) requires significant debt. Bond yields govern the price of loans, so the impact of higher rates on PE costs/returns is direct and immediate. This is why all investors’ eyes are trained on inflation and Treasury yields. These numbers move markets.

The cost of a failed account executive hire is about 8 months of lost productivity . A three month initial search, three months of ramp time, the termination, and then another two to three months of ramp for their replacement. That’s at the individual contributor level. What does it cost the organization to hire the wrong executive? In terms of time cost to the startup, a failed executive hire is roughly similar, 9 months. But knock-on effects hinder the organization. First, there’s the execution delay to a company. When a company hires an executive, the business hires the executive’s network . Great executives will staff a team quickly. Because that team often shares work history, the success rate of that team is higher than average. The converse is also true. Executives with weak networks burn time to build their teams. Without a strong network, those executives’ success rate in building their team will asymptote to the average. Hiring takes longer and is less fruitful. The second knock-on effect is attrition. Letting go of the wrong leader often means rebuilding their team under new management. Attrition challenges the culture of an organization, the perception of momentum, the motivation of surrounding teams. Most companies observe about 15% attrition annually. Those without the right leaders observe significantly more. The third impact is damage to the employer brand. That’s a reason the Redpoint SaaS metrics template includes Glassdoor score . In a slight revision, some companies added Glassdoor page views, a proxy for candidate interest in a company. The better the management hires for a business, the greater candidates’ interest to work for a company. Often, employee satisfaction follows (also a metric
in the template). These figures translate into candidate close rates and candidate cycle length. The greater the demand to work at a company, the faster teams staff roles with stronger candidates. In addition to the lost time and execution of a failed executive hire, employee churn increases, employee tarnishes, and overall employee satisfaction suffers. Startups that pick the right leaders to build their company benefit from a competitive advantage for all these reasons. Startups should expect successful management hires about 75% of the time. However, some executive teams observe very little turnover. Looker was one of those examples. The management team at the time of the sale to Google collaborated for 5 years without turnover. Of course, the team grew as the business did. Regardless, the shared culture and consistency of the team was a strength for the business, and ultimately a competitive advantage in execution time, culture, and employee brand.

Over the last ten years, the 75th percentile post-money valuation of a cloud software or infrastructure company has grown 11% annually. In 2021, the post-money valuation has spiked 60% from $48.1m to $77.0m. While not as hyperbolic an inflation rate as copper or lumber, the price trajectory of early stage cloud startups does result from a similar supply demand/imbalance. And this isn’t the first time annual valuation deltas have touched this magnitude. I’ve plotted the post-money valuations for US cloud and infrastructure companies above for the Series A. Each of the three quartiles have inflected in the first 5 months of this year. The seed market compounds at a higher rate over the same decade at 15%. But it hasn’t soared like it’s older brother in 2021, preferring a more consistent path. If we plot the annual growth rates for the 75th percentile Series A, we observe the expansion in valuations occurs in fits and starts. 3 of the 11 years recorded 40%+ growth. 3 of the years saw declining prices. Perhaps these prices are tied to blockbuster IPO markets. 2012: Facebook. 2014: Alibaba. 2021: Snowflake (late 2020), UIPath, Airbnb, Doordash, Coinbase. Or there’s always the definitional argument to be made: the Jacobs ladder in which Series A is the new Series B and seed is the new Series A. But there’s more to this trend than just nomenclature change. The market feels different. Investment processes last a few days. Preemptive rounds have become a norm. Straight to Series A (skipping the seed) isn’t uncommon, particularly in infrastructure or open source commercialization  efforts. Pricing rounds on multiples like public market investing. Vibrant secondary markets. Index investing and the entrance of hedge funds. That’s the demand side. But the supply side of the market has evolved just as much. Founders’ sophistication has increased in the US - and also globally. Many run auctions effectively, and pick the right partner conducting similar diligence to the investors themselves. Rather than burn dictating when to raise capital, founders elect to raise when inbound interest arrives, or immediately before launching to sell the dream rather than the metrics, or at other strategic inflection points. The conversation
of how long capital will last, which was ubiquitous is mostly debating during seed rounds, if at all. This has as much to do with novel GTM strategies, better product-market fit, and the consequent greater leverage in businesses, as does the demand side. A few years ago, raising a large venture round anointed a winner. Balance sheets swelled to permit management teams offensive and defensive options. Today, large rounds and unicorn valuations are (and this might sound jaded) expected, normal, part of the game. As often happens in financial markets, players find an edge, exploit it, and in time the players copy it in aims of achieving the same success. Is it good for the market or bad for the market? That’s the wrong question. It’s tough for buyers and great for sellers. Founders have access to more capital, faster, and more consistently than they ever have. The market rewards those with big ideas and momentum, earlier and earlier. The game on the field has changed in the last year. The data is a lagging indicator, but it does show how quickly and how significantly pricing has skyrocketed, the effect of evolution in both supply and demand in the venture capital marketplace.

This summer, startups will define how they return to work. In talking to founders and executives, I suspect the answer isn’t universal. But the force that will shape the decision is universal. That force is competition. A startup has three main activities: (1) recruit a team to (2) build a product and (3) sell and service the product. Competition influences each of those functions. Recruitment . Most people in Starupland spend more time looking for a parking space than for a job. The market is that competitive. To differentiate, employers find new ways of enticing the best people to come work for them. But employee preferences vary. Some prefer fully remote, others part-time remote, and the remainder full-time office work. Startups will need to decide which of these three options they offer and to whom: which teams, levels of seniority, and geographies. But, in the end,
competition in the hiring market may require most larger companies to provide all three options to maximize their recruiting success. I suspect a significant fraction of the real estate budget will be funneled into employee salaries and periodic travel, and potentially smaller regional offices. Product development . The Iron Triangle of product management says you can have two of these three: high speed, high quality, or low cost. Which does a team sacrifice when it’s remote vs in-person? The OG (original gangster/old guard) remote-first companies structured themselves as distributed to wield a recruiting advantage. Modern companies distribute their teams to develop regional centers for developing a portion of a product: machine learning, algorithms, connectors, front end development. They match the needs of the business to local talent pools. In other words, labor market arbitrage, something that has been occurring since at least 2017 . Each startup will need to decide: do the recruiting and cost advantages of distributed teams outweigh the higher communication overhead and management work? The nature of competition in each segment will determine this. Less competition affords a startup more time to focus on quality and cost. More competition implies speed trumps other concerns and in person is the better set up. Sales and service . The pandemic accelerated the decade old movement to the cloud. Video-based selling became the norm, and so did deployment, configuration, and training. The question on every salesperson’s mind today is: will selling in person reprise its role as a competitive advantage? We’ve shown there’s no need to be at a place to sell effectively: sales efficiencies steadfastly persisted at previous levels through the past year . However, account executives do need at least one more call to close that deal . Though we understand sales efficiency, we haven’t answered the question, how does pressing flesh influence conversion rates now that it’s possible again? Should the data show a meaningful lift, competitive pressures will compel AEs to travel again. As with every decision in business, this one is all about tradeoffs. What does a management team trade off to develop the sharpest competitive edge? The universal force of competition should be the lens teams use to decide how to structure their businesses post-vaccine.

Startups used to raise once every 18 months. Today, we joke in Startupland that a startup is never raising and always raising. The implication is the most sought after companies often receive offers, whether they are in market raising capital or not. Take a moment to think through that statement with me. Venture capitalists and boards used to value a company every 18 months. Then, every 12 months. Now every 6 months or every 3 months some startups receive termsheets valuing their business. We, as an industry, are marking-to-market much more frequently than we used to. If things continue as they are, the venture capital ecosystem will mimic the stock market, which marks companies to market every minute. Just kidding. I can’t see that happening for a number of reasons, but the trend is real: with more dollars to invest, the market is becoming much more liquid. Access is the scarcest resource in Startupland , the access to buy shares of hypergrowth startups. At the same time, venture capital fundraising sets records each year. Facing scarce access to startups, but bountiful billions burning a hole in our wallets, investors are innovating. The pre-emptive round started a few years ago. Excited about a business, and the company isn’t raising till next year? Research them ahead of their process and present them with a term sheet next week. Entice them to skip the process with a healthy forward multiple. Then, secondary programs emerged. Facing 11 years to IPO rather than 4 years two decades ago, startup employees began clamoring for some liquidity as a company matured. Initially, these secondary sales were occasional transactions, but as demand swelled on the buy and sell sides, today many late stage companies provide liquidity on a regular basis empowering employees to swap shares for dollars with secondary buyers. Next, the Special Purpose Acquisition Company boom. The recipe for a SPAC is just like baking a cake. Raise some dough, let it rest for bit while you hunt for an exciting company, fold an exciting startup into the mix, and once the baking soda has done its work, put the package in a hot oven (public market) and watch it rise. The direct listing, another financial innovation, relies on by pre-emptive private rounds to eliminate the need for raising capital at IPO, while simultaneously assuaging concerns over fees and mispricing (the IPO pop phenomenon). The most recent innovation: the venture capital index fund. Hedge funds have entered the market in 2020, participating in upwards of 60% of all transactions to create an index of mid-and-late stage venture capital. 30% more dollars exist today than 18 months ago. Technology companies are fueling much of the growth in key economies, but access to those businesses is limited. When you have a supply/demand imbalance like this one, the financial markets innovate to trade dollars for shares in creative ways. There are second-order effects of these market dynamics. Valuations and round sizes have ballooned. Competition reinforces the importance of differentiation in the market. Venture capital funds, which used to raise every 3 years, now raise every 12-18 months to keep up with the pace of the game on the field. In the middle of the maelstrom, founders enjoy simpler and faster fundraising processes on better terms. Stanley Druckenmiller once said, “It’s liquidity that moves markets.” The tsunami of cash in the private markets has hurtled the venture capital industry forward with at least five key innovations.

Data privacy has become a skill startups must master as they scale. As they grow, startups often collect increasing volumes of data. With great power comes great responsibility. Regulatory regimes demand greater data security and integrity, and add complexity. How should companies manage data privacy, especially regulations like GDPR and CCPA? To answer that question, Redpoint Office Hours will host Todd Smithline on Wednesday, April 21 at 9AM PT. Todd is managing prinicipal of Smithline, PC, a San Francisco law firm focusing on technology transactions, product legal review, and open source advisory work. He has taught the video game law class at UC Berkeley School of Law since 2021. During this conversation with Redpoint’s head of founder experience, Travis Bryant, Todd will cover: what the regulations are (CCPA, GDPR, CPRA, et al) the implications of these regulations for product, marketing, and compliance how to protect your company and your customers’ data If you’d like to attend, please register here . We will collect questions from participants ahead of time, and cover some subset of them during the session. Attendees will also have a chance to ask questions during live Q&A.

More than a year after Covid washed over the software ecosystem and the tide ebbs, it’s revealing the impacts on fundamental metrics of public software companies. Sales efficiency is one of those key metrics. Covid altered the way salespeople and marketers engaged their target markets. Travel collapsed, virtual events blossomed, handshakes became Zoom namastes. How did sales efficiency evolve? Across public software companies, the average sales efficiency fell from 0.6 to 0.51 over the last 3 years. The majority of that fall occured before Covid in 2019. In contrast, sales efficiency improved throughout 2020. Examining the data by quartiles, the sales efficiency has remained largely unchanged. However, amongst the individual names the story differs. Zoom’s sales efficiency tripled, Twilio’s chart smiles, Shopify benefitted from a doubling. But by and large, most companies’ sales efficiencs remained relatively constant. This steadfastness in the metrics is all the more remarkable for it’s lack of turbulence. By and large, software companies transitioned to virtual sales seamlessly. Call it a testament to the resiliency of go-to-market teams and their virtual pair-partners, the buyers. The data does imply lengthening sales cycles, lower conversion rates, increased online spending or other leaks in the funnel offset declines in travel and field marketing expense. Virtual selling does have its tradeoffs, but the heartening conclusion is that irrespective of the sales vector, software companies close customers with constant cost-effectiveness.

Would you work for this person? It’s a simple question. It’s one I often ask in reference calls on founding teams. During one of those calls, when I should have been paying attention to the answer, I posed my self a similar question. What is it about a person that would make me leap to work for them? Intellect, ethics, ambition, conviviality, mastery, ethusiasm come to mind. But, those are subordinate characteristics. What’s the one thing? For me, it’s someone who makes others around them feel bigger. Someone who builds people up, guides them through positivity, provides perspective in an affirming way. In other words, a great teacher. This week, I experienced two leaders whose styles couldn’t be further apart. In the first, a person of tremendous power and influence, said hello, started a conversation, and asked me some questions. The goal of these questions was to make the asker feel better and make me feel small. I could imagine in the workplace, this distancing could motivate certain people. In the second, a CEO seized a moment when he saw that I could have felt small, shared a story with me one-on-one that resonated, and from nothing created a teaching moment. Carving out that time to make me feel understood. Both of these types of leaders can achieve sensational success in business. Work long enough in any industry and any job, and you’re bound to experience each style as an employee. Richard Hamming said something to the effect of, “the difference between an average person and a great one is style.” So from now on, my follow up question to “Would you work for this person?” is “What is this person’s management style?” What’s the one reason you would work for someone?

Open source software marries the decentralized community of the Internet with the ambition to build great things. Databases, application servers, streaming technologies, application deployment, and container management - many modern tools were born open source. But the clouds are rolling in for open source companies (pun intended). Today, open source software faces an identity crisis: what does it mean to be an open source company in the cloud? Imagine you’ve co-authored a massively successful open source project and you’re on the cusp of commercializing it. You face a critical decision. This decision will impact the business for the next 24 months and beyond. It will determine your price point, your roadmap, your hiring plan, your revenue, and consequently your fundraising prospects. The decision reversible, but not without pain and difficulty, and likely 3 to 4 quarters of work. What is that decision? Do you support on-premises deployments or launch a managed service (aaS)? This is a challenging, hand-wringing, sleepless-nights decision for many open source companies. On one hand, the previous generation of open source companies did start out supporting on-premises. With that strategy, they’ve built huge businesses. And for good reason. The open source user base already uses, deploys, and contributes to the project. This great allure of open-source software, that customer base is already using the product, is the leverage in the model. Sales teams and marketing teams’ task is self-evident. Convert the faithful to the contracted faithful. Those sales cycles are fast and the contract sizes are large, which means cash in the bank. The name-brand contracted logos become the lighthouse accounts who respond to reference calls, proselytize the gospel on stage, and bolster the social proof of both the open source and commercial efforts. It’s enterprise-first selling. On the other hand, the future is in cloud. Most customers prefer a managed service. So should the company commercializing open source software should. Managed services are homogeneous rows of boxes in a well-run factory. On-premises deployments are messy factory floors littered with half-opened boxes skewed helter-skelter and crocodiles lurking in dark places. Services offer one platform to everyone. On prem means managing 100 on-premises deployments with varying configurations, hardware, and network topologies; not to mention security postures. Second, a managed service provides defensibility with the proper open source license. If an open source project is successful, the startup commercializing it will want to defend it from the monoclouds, who will inevitably compete at some point. Third, expansion is exceedingly easy. Customers effortlessly expend more after they’ve exhausted their entitlement. But what does it mean to be open source in the cloud? Open source isn’t a differentiator in a managed service - or least much less of one. So, how will the company differentiate in the future vs potential closed source competition? And this GTM strategy means tacking the mid-market first, because not many large enterprises will trust their infrastructure to a fledgling service. Building an on-prem company means hiring field sales teams, solutions architects, field marketers. aaS companies demand a different set of acronyms: SRE (site reliability engineers) and PLG (product-led growth) marketers. The Venn diagram intersection of those skill sets is a null set. Picking one means hiring a specialized team that will have limited to no ability to cross-over. So open source companies have two paths in front of them: Start on-premises and evolve to managed service. Capture more revenue sooner but face the transition from on-prem to cloud, and that entails later. Forgo the on-premises and provide the managed service immediately. Wait a longer to generate meaningful revenue, but be cloud-ready first, and tackle the competitive differentiation sooner. There’s no universal answer. But there are factors to consider when deciding: where is the the traction today, in the mid-market or the enterprise? how competitive is the space today and in the next 3 years? what differentiators does the product offer beyond open-source? and does the buyer care? how important is it to the business to generate revenue sooner rather than later? Every open source company will face this decision of when to become a cloud company. It will define the next two years of the business and nearly every aspect of the business and especially call into question: what does it mean to be open source?

UIPath, leaders in the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) category, filed their S-1 last week , revealing an impressive business. Founded in 2005 in Bucharest, Romania, by Daniel Dines and Marius Tirca, the company now operates more than 60 offices housing nearly 3000 employees. UIPath offers software to build robots, programs that automate repetitive work. Some examples include streamlining customer onboarding. Robots read pdfs that customers provide and input that data into other computer systems. Customer support teams might use RPA robots to read the contents of an email, find an order number, look up the order, and present the support agent with some key data. The UIPath suite includes the software to write, execute, monitor, and maintain these robots. In the last three years, UIPath has grown ARR from $169m to $580m, a CAGR of 151%. Though it may seem that the growth was simply executing a constant gameplan, the underlying data suggests a significant shift in strategy. UIPath’s average annual contract value (ACV) grew from $17.9k to $72.5k in the same three year span, with a 3x jump between 2019 and 2020. In 2021, the business counted more than 8000 customers, with 1000 paying more than $100k and 89 paying more than $1m. In addition, 70% of new bookings in 2021 originated from expansions. The company also mentions the 2016 cohort of customers expanded 51x in the last 5 years. The increase in ACV, number of million dollar customers, and bookings composition implies the compnay pushed to serving bigger, enterprise customers. Why is this? My supposition is that robots improve efficiency by some percentage, let’s hazard 5-30%. Those efficiency gains don’t mean much for a company of generating $1m in ARR, but they are massive savings for companies operating call centers costing billions annually; a 5% improvement in a $2b support operation is $100m in
savings accreting immediately as profits. Concurrent with the evolution in ACV, we can observe a few other trends. First, the company trimmed a -155% net income margin to -15%, a brobdingnagian (aka massive) improvement. Second, UIPath’s cash flow margin, (defined as cash flow from operations divided by revenue), shows the company has attained a turnaround of similar magnitude on a cash basis. Larger enterprise contracts imply longer contract terms and larger pre-payments, boosting these figures. Improving the net income margin and the cash flow margin this quickly for a business of this scale is like ungrounding a large container ship from an Egyptian canal - no easy feat. Throughout this transition upmarket, the company has sustained a strong sales efficiency number with an implied payback period of about 17-18 months. Lastly, let’s touch on UIPath’s revenue streams. Unlike many other SaaS companies, UIPath counts three distinct streams: licenses (customers paying for software), support & maintenance (assistance in running and maintaining robots), and services (training). Licenses constitute the majority of the revenue, followed closely by Support, with services comprising less than 5% of revenues. The ratio of support & maintenance to license revenue has increased from 50% to 67% over this three year time period. One hypothesis for this trend is that customers initially bought a large number of licenses and are now working with UIPath and the 3100 system integrators in their network to build a larger number of robots per license seat. It’s consistent with the previous data that the business is moving upmarket and cross-selling more frequently. Impressively the gross margins for the two main revenue streams are stellar. Licenses revenue is 98% gross margin because the product runs on customers’ computers. Without infrastructure costs, the cost to produce the product is zero. Support and maintenance operates at 90% gross margin, nearly 20 percentage points above the public median of 71%. So investors should be indifferent to the revenue mix when considering gross profit. The services gross margin is -19%. But at less than 5% of overall revenues, it’s barely worth mentioning. UIPath’s metrics rank it as one of the fastest growing and capital efficient businesses today. The transition apparent in the metrics must have been a tremendous effort internally, but the dividends are plain to see in the S-1 and even more so when the company begins trading. Congratulations to the team at UIPath on building a world-class company.

Developer tools and business-to-developer companies are among some of our favorite category of startup. We’ve had the privilege to partner with many of the leaders like Stripe, Twilio, Hashicorp, LaunchDarkly, SourceGraph, and Heroku, among many others. Developer documentation is one of the differentiators in developer community building efforts. If you’re an engineer, and you hear about an interesting project, the first place you’ll land is the documentation. Guides that are easy to follow, have clear examples, and guide an engineer through a smooth experience grease the user engagement and acquisition funnel. How should B2D companies invest in their documentation? To answer that question, on Wednesday, March 31st at 9:00 AM PT, Redpoint Office Hours will host Pavi Sandhu . Pavi has more than 20 years of experience leading documentation and user education initiatives, at companies such as Salesforce, Amazon, Mesosphere, and MongoDB. Pavi co-founded Salesforce’s learning platform, Trailhead, which now has more than two million users. In the conversation, our colleague Astasia Myers will ask Pavi questions covering: Importance of documentation for a robust developer ecosystem Industry 4.0 and the latest evolution in developer documentation Building and scaling developer and user education If you’d like to attend, please register here . We will collect questions from participants during registration and try to cover them throughout the discussion. Attendees will also have the opportunity to participate in a live Q&A throughout the session.

Recently, Jim Benton joined us for Redpoint Office Hours to share insights from his vantage point as CEO of Chorus.ai on how sales has changed during the COVID era. Jim shared many data points that opened up my eyes to some of the challenges and the opportunities before modern sales professionals. I took away three key ideas, though we covered much more in the session. Natalie, Chorus’ VP of Marketing, whispered in my ear before the session that I should ask Jim about Ted Lasso, the television series. Jim asked his management team to watch it both because it’s uproarious and we all benefit from a laugh, and also because Ted Lasso practices many great management techniques. Jim started as CEO just as shelter-in-place started. Imagine running a company not having met most of the team. How do you create alignment? Coach Ted Lasso has the answers. After a fun foray into management theory, Jim shared some data points from the 15 million calls Chorus analyzed in their public report on the state of conversation intelligence. Here are a few bullets
- sellers invite senior decision- makers to sales meetings much more often in the post-COVID era than before. Inviting sales managers to those calls increases conversion rates by 34%.
- sales processes require 4.1 meetings over video, compared to 2.8 before, about 50% more time.
- storytelling has become more important in closing accounts. The top performing sales people tell 20% more stories. And 68% of the time, those stories include social proof to establish credibility. Last, Jim shared with us a vision for the future of sales: hybrid selling. Sales meetings will be hybrid: two people in the room, and two people dialing in by video, for example. Because of that pattern, sales professionals will default to presenting in Zoom to ensure they can handle the last minute comment that an attendee will be joining remotely. This is an advantage: sales team will capture data on every meeting, not just virtual ones. And the best sales managers use that
data to coach. Above all, I found myself admiring Jim’s exuberance and passion for the art of selling. “We get a front row seat to the world’s problems and we get to go solve them…We are saving careers by representing magical solutions.” I’m grateful to Jim for sharing his data, management philosophy, and selling ethos. It was an inspiration.

I’ve been following many public market investors on Twitter over the past few weeks to understand how they view the vacillation of the public markets. One of the tweets linked to a speech Stanley Druckenmiller gave in 2015 about Black Wednesday . At the time, Druckenmiller worked for George Soros at a hedge fund. “George, I’m going to sell $5.5 billion worth of British pounds tonight and buy deutsche marks. Here’s why I’m going to do it, that means we’ll have 100% of the fund in this one trade”. As I’m talking, he starts wincing like what is wrong with this kid, and I think he’s about to blow my thesis away and he says, “That is the most ridiculous use of money management I’ve ever heard. What you describe is an incredible one-way bet. We should 200% of our net worth in this trade, not 100%. Do you know how often something like this comes around? Like once every 20 years. What is wrong with you?” The trade turned out to be a massive success for both of them. The anecdote made me laugh just as much for its delivery with the twist, as for the familiarity of unexpected turns in investment decision-making. This conversation, or some form of it, is played out across the financial ecosystem every day: one person pitching another an idea. Most of the time, the thesis doesn’t land. But every once in a while, the pitch evokes a reaction like Soros’ in this story. When I started in venture capital, I didn’t realize this happened. It took me a long time to figure it out. VCs are market-makers in a sense. On the sell-side of the market, they convince entrepreneurs to work with them as board members and investors. And on the buy-side of the transaction, VCs convince their firm’s investment team to partner with a founding team. Bringing those two parties together is at the heart of successful deal-making in venture firms. Every once in a while, when hearing pitching an idea, the investment team will roar with excitement and it’s a lot of fun, especially when resonates unexpectedly. When it happens next at Redpoint, I’ll be thinking of this exchange between Druckenmiller and Soros.

A 20% delta in net dollar retention (NDR) may not seem like much, just a trifle, but make no mistake, it’s massive. In preparing for a presentation at next week’s Saastr Build conference, I reviewed this S-1 analysis for DataDog that I had published a few years ago. It shows the difference in the net dollar retention across three competitors in the same space, Application Performance Monitoring: DataDog, New Relic, and AppDynamics. At the time of IPO, DataDog charted 151% NDR compared to 123% for AppDynamics and 115% at NewRelic. That may not seem like a big difference. But it is. Let me show you why. Imagine three companies: one at 120% NDR, one at 140% NDR and the last at 160% NDR. In five years, assuming all else is equal, how much bigger is the last company than the first? The answer is 4.2x - four times bigger! And 1.9x bigger than the company with 120% NDR. Each marginal 20% of NDR is a doubling of company ARR in 5 years.

About a year ago, I wrote a post on the hub and spoke data model . The idea is that in the future SaaS applications would be built on a single database, instead of each SaaS application writing to its own proprietary database. I was wrong about the catalyst for this hub-and-spoke model. I thought it would be cloud-prem and customers driving SaaS products to use a single database. Instead, the SaaS ecosystem and the data ecosystem are moving in this direction on their own. We haven’t seen an architectural shift in SaaS since the advent of the multi-tenant database, which allowed SaaS companies to put all of their data across customers on a single database. This may be the next shift. Let’s talk about the innovation and then the implications. Here’s a schematic (click to enlarge) that describes how data flows with a cloud datawarehouse (CDW) fed SaaS app. Data arrives from various systems, is transformed, and stored in Snowflake. Then the modern SaaS applications connect to the CDW via reverse-ETL or through direct connection. The SaaS applications present insights and queue workflows and help their users achieve their goals as normal, using the data from the CDW. Underpinning this modern data stack, a data observability platform like Monte Carlo and a data security layer like Cyral ensures the data is accurate and safe. The first feedback loop influences users and customers. A company with this architecture will map out the customer journey sufficiently well to develop proxy metrics , leading indicators of customer behavior. When will this customer persona upgrade? Should we send them an in-product message? Should a sales person call them? Should we build a new product feature to satisfy their needs? Customer interactions evolve and that feeds the CDW
downstream. The second feedback loop outputs data products and insights that are then fed into the data warehouse layer for downstream consumption, perhaps in the form of dashboards in SaaS applications or machine learning models and associated metadata. SaaS applications also write back to the CDW directly. For example, a financial analyst might use data from the CDW to project different scenarios for this year’s board plan. A data scientist might develop a churn prediction algorithm. Or a security researcher might identify a vulnerability in customer systems that violate the company’s SOC2 certification. These two feedback loops accelerate, spinning the data flywheel pushing more information into the data warehouse. This in turn encourages more SaaS applications, BI systems, and machine learning systems to rely on the CDW as a backend and single integration point. The second major change is modern SaaS applications will be rearchitected. Modern SaaS applications will present materialized views from the CDW. They will write back to the CDW, creating that second feedback loop. And they will start out full of insight because they benefit from the collective marketing, support, product, engineering, and every other data set owned by the company, rather than an empty system of record. Let’s make this a bit more tangible: a modern accounting system will be a series of queries on a data warehouse fed by APIs, not a hand-reconciled general ledger assembled by a team of staff accountants. Each scenario is stored in the CDW and is then used to inform future financial models, and even goals in marketing and sales SaaS products. As sales team change their behavior, this updates the model. Spin, flywheel, spin. SaaS applications may maintain a separate database of their data containing application state, user permissions and other metadata, but increasingly, the core data that used to course through a system of record will be pushed/copied to the CDW. Data like customer contracts, contact history, event attendance, product usage. This worldview implies two important themes: The cloud data warehouse will become an increasingly central part of the SaaS stack, not just the data stack. The architecture enables SaaS companies to reimagine the largest categories of software and rebuild them to challenge the incumbents. The future won’t be as elegant as this diagram describes. Nor will this transition be immediate. But I’m convinced this new architecture will shake up the SaaS ecosystem in a big way.

If you asked 5 people in Startupland to define the role of a COO, you would receive 10 different explanations. I have three myself. What does a modern COO do? The role of a COO has evolved over the past decade or so because of broader changes within the ecosystem which has created some confusion what what precisely should a COO do. Recently, Redpoint Office Hours welcomed Allison Pickens to clarify the COO role and when startups should consider recruiting one. Whereas a decade ago, a board might have hired a professional CEO to scale the operations of a startup, today, more boards seek COOs. A few hypotheses underpin this trend. The first is founders possess greater leverage today in the boardroom than in the past and seek to remain CEO longer. Second, more companies have adopted a product-led growth (PLG motion). Product and technology-centric founders should remain at the helm of these businesses longer because the product drives the GTM. Regardless of the reasons, more startups are looking to hire a COO. If you’re in the market for a COO, how should you write the job description? Allison answered this question with a stunningly lucid phylogenetic tree of COO archetypes. The Four COO Archetypes Chief of Staff - a founder recruits a CoS to combat an increasing workload of project work. The CEO needs 10-12 hours more throughput each day and this person provides that help. The CoS doesn’t manage anyone. The CFO+ / operations lead - the CEO notices misalignment amongst the management team and may need help running team meetings, OKRs, or entire teams like the people, finance, legal, data and the systems to power them to success. Chief Journey Officer/Chief Revenue Officer - The CEO observes GTM challenges and the customer journey requires refinement. This archetype oversees all GTM including marketing, sales, and post-sales. Run the Business - The founder decides they would like someone to run the business day-to-day, to free themselves to evangelize or focus on one part of the business. Allison also shared a not-uncommon pattern of a Chief of Staff being promoted from within. They might start by succeeding with the first operational projects, hiring the team to staff it, and then managing the team as they scale. Having accomplished this a few times, Chief of Staff becomes the operations lead. If you’d like to read more about this important topic, Allison delves into much more detail here in her recap of the event. I want to thank Allison for her trenchant insights which clarified an important trend in management team composition and at the same time I had a great time talking about it.

So you’re looking to start a company. What do you call it? Once you’ve figured that out, which domain suffix do you choose? .com, .net, .biz, .monster, .duck, .theworldisyouroyster? Given the explosion in domain suffix permutations I wondered if startups’ behavior had changed over the last decade. In fact, it has changed significantly as the chart above shows. Click to enlarge the image. Dotcoms dwarf other domain choices in demand but their dominance has diminished as the days pass. Down from 89% in 2007, the .com designation adorns the addresses of 64% of startups founded in 2020. Dotcoms are more dear because they are the default domain suffix most users type when dropping by a website. (alliteration) .co isn’t far behind dotcom. And why not do without an extra letter? A keystroke saved is a keystroke you’ll have to delete after the iPhone’s autocomplete vehememently insists on adding the “missing” m when you type the address into Safari. (antithesis) Today, the .net suffix’s popularity is withering away. Down more than 75% in share over the last 20 years, the .net harkens a bygone era of the internet, when hipsters called it the ‘Net. A .net domain evokes wistful memories of Earthlink and Sourceforge. It’s not the best choice for today. (epanalepsis) .ai means a startup is all about the future. .AI connotes a company that uses machines to model, classify, synthesize, or process natural language. If you employ any of these four techniques, this suffix is for you. (merism) What does that mean about startups ending in .io, which have risen to the top 5 in the last 5 years? Based in the Indian Ocean? Or perhaps the third largest moon of Jupiter and most volcanically active planet in the solar system? More prosaically, maybe the company offers a product managing inputs and outputs. Smells like the future. (synesthesia) Zoom is likely the most well recognized startup with a .us domain. It’s a great choice for those who pride themselves on an easy domain to type and patriotism. (syllepsis) My theories about .xyz are yet unformed…(aposiopesis) .gg is for gaming companies. It probably means “good game.” As a SaaS investor, these businesses aren’t in my bailiwick, but since .gg is the official suffix of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, if you’re a live streamer based in the Channel Islands, the .gg suffix certainly is in yours. (polyptoton) The .ly suffix transformed every company into an adverb and it had it’s time in the sun. Appearing suddenly in 2010, it promptly disappeared - confoundingly abruptly and surprisingly unexpectedly - in 2015 - albeit, justly in my view. (killing Hemingway softly). Aside from highlighting some of the trends in startup domain name preferences, this post has another motivation. Each of the paragraphs above uses a different rhetorical device and it’s meant to be read as a playground of words. I read the excellent The Elements of Eloquence which enumerates more than thirty different techniques for improving writing, tools Shakespeare, Fitzgerald, and other greats employed, and I was trying a few out. The names of these techniques follow each paragraph in parentheses. If you’re curious about language, I highly recommend it. I wish I’d learned some of these in grade school. They would have punched up my term papers. PS. the one about Hemingway is my contribution. He abhorred the adverb!

On Wednesday, March 3rd at 10:00 AM PT, Redpoint Office Hours will host Jim Benton , CEO of Chorus.ai , a leader in conversational intelligence. As Co-Founder of ClearSlide and later as CEO of Apollo, Jim helped create the Sales Engagement category. From Evite to AdBrite to ClearSlide, Jim has expanded new categories and scaled revenue teams from zero to tens of millions in SaaS revenue. 2020 pushed sales teams to learn new sales motions selling online. Jim has been hosting weekly briefings with many top sales leaders exploring ways to navigate the turbulence. In addition, the Chorus team published the State of Conversation Intelligence Report which analyzed 35m sales calls to explore how the most effective teams sell today. During this office hours, we’ll explore:
- the challenges sales teams face selling today
- the management techniques and metrics modern sales teams use
- what is working when selling in COVID If you’re interested to attend, please register by Wednesday, February 24. We will collect questions from participants before the event, weave them into the conversation, and answer live questions at the end of the session. We look forward to welcoming Jim to Office Hours!

If I gave you $1000 to invest, and five investment options how would you decide? What if you were the CEO of a startup, and a VC invested $10m, and each of your five VPs had different project ideas? This is the question John Kelly, researcher at Bell Labs, sought to answer. A contemporary of Claude Shannon, Kelly intertwined Shannon’s information theory with probability to develop an idea of his own: the Kelly criterion . His theory would translate into tremendous investing prowess and lead him to one of the best long term track records of all time at Princeton-Newport, a hedge fund he managed to 15% net IRR compared to the S&P at 8%. Kelly wanted to solve for two key ideas: avoid total loss: the investment strategy should never result in a 0 or negative balance. grow the value as quickly as possible. He developed the Kelly criterion. I won’t dive into the math there, but I will highlight lessons applicable broadly. First, to calculate the expected value of an investment don’t use the average (also called the arithmetic mean); use the geometric mean. The difference is simple, but powerful. Imagine you have three investment options, each equally likely. They return 100%, 50% and 0%. The arithmetic mean/average/expected value is 50%: (100+50+0)/3. The geometric mean is 0%: cubic root of (100 50 0). The Kelly criterion says don’t invest. Quite a different result. Second, size your investment properly. Invest too much and bankruptcy looms. Bet too little, and your returns won’t amount to a pile of beans. How do you calculate how much to bet? Kelly criterion says to bet more the greater your edge and the likelihood of success. KC = W - (1-W)/R KC = kelly criterion (the percentage of your balance sheet to invest)
W = probability of winning
R = win/loss ratio Read the intricacies here. and for a longer explanation, Fortune’s Formula . In practice, many people using Kelly systems bet half or three quarters of the criterion because we tend to overestimate our odds of success. Also, overbetting leads to bankruptcy. Better to be conservative. There’s a wealth of research on Kelly strategies and many prominent investors use these techniques. Startup CEOs are capital-allocators-in-chief . Their responsibility to decide which bets to make and how large they ought to be. The Kelly criterion provides both a conceptual and mathematical framework for evaluating those alternatives.

At Redpoint, we believe 2020 is the decade of data . We’ve partnered in the leaders of the next generation of data from the earliest stages; companies like Snowflake, Looker, and Dremio. Leaders rely more on data every day to inform our decisions, to power our products, and to communicate. In short, the data pipelines that move data from one place to another have become the nervous system of the modern organization. But an essential piece of kit has been missing in this new world that answers the question: How do you know the data you’re using is right? Everyone who has prepared data for decision-makers remembers that moment and the subsequent sinking feeling when a leader examined a report and said, “wait, that doesn’t look right.” Monte Carlo solves these problems with their Data Observability platform. Monte Carlo monitors data pipelines to alert you when the data isn’t fresh, when the distribution of the data has changed, or when something isn’t quite right. With Monte Carlo, you can trust your data every time. That’s a quote we’ve heard from our diligence time-and-time again, and one of the reasons we’ve invested in Monte Carlo and partnered with Barr & Lior, the founders of Monte Carlo. Their mission is to eliminate data downtime, and it’s a mission we deeply believe in. Within 5 years, every modern data team will deploy data observability because leaders won’t trust data that has been sourced otherwise. We’re thrilled to partner with the Monte Carlo team as they create the data observability category and eliminate Data Downtime!

On Wednesday, February 17th at 9:30 AM PT, Redpoint Office Hours will host Allison Pickens , the former COO of Gainsight and one of Fortune’s Most Powerful Women. Throughout her time there, she scaled the SaaS company from $1M ARR to pre- IPO, along the way, creating the category of customer success software, and paving the way for Gainsight’s $1.1B sale. Today, she advises and invests in companies on these topics and others. Allison is an incredible builder of teams. She’s written extensively on the topic and co-authored a book The Customer Success Economy . In addition to talking about the evolution of customer success, Allison and I will talk about the COO role. COOs have become more common in management teams as ways for founders & CEOs to build the management team to scale a business. In conversations with management teams, the concept of a COO remains murky. In this conversation, we’ll clarify the COO, talking about topics like: What does a great COO do? How does the role work with the CEO? Should you hire a COO for your startup? If so, at what stage? How you should you go about recruiting the right person? If you’re interested to attend, please register by Wednesday, Feb 10. Please submit questions ahead of time. I’ll weave them into the conversation. As always, we reserve 15 minutes at the end for the audience to ask questions live. Looking forward to the conversation with Allison, and answering your questions on the topics of COOs, Customer Success, and category creation.

It’s February 1st and many software startups herald the new fiscal year with Sales Kick Off (SKO). During SKO, leaders discuss the strategy of the company, discuss product advances, and share the financial plan highlights including changes to quota and accelerators for sales commissions. During the past few weeks, finance and management teams will have been busy developing the financial plan for this year. The key number is the new bookings which implies the growth rate for next year. For sales driven companies, the new bookings number falls out of the number of account executives staffed on the team multiplied by their quota multiplied by the expected quota attainment (typically 60-75%). More sophisticated financial plans include other components to drive better prediction accuracy: discounting quota capacity by discounting quota for ramping (new) account executives consideration for both account executive and sales manager turnover of around 20-25% annually funnel analysis tying sales performance to lead generation and marketing budget for program spend and headcount Expected quota attainment is consistently overlooked and over-projected. In many of these plans, teams project using the average quota attainment for last year. This assumption can be problematic, and instead the projections should use the median. Let me show you why. Imagine a sales team with five people with the following attainment for last year and for simplicity, I’m assuming all of them are fully ramped. Account Executive Quota Attainment Hiawatha 130% Siana 100% Lionel 80% Olivia 60% Anton 25% The average quota attainment is 79%. Remember that number. Now let’s change the individual attainment around, while keeping the company’s bookings performance last year the same. Account Executive Quota Attainment Hiawatha 180% Siana 125% Lionel 50% Olivia 25% Anton 15% Do you remember the average last time? It’s the same average this time: 79%. But you should trust the first team’s ability to attain 80% of quota next year much than the second team. Why? In scenario 2, two AEs of five contribute 85% of the performance. The average doesn’t capture this concentration and the risk associated with assuming continued performance. Imagine the impact to attainment if a competitor were to poach Siana in Q1. This is why median is a better metric in this case. The median attainment for scenario 1 is 80%, identical to the average. The median for the second scenario is 50%. How does this hurt companies? Let’s assume this hypothetical company planned using 80% (average) but achieved only 50% (median). The company would hire about 40% fewer account executives than they would need to achieve their plan. And as anyone who operates a SaaS company knows, these businesses compound. A much better year next year compounds over and over. If AE quota attainment follows a uniform distribution, then using the average is fine because it’s the same as the median. But I can tell you with a decades’ worth of experience, more AE quota attainment charts resemble the second scenario than the first, especially in the early days.

There’s a trend in pitch decks and startup pitches I’ve been watching - the commingling of metrics definitions, especially ARR. Everyone reports ARR today, even in transactional businesses and market place businesses, and for good reason. The valuation multiples on annual recurring revenue are the highest across startup categories. Ten years ago Startupland began to talk about valuing early and mid-stage startups on multiples. Today, it’s de rigeur and that’s not changing anytime soon. Management teams and VCs talk multiples in partner meeting presentations, term sheet negotiations, and board room conversations. Multiples are a useful yardstick to answer the question: how do these terms compare to others’ multiples, and so it is a fair deal or a great deal? Unlike the public markets, which typically use enterprise-value-to-forward-revenue multiples, the venture industry standardized on market-cap-to-forward-ARR. One of the key terms is ARR, which is annual recurring revenue. I was taught that ARR is the value of the currently paying, deployed, and contracted customers, annualized. In other words, the ARR is a guaranteed annuity. The guarantee implies predictability, which investors prize and value at high multiples. Over time, the definition of ARR has slackened. First, SaaS companies modified it to include customers who weren’t contractually obligated to pay, but did pay the same amount regularly. Next, infrastructure companies, which charge by use (by CPU hour used, API called, or GB stored), and amassed customer bases’ with spending habits that vary by the month, adopted ARR. They argue that though customers’ usage wasn’t predictable on a small scale, over a large enough customer base, customer behavior is similarly predictable to contracted spend. Then, consumer subscription businesses began pitching using ARR. After all, there’s not much difference between an SMB paying monthly and a consumer paying monthly. However, there is a meaningful difference in net-dollar retention because most consumer companies have negative NDR, and most SaaS companies benefit from positive NDR (accounts that expand over time). But let’s set that aside. And then, marketplaces shifted from GMV to annualizing net transactional revenue and calling it ARR. Tom-ay-to / tom-ah-to. To come full circle, there’s a newer ARR metric for SaaS companies called cARR, which is contracted ARR, or the annualized value of the contracts signed but not deployed. That number is typically larger and provides a bigger number to multiply, hence a higher valuation. Should all these companies benefit from the same ARR multiples? Probably not. And investors certainly do apply somewhat different multiples to different revenue quality. But this trend of calling all flavors of revenue “ARR” isn’t changing any time soon. The multiple benefit is just too appealing to pass up.

How important is uptime to your business? As more business moves online, an increasing number of companies have to answer than critical question. When products and services fail, customers can’t buy online or use their software, they churn, and the company suffers brand damage. Too much downtime can trigger clauses in software contracts for service level agreements (SLAs), which start cancellation conversations. Many businesses are moving their infrastructure and software to the cloud to adopt Kubernetes and microservices. Those technologies offer terrific benefits in exchange for some complexity. Chaos engineering or resiliency engineering is the dominant way to mitigate the intricacies of modern cloud stacks. By stressing a system ahead of time to find its weaknesses, engineers can buttress the weak points of a system, ensuring the software runs smoothly more often. Just how effective is chaos engineering? The chart above, from the 2021 edition of the State of Chaos Engineering , shows the impact visually. Teams that perform chaos have more uptime. 82% of those surveyed who run chaos regularly have 99% uptime or better. 87% of those who run chaos twice per month, and 92% who run daily have 99% uptime or better. The more active the chaos program, the better the for a business. There’s a critical corollary benefit. Teams running chaos fix problems faster. The median-time-to-resolution (MTTR, aka time to fix an issue) for companies running chaos improves dramatically. Half of those running chaos boast an MTTR of less than a day, compared to less than 30% of those not using chaos. Amazon and Netflix pioneered the use of chaos to improve uptime and decrease MTTR. Today, many more leaders adopt chaos to ensure smooth delivery of their software to the customers. Expedia, JP Morgan, Mailchimp, Qualtrics, Target, Twilio, Under Armour, Walmart are just some of those adopting chaos. Chaos is the next step after adopting Kubernetes and microservices. These modern technologies are powerful but complex, and chaos is the toolkit modern teams use to ensure the infrastructure sustains the pounding traffic of customers and users.

How do you measure how much information a statement contains? The short answer is surprise. If you live in Los Angeles and I told you the weather tomorrow would be sunny, you would receive no information from me. It’s sunny there every day. But if I told you Salesforce intends to buy Uber to ferry salespeople to their prospects, that would be interesting! Claude Shannon invented this idea, information as surprise . His theories enabled modern-day computing, with many others contributing. And if you’re curious about that chronology, read the sublime book The Dream Machine , but let’s stick with information as surprise for this post. Clickbait, those attention grabbing headlines all over the internet, thrive because they shock us, grab our attention. Those eye-catching articles are the grocery aisle tabloids of our generation. TED talks benefit from the same concept: short talks with leaders in a domain who astonish us with insight about our world and ourselves: how we carry ourselves changes our confidence , how education impinges creativity , or how an outbreak would impact the world according to Bill Gates in 2014 . We see this in software, too. Intrusion prevention systems alert engineers to potential breaches. If that system spews out false alarms all day, the system provides no insight. But if it reports few accurate anomalies, it’s invaluable. Equally so for a Looker dashboard that shows revenue spiked last week in California. The next time you find yourself astonished, amazed, stupefied, or dumbfounded, recall Shannon’s theory of information content. Use it to your advantage whenever you present, write, or discuss. The hook, that idea that captures an audience, the challenger sale which provokes a sales prospect to think differently about a product, the unexpected connection in an outbound email - all of these evoke surprise. This idea is so powerful that it spawned modern computing. At the same time, it can teach us how to liven up our small talk.

On Thursday, February 4th at 9:30 AM PT, Redpoint Office Hours will host Daria Kissner , who built and led internal and external communications for Google Ads and Commerce, and YouTube. With the transition to remote work, the discipline of internal communications has become critical for startups to master. Keeping teams motivated, aligned, and connected when each person is in a different place is a new muscle for many startups to train. Our own Hollie Wegman , currently an EIR at Redpoint and formerly CMO at Segment, who joined Office Hours as a guest, will change seats and host Daria to guide founders through three topics: the role of internal communications, how it differs from public relations and marketing, and where it resides in an organization why internal communications are so important especially as a company scales when to hire and scale internal communications people and efforts, and how to get started If you’re interested in attending, please register here by Thursday, January 28th. This will be an interactive event, and we will collect questions from participants ahead of time. Attendees will also have time to ask Daria questions live. We look forward to another great Office Hours with Daria!

On January 27-28, Dremio host their second Subsurface conference . Cloud Data Lakes are the future of large scale data analysis , and the more than 5000 registrants to the first conference substantiate this massive wave. This time, the conference will build on the foundation from last year’s event. Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, Global Vice President for AWS Storage will deliver one of the keynotes. Also, Tableau’s Chief Product Officer François Ajenstat will discuss the Tableau’s role in the cloud data lake. Plus, leaders from Microsoft PowerBI, Apache Iceberg, Amundsen, Monte Carlo and many others will share their views on the advances they’re seeing in cloud data lakes and the software that’s being built around them. In my predictions post for 2021, I said that the 2020s will be the decade of data. Cloud data lakes are a key technology enabling the innovation in analytics and machine learning. On top of these lakes,  data movement companies move data to the right consumers. Data engines query the data rapidly, inexpensively. Data modelling companies create single definitions of metrics for consistency across organizations. Data quality companies monitor pipelines and alert when anomalies appear. Data security companies keep data in the right hands. This ecosystem is burgeoning and advancing rapidly. If you’re curious to learn more about cloud data lakes and engines, come to Subsurface .

From time to time, I chart the fastest growing categories of startup investment in the US for seed through Series C. Here are 2015 , 2017 ,  This year, I was certain the categories would have been influenced by COVID19. I analyzed Crunchbase data and looked for the startup categories that grew fastest in terms of funding rounds year-over-year, provided there were at least 10 rounds in that category. Quantum computing topped the list with a doubling of rounds. The leader doesn’t have much to do with COVID ostensibly but is likely propelled by increasing interest in the technology because of recent advances in quantum computing design and manufacture. Dating is next, followed by battery companies, doubtlessly benefiting from the surge of electric vehicle sales and boom in consumer electronics. Video conferencing is no surprise: it’s the new office for many information workers. Music streaming, test and measurement, and quality assurance initially baffled me. But let me explain: music streaming includes companies empowering musicians to hold live digital events supplanting the coliseum experience with high definition video and audio at home. Testing & measurement is a broad category that includes home diagnostics companies for medical testing, electronic sensors for measuring hardware and equipment, and even application performance monitoring. By virtue of the importance of data when working remotely and the breadth of applications of that data, this category popped into the top 10. Quality Assurance is truly about the automation of certain parts of software testing. The automation of QA is a secular trend that perhaps accelerated with more software engineers working from home. Life insurance and emergency medicine certainly fit the COVID-19 narrative. Developer APIs includes a litany of different developer tools and services. And with many developers working remotely full time, perhaps they express greater interest in other services as a result of being sheltered-in-place, but that seems spurious to me. Rather, this category is buttressed by an ever increasing number of software engineers searching for the best way to accomplish a goal with a new tool, API, or service. Maybe 6 of the 10 fastest growing startup categories are influenced by the pandemic with the others (Quantum Computing, Battery, Quality Assurance, and Developer APIs) fueled by other waves. The question for 2021 will be: how will vaccinations and a return to normalcy change consumer and enterprise buying behaviors, and consequently, startup financing rates in different categories? If you have a hypothesis, send me a tweet at @ttunguz .

The Art of Doing Science and Engineering is a curious book. Richard Hamming, the author, was a professor of science and engineering at the Naval Postgraduate School and researcher at Bell Labs. He knew quite a bit about science and engineering. The book is curious because it’s written in the first person and defies categorization. Part memoir, other times, a mathematics lecture on information theory, and yet others a book on life philosophy. Within the first 30 pages, Hamming delves into back of the envelope calculations. I was expecting questions a candidate might be asked in a consulting interview. How many ping pong balls fit into a 747? How many violinist repair shops are there in Chicago? Hamming skips the linear. His idea of back of the envelope is a geometric equation, modeling explosive behavior that exists in many parts of nature and business. Staring at an equation with an integral’s large S and a dydx component, brought me back to calculus, and for the life of me, I couldn’t recall how to integrate infinite series. But, I should, shouldn’t I? That’s the question I was asking myself. Startups are nothing if not chasers of exponential growth. When looking at startup data, shouldn’t I model data to test it for geometric growth? Shouldn’t anyone who deals with compounding? From back of the envelope calculations, Hamming waxes philosophical about humans and machines. Often, machines achieve the same goal, but in a radically different way than nature. Planes and birds both fly, but differently. When inventing new machines and programs, aim to achieve the same goal, but by other means. There are gems like this: “most everyone who opens up a new field does not really understand it the way the followers do.” The inventor of the field has wandered through a forest to discover and carries the burden of that history clouding judgment. Others approach the field with a beginner’s mind. Interspersed, you’ll find tidbits of history from early computing like: “At the time sap first appeared I would guess about 1% of the older programmers were interested in it—using sap was “sissy stuff,” and a real programmer would not stoop to wasting machine capacity to do the assembly.” Sap was a language built on top of assembly, which is machine language. Even in the 1950s, engineers debated which language showed your clout and embracing/revolting against new layers of abstraction. He concludes with a debate on intelligent machines and machine learning. Hamming asks, what is thinking? If I integrate a derivative and a computer integrates the same derivative, is that the same? If a human combines two ideas to create a novel third idea, that’s thinking. What about when a computer generates a new song by sampling two other songs? It’s a wild ride and a lot of fun if you like science and engineering, and thinking about how it fits into the world.

Imagine two public SaaS companies, identical in every respect but one. The first grows revenue twice as fast as the second. How much more valuable should the first be? Twice as valuable isn’t the answer. Most investors value stocks using multiples, which tend to obscure the underlying drivers of value. Many
investors also seek to distinguish between value and growth stocks, which are commonly sorted based on
multiples of earnings or book value. The important drivers of value are opaque with these practices, and very
few investors have a clear sense of how revisions in expectations for those drivers change multiples. Michael Mauboussin is a leading markets thinker. He wrote a short paper recently called The Math of Value and Growth that’s worth sharing to answer the question in the first paragraph. He included this chart which shows the P/E multiple on the y-axis and NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax), a measure of profitability on the x-axis. The key point is that a company growing faster should enjoy a multiple that grows geometrically with the growth rate, not linearly. Let’s plot the current multiples of software companies to see if the shape appears in the current market. The vertical axis differs because most software companies are typically valued on forward multiple, not Price/Earnings (P/E). The answer is yes. There is a geometric curve to forward multiples, so the market does recognize the compounding power of growth rate, as Mauboussin’s model says it should. It’s not a perfect curve as there’s a dip in the 50-60% growth rate. That dip may be because I haven’t isolated other variables like profitability, market size, gross margin, and many others. What we haven’t solved, and will never solve though, is the right scale of the y-axis. Is the span of 3 to 80 NTM forward multiples the “right” one that accurately values companies today based on market conditions? I’m afraid no model can answer that fully. But the point we can make today is that multiples should follow a power-law, a geometric shape as a function of growth rate, and they do in the public software markets. And that’s why growth is so desirable: it increases the value of the company exponentially.

When I say bubble, you likely conjure images of people speculating on real estate or stocks or tulips in your imagination. Like me, you might dismiss the folly of these bubbles as the collective action of a multitude of people who lose all rationality when bidding on these assets. But, as I learned from a recent interview with Brian Christian , bubbles can be created even when everyone acts rationally. This phenomenon is called an information cascade. Here’s how it works. Suppose we have two opaque mason jars. One jar contains 2/3 red balls, 1/3 gray balls (majority-red). The other contains 2/3 gray balls and 1/3 red balls (majority-gray). I pick one of the two jars and place it before the a line of four people. The first person steps up to draw a ball, and I instruct them,“Look at the color of the ball, but reveal the color to no one, and replace the ball. Given the color of the ball in your hand, share a guess of which jar is in front of you. Either majority-red or majority-gray.” Suppose the first person pulls out a red ball. The first person should declare “majority-red,” since the odds are better that a red ball originate from the majority-red jar (66% vs 33%) Suppose the second person also pulls out a red ball. She should also say “majority-red.” Irrespective of the ball color the third person pulls, the third person will always say “majority-red.” If it’s a red ball, three red balls imply the majority-red jar. If it’s a gray ball, then it’s 2 reds and 1 gray, also imply a majority-red jar. Every subsequent student is going to say majority-red, even if they are holding gray, because everyone before them will have said majority-red. This is the permanent and inevitable information cascade that can result when the first two balls are of the same color and everyone acts rationally. Read more about this theory and the math supporting it here . Information cascades like these occur because we infer beliefs from others’ actions. If three acquirers are bidding $250M to acquire a seed stage company, a fourth acquirer may infer from other bidders’ actions that the business is worth a quarter of a billion dollars, even if the fourth acquirer’s financial model doesn’t support it. A bidding war ensues. These auction pressure dynamics lead to ever higher prices for assets. If the house down the corner sold for $1M, and my house is newer and on a bigger lot, then it should be worth more than $1M. Startup X raised at $50M pre-money valuation with a revenue of $500k. Mine is worth the more because it generates $750k in revenue. This continues ever higher until someone says “the jar is majority-blue.” That person,  when attempting to dispel the fallacy of the bubble, acts irrationally. All the information in the market should lead her to another conclusion. But she begins to deflate the bubble by deciding the value of an asset based on her own information, her own models, her own assessment. Information cascades don’t only happen in the financial markets. They also happen in meetings. Peter Drucker wrote the story of Alfred Sloan, the former CEO of GM, who entered a board meeting to discuss an important issue before the company. Sloan asked the opinions of his directors. When everyone agreed without comment, he immediately stopped the board meeting and said something along the lines of, “Since we’re all in agreement, it’s clear no one has considered the issue. Let us reconvene tomorrow after giving the matter appropriate thought.” The obligation to dissent is the only way to combat information cascades.

Today, RedHat announced that it has acquired StackRox . By joining forces with RedHat, StackRox, which provides Kubernetes-native security, completes the next step a journey that started six ago, and will become a key part of OpenShift. The world of container and Kubernetes security evolved enormously during the past six years. Docker burst onto the scene and its containers took the infrastructure world by storm. Then, there was a scrap for the best orchestration and Kubernetes won out. These two foundational technology shifts ushered in the DevSecOps movement. Today, StackRox enables DevSecOps for many leading companies including Splunk, Zendesk, SumoLogic, UIPath, Supercell, Priceline, Looker and many others. Through it all, Kamal, Ali, and the rest of the StackRox team led the business to become the first Kubernetes native security company and a leader in the category. I’m very grateful to the entire team and especially the leadership at StackRox for inviting me on the journey. Congratulations to the entire team on achieving a terrific milestone and becoming the security layer for a foundational Kubernetes distribution!

Erica Brescia, the COO of Github, a company in which 70% of the workforce has worked remotely for a decade, wrote in the Economist about how remote working is different and better. There have been many perspectives shared on remote work, but Erica’s perspective adds an intriguing detail. Managers tasked with creating a culture of collaboration within a distributed team will find the profile of a leader changes. A recent study found that the skills and traits of successful leaders in an in-person, office-based environment differ from those needed to lead distributed, remote teams. Instead of valuing confidence and charisma, remote teams value leaders who are organised, productive and facilitate connections between colleagues. This perspective raises the question, should leaders recruit managers with different skill sets depending on the team operates in the office or remotely? I dug up the paper which you can read here and summarized the findings in a bit more detail below. Many of our colleagues rise to lead through influence rather than authority, which is called emergent leadership. Typically, there are two ways to do this: by achieving goals or demonstrating leadership traits. These are called achievement and ascriptive leadership. Ascriptive leadership occurs when a person demonstrates traits that we all typically imagine when conjuring a vision of leadership: being an intelligent, dynamic, and motivated person. The paper calls this ascriptive leadership because others ascribe leadership traits to a person by observing them. Achievement leadership means someone rises to become a leader in others’ eyes by their accomplishments and their ability to lead the team to attain goals. In the real world, in the office, in person, a leader has an opportunity to show ascriptive leadership in many different situations, and team members pick up on these. Ascription is more easily noted than achievement. In the virtual world, studies have shown leaders distinguish themselves “in logistical coordination rather than through expertise…” Monitoring team progress and coordinating team members also buttressed a leader’s standing. Achievement outshines ascription. As your startup looks to manage the ongoing challenge of remote work, consider the two types of leadership that exist and whether the role is more or less remote. This should change the nature of the questions and potentially the profile of the leaders to recruit.

Startups are business machines engineered to grow quickly. Once a company hits hypergrowth, the market exerts enormous strain on every aspect of the company. Internal processes and systems break all the time as the company moults into a new skin. It’s one thing to talk about this idea in the abstract. More tangibly, every lead hired today, whether marketing , sales, engineering  or product, will have a very different job nine months from now, much less two years from now. Imagine you work at a startup that is growing headcount 125% year over year. It’s 25 people going to 56 going to 126. You hire a head of engineering. The engineering team is 17 people. The org chart will look like this: one engineering lead with 17 engineers reporting to them. 17 direct reports is unsustainable. It’s at least one full working day of 1/1s. Plus, the engineering lead must double the size of the engineering team in the next year. And ship code on time. Priority one for the engineering lead: hire two engineering managers to reduce the span of control . More than the recruiting challenge, the engineering leader must cross the first step of the people management chasm. Instead of managing individual contributors, managing managers.  Now the team is up to 19 people and the org chart looks like this. In 9 months time, 13 more people will have joined. So you’re back to a span of control of 15. Two managers with 15 reports each. Unsustainable. So you split the management work again to end up with something like this. That’s a lot of change in nine months. Imagine the complexity in 18 months or 36 months. Did you consider this when you wrote the initial spec for the engineering lead? Instead of managing 17 individual contributors, this leader will be managing six managers across two different levels and 30 individual contributors? And having to recruit nearly 24 people in 9 months. This is a simple example but it proves the point of how much a startup can change very quickly. The leaders you hire will likely come from one of two profiles. Either they have done something similar before. Or they are a hungy up-and-comer and you’re making a bet they can do the job well. In either case, you need to hire for slope, not y-intercept . This is Stanford Professor John Ousterhost’s idea. Your startup is going to grow and change in so many different ways that it requires leaders who can learn and grow faster than the business needs them to. They need to have a steep slope, a fast learning curve. If they have a good y-intercept, but not great slope, the demands of the business will outstrip their ability to perform well. These leaders must anticipate org chart changes, hiring needs, and many other kinds of demands on the business well ahead of the current needs, so they can prepare the company to handle as many as possible, as well as possible.

Every year, I make a list of predictions and score last year’s predictions . 2020 is a year that defines the long tail events, twelve months in which black swan after black swan event seemed to hit the press. Each morning I held my breath as I checked the news wondering what headline could top yesterday’s bombshell. Here are my predictions for 2021 Working remotely for a year changes how we work forever . Meeting in person remains important for advancing careers, critical meetings, and team cohesion, but the days of the 9-5 daily commute from Monday through Friday are gone for most knowledge workers. Two days per week in the office? Three days per week in the office? Working remotely for a quarter instead of taking 20 days vacation? I’m not sure where it will settle, but working patterns won’t return to pre-2020 behaviors. 2020 becomes the decade of data . The 2010s were the decade of software and SaaS, the era when Salesforce become the first SaaS company to sail past the $100B market cap mark. The 2020s will be the era of data companies boosting massive markets. Database startups, data movement startups, data quality startups, data lineage startups, machine learning startups will be the zeitgeist of the decade as they shape the next wave of massive innovation. M&As and IPOs continue at torrid rates . The stated long term, low interest rate policy of the Fed maxes out DCF models, whipping a frenzy around high growth companies. The merry retail investors using Robinhood bolster the passive investment wave, and their market-shaping forces sustain stratospheric multiples in the public markets. Acquirers, emboldened by higher stock prices, brace themselves and outbid each other with premium multiples for high-growth startups. Blockchain technologies become mainstream driven by the adoption of national reserve banks . The US Dollar continues its decline as the global currency of trade . In response, other national reserve banks introduce Blockchain based currency creation and control systems. Product-led growth becomes the standard GTM for software and infrastructure companies . The path to the enterprise starts in the mid-market which builds a strong foundation for serving the largest customers in the world. More companies adopt the idea of qualifying buyers through a product embracing the benefits of product-led growth including faster sales cycles, greater ARR per employee, and quicker account expansion making PLG the dominant GTM strategy. Scoring last year’s predictions: The direct listing becomes the standard path to IPO. Wrong. Most high-profile IPOs have followed the standard procedure, rather than direct listings. The IPO market hasn’t been this hot since at least 2012, but likely since the dot-com era. And IPOs represented the largest share of venture-backed exits in dollar terms in the last decade. The M&A market continues to surge. Sort-of. 2020 venture-backed M&A volumes are basically the same as 2019, but I think the spirit of my prediction suggested 2020 would eclipse 2020, which it hasn’t. Distributed work becomes the norm. Correct, but not for the reasons I anticipated. I thought the remote trend would be a powerful recruiting advantage; I didn’t foresee a global pandemic obligating companies to work remotely. Public software multiples remain at elevated levels . Dead on. Current forward multiples have set records. Companies with greater than 30% annual growth trade at 25x forward revenue, a figure that would have been met with unadulterated incredulity five years ago. The fundraising environment remains strong . Correct. 2020 could be the best year ever for startups. 2021 could be even better, particularly since fundraising momentum is now a global phenomenon. European and Asian startups enjoy fundraising markets with seemingly insatiable demand for growth, paralleling the US market. So, 3.5 of 5 in 2020, which is pretty good! I hope everyone has a great end of the year. If you have other predictions, please send me a tweet . I’d love to hear them.

You have a good pipeline of prospective customers. You pitch them but things aren’t working out. You can see it in your low close rates. They are below 15-20% conversion from sales accepted lead to closed customer. You need to answer an important question: are you losing these opportunities because of sales execution or product insufficiency? Those are the two possibilities. Either the company’s sales techniques are failing to persuade customers to buy the product. Or the company hasn’t built the right product to suit the market’s needs. Why is the conversion ratio the right litmus test? A lead becomes accepted by sales when a member of the sales team (inside or field) declares it to be a qualified lead worthy of pursuit. In other words, it has been qualified to be in the ideal customer profile and so should have a reasonable chance of closing.  In each of these cases, you should measure the reason the opportunity became “closed/lost.” You can identify product insufficiency simply. You don’t have product/market fit. For companies in existing markets: customers ask for critical features that your competition offers, but your product doesn’t offer. For startups in new markets: the product doesn’t meet an important need, or doesn’t do it well. Sales execution appears in the numbers. One or two AE(s) consistently attains or exceeds quota. The remainder don’t. The underlying cause can be manifold: ineffective sales leadership, poor lead qualification precision, lack of marketing support for sales, underdeveloped or improperly hired account executives, and so on. Perhaps we can bastardize a bit of Tolstoy to summarize. “All high performing sales motions are alike; every underperforming sales motion is ineffective in its own way.” Asking this question is the first step to understanding the most critical friction in your business’ growth. Do you have a product issue or a sales issue in your sales motion?

Mark Roberge, the former Chief Revenue Officer at Hubspot, has spent 20 years in startups. As he told me a while ago, he has observed the lack of sales management and sales execution skills as one of the most consistent deficiencies limiting the potential of early stage SaaS companies. Sales execution deficiency manifests itself at roughly the same time as product market fit. There might be 20-30 people at the startup which is generating about $1-2M in ARR with 2-5 salespeople. Most of the time, this startup is the first sales experience for both the founders and the sales people. To succeed from this point, the company must cross the sales leadership chasm: recruit an ever-larger sales team, manage and coach them, and mechanize their sales team to grow quickly from $1-2M in ARR to $50M. The first step is hiring a sales leader. As Mark told me, “Most founders fail to understand that 95% of sales leaders will implement exactly the total market strategy they employed at the last company.” They will hire the same people from their network, structure the compensation plan identically, and apply the same sales processes and strategies. Frequently, the first sales leadership hire is the hardest, because it’s difficult to ascertain the right characteristics of the ideal candidate. Mark shared his three top questions he advises founders to ask head of sales candidates during the recruitment process. They are: Knowing what you do about our business, what kind of sales methodology would you run? And how does that compare to your previous role? What are the differences between your previous company and this one? What kind of salespeople would you hire, and how do they differ from the people you have hired in the past? How would you structure the compensation plan to meet the needs of our business? When interviewing head of sales candidates, founders should have decided the kind of sales model they would like to exploit, whether inside sales, field sales, freemium, or channel - or some combination.  During the interview process, they should explain to candidates the nuances of their sales processes to better understand how candidates would adapt the processes they know to the uniquenesses of this particular business. In these interviews, founders and board members should determine whether or not a candidate can combine what they have learned to previous roles, and the new information about this particular company, to forge an alloyed go to market strategy that serves this business well. The right candidate needs to be an alchemist, someone who is willing to experiment and tinker with the model, not just copy a previous model by rote.

I remember growing up reading that a Coca-Cola cost five cents, and seeing the old New Yorker magazine covers with a price tag of 15 cents, and awing over the price of a Ford Model T of $850. Today, those prices are $1.99, $8.99 and $28,940 (for a Ford F150). I learned price increases like these are called inflation and took it for granted. As I’ve lived through a few crises, I’ve tried to learn more about economic history and economic systems to answer questions like the one I should have asked: why is there inflation? Why should things cost more today than 10 years ago? Lyn Alden distills history, policy, and data to answer these kinds of questions. Her latest post, “The Fraying of the US Global Reserve System, ” summarises the three most recent US economic periods: the Gold Standard, Bretton Woods, and the Petrodollar System; and why today we’re entering a new monetary system that has broad impacts to the US dollar and the US economy. It’s an economic history lesson in 15,000 words, which admittedly is a third the length of a typical business book. But it’s well worth reading because it’s an economics history course condensed into a blog post. The key idea is this. The US used to mint money that citizens could convert to gold, called the gold standard. Over time, the banking system and the government decided to water down the dollar, so each dollar converted to less gold. The US couldn’t keep growing its gold reserve to keep up with the creation of dollars, and debts became too expensive to pay. In the 1970s, the US unlinked the dollar from gold to enable the Federal Reserve Bank to create more money as needed. Instead of being backed by gold, the US GDP backed the dollar. In other words,  citizens believe dollars are worth something but they arent convertible into anything else. During the last 30-40 years, the US dollar became the currency of global trade. Many other countries sought to trade and invest in dollars. So the US printed more dollars to accommodate these trading partners. At this point, the quantity of dollars no longer mapped to US GDP, because the Federal Reserve printed dollars at a faster rate than the US GDP was growing. Also, throughout this period and today, the government continues to create more money for other reasons. Most recently, the Federal Reserve increased the total number of US Dollars by about 20% to buttress the US economy through COVID. At each step in this journey, we’ve devalued the dollar a little bit more so it is worth a bit less. Compounded over 80 years, this behavior creates the inflationary effect in the prices I mentioned above. A magazine costs 60x more today than 70 years ago, because the value of a dollar has decreased by more than 98%. What does this mean for the US? What does it mean for prices? What does it mean for investing? These are some of the most important macroeconomic questions to ask today. And if you’re curious to understand more of the forces at play in greater depth, start with Lyn Alden’s article. It’s a terrific foundation.

Recently, we welcomed Linda Tong, GM of AppDynamics to Redpoint Office Hours. This is a summary of what we learned from that conversation. Linda’s professional journey has taken her across businesses of all sizes — from startups in hypergrowth mode to mature, multi-hundred million-dollar businesses. She started off in product marketing at Google, helping launch Google Chrome and Android. It was there that she felt inspired about the impact she could have on a startup, and from there she became a founding member at Tapjoy, and then, Nextbit. As an avid sports fanatic, she was lured to the NFL by Tom Brady (a story for another day!), and then held multiple roles at AppDynamics, where she was recently promoted to General Manager. Naturally, these disparate companies and approaches have also given her opportunities to work with lots of different people in a range of different organizational structures and teams. Through it all, she came to a realization that can be uncommon for many folks in the Bay Area: She actually prefers the challenge — and impact — she can have at a bigger company. In our recent conversation, Linda reminded us about the importance of management, the pros and cons of different cultures, and how one can manage and thrive in each. Below are the top 10 things that we learned from someone who has seen it all. 1. Managing teams allows you to do something bigger than yourself. You’re not just at a company to build products or move the business forward; instead, you’re there to do something bigger than yourself. When you get to a certain level of growth, you’re part of a business that has a product, but you’re no longer just building that product, you’re building teams. You have an opportunity to have a massive impact, not just on the business, but all the individuals within your organization. You can make an impact on their lives, the community around you, and the business that you’re a part of. 2. Unblocking, supporting, and empathizing are three key actions you should take to be a successful manager. Management is less about being really good at something and just passing down those skills. It is easy to be a micromanager, but instead what really helps is service-level leadership where the people under you don’t need you to tell them how to do their job. Instead, they need you to empower them, by unblocking their work, supporting them, and building an ecosystem around them so they can grow. 3. To empower a team, you have to trust them. Part of trusting the team is not getting in their business and asking them for an update every few seconds. You have to work with them, set expectations around what success looks like, and then step back when it comes to the approach. If you start to talk about the how, then you completely undermine any of the empowerment that you’re trying to do. 4. Create a learning culture. You won’t regret it. Linda’s favorite question to ask people when they bring her a solution is to ask them for another solution. When you start to ask questions like that, you challenge people to think outside of the box — and it’s amazing what they come up with! But remember to give space for it. People need time to learn which can be done through courses, coaching, conferences, etc. Whether that is via a “no meeting day” or through hack weeks, it’s important to give teams the space to grow. It’s an investment and an important way of shifting people’s mindset. 5. The key to a successful individual hire is curiosity and growth mindset. As long as you continuously find great people to surround yourself with, you will learn from them and put yourself in a position of growth. You can check capabilities and skill sets through resumes and high-level conversations, which will allow you to ensure that someone meets a minimum bar of being able to do the job. However, curiosity and a growth mindset allows one’s potential to be limitless. 6. Good managers recognize that their success comes from their team being successful. One of the best things a manager can do is hire someone who is better than themselves. You don’t need to be the utmost expert in all functions — hire people that are. Remember that teams should be dynamic, and you should fill the needs of a team — not just individual roles. And, ask for help; a good HR Partner and/or executive coach can be invaluable. 7. Evolution is key. If anything has reminded us of the need to adapt and evolve, it’s COVID-19. For example, what worked in the beginning of quarantine has become stale and we have needed to adjust and re-evaluate the way we approach things. You should apply this to process management as well. When you find that the effort to execute a process suddenly outweighs the value that you get, sit down and rethink how you might change it to solve the same problem. 8. Goal setting is more about alignment than tools or systems. Everyone should be pointing to the same North Star, with the same mission and top level goals, before diving into the execution of it and tools. 9. A company is only as good as the sum of its parts. When you have one functional area that is your strength (for example product or engineering), it is easy for a startup to make that the company’s North Star. However, you need to understand how every different function plays a key role in how you succeed. Being able to build empathy between different teams and understand how each team plays their part is important. Learning how to leverage them effectively and how to build understanding so people can partner will make an extraordinary impact. 10. When joining a new team, observe first — and then act. When you inherit a team, you shouldn’t just wipe it out, and reset. Sit down with the leaders and their direct reports, get to know the organization and the landscape, baseline it, and then figure out a meaningful goal of what they could achieve and a reasonable time period to do it. Hope you found as much value from these learnings as we did! We also gathered a few reading recommendations from Linda: Books The First 90 Days: Proven Strategies for Getting Up to Speed Faster and Smarter, Updated and Expanded by Michael D. Watkins Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration by Ed Catmull and Amy Wallace Think Big, Act Small: How America’s Best Performing Companies Keep the Start-up Spirit Alive by Jason Jennings Winning Now, Winning Later: How Companies Can Succeed in the Short Term While Investing for the Long Term by David Cote Sacred Hoops: Spiritual Lessons of a Hardwood Warrior by Phil Jackson and Hugh Delehanty (really hits home the point Linda made in the session around the power of we over me) Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us by Seth Godin Articles: Harvard Business Review: The Leader’s Guide to Corporate Culture: How to manage the eight critical elements of organizational life by Boris Groysberg, Jeremiah Lee, Jesse Price, and J. Yo-Jud Cheng Forbes: What Great Leaders Have The Good Leaders Don’t by Brent Gleeson Harvard Business Review: What Great Managers Do by Marcus Buckingham Enjoy, and hope to see you at the next Office Hours on December 16th!

I remember sitting in the second floor of the engineering building late into the night in front of an SGI Indigo workstation during grad school. The machine was a deep purple, and the keyboard was gray, and the screen showed a terminal with a little blinking green box. I spent many nights trying to figure out how to complete work with that little prompt. And now I find myself going back there. I’m not alone. There’s been a renewed interest in terminal-based applications. There seems to be an increased interest in the terminal as a UI again from founders. Maybe it’s from watching too many hacker movies and developing envy; or reading Dan Luu’s post on latency which proves that our faster, modern computers are slower to respond than the originals in the 1980s; but I like to think of it as a search for a simpler and more focused UI, and one without the mouse. I started with Vimium , a hugely popular Chrome extension that enables web navigation without touching the mouse. Then, I explored the Cloudinary command-line-interface (CLI) for uploading images that I use in the blog. The last few weeks, I’ve been using Mutt as a terminal based email client, and vim to write blog posts and notes from meetings that end up in Obsidian . Each step encourages the next one; it’s a quest for greater effectiveness. I’ve benefitted in a few ways from the journey. First, it’s much easier to focus on work. The terminal has far fewer distractions than the web, and not touching the mouse keeps me concentrated on the task at hand, more in flow. Second, things do happen faster, the UI is quicker to load and more responsive, so the machine feels closer to you because you’re not waiting on it so much. This is very much true on email. I started to realize I’m waiting several seconds for every web page to load, and every update to roundtrip from the server. Third, you can plunge into a vast ocean customization and configuration. For example, you can configure mutt to have some of the better features in Superhuman, like changing the to: field to bcc: when someone introduces you. Fourth, you are more powerful and you feel it. Complex tasks take less time, because you have direct access to the functionality and you can automate and repeat things quickly, like uploading a collection of images to a server, or formatting a large collection of files. Last, it’s like a living history lesson: it’s easy to see where many of the modern Gmail features and other modern programs originated. Rsync is the progenitor of Dropbox, for example. There are drawbacks. The learning curve is steep, and I mean precipitous. I had to learn vim first, and then I read piles of configuration examples to get things working properly. Most of the documentation isn’t great. I had to install many other programs to replicate web-based email’s functionality: the client, the address book look up, modern search, and then tame all of the configuration flags. Even then, the workflow can be a bit harder, especially for image pasting in email. There’s no dragging and dropping a screenshot into a terminal window. And to stick with it, you have to want to do it. Changing any behavior requires sufficient motivation. We’re entering a phase when most of the American workforce will have been born with a computer in their hand. User interfaces can and will become more sophisticated. Some UIs will mask complexity. Adobe Photoshop uses machine learning to outline a section of an image. Other UIs will expose more power to the end user directly. Tools like AlfredApp and Vimium already do. And because the number of digital native users will increase there will be valuable opportunities to serve them. That’s to say nothing of the PreCambrian explosion in the number of software engineers who used to number in the hundreds of thousands but today tally in the many millions, most of whom gravitate to the terminal already. Terminal based applications may not be for everyone, but the core ideas and the power and extensibility they offer will appear in many, many more products in the years to come.

On Wednesday, December 16th at 9:00 AM PT, Redpoint Office Hours will welcome Giancarlo ‘GC’ Lionetti , the CMO of Confluent, which was founded by the original creators of Apache Kafka® and pioneered the enterprise-ready event streaming platform. GC has led the rapid expansion of Confluent’s growth, marketing and developer relations functions. Confluent’s annual recurring revenue more than doubled year over year in 2019 and the company reached a $4.5 billion valuation for its recent $250 million Series E round. Previously, GC served as Vice President of Self-Serve Growth at Dropbox, and also led Product Marketing for the Developer Tools Division at Atlassian. Both companies were at hyper growth stages during his tenure. Travis is Head of Founder Experience at Redpoint and was formerly SVP of Global Sales at Optimizely and VP of Platform Sales at Salesforce. Patrick is an investor on Redpoint’s Early team and previously spent time as a Senior Software Engineer at LinkedIn. Travis, Pat, and GC will dive into the guts of building a Product-Led Growth function, discussing the following topics: What does the team look like? How do you think about hiring? What is the relationship between Growth, Marketing, Sales, and Product? How do you orchestrate the marriage of code and humans to drive a coordinated engagement with the customer?  And more! Interested in attending? Please register here before Wednesday, December 9th. This event will be virtual, and we will collect questions from participants beforehand and try to cover them throughout the discussion. We’ll also answer questions from the audience at the end of the session. We look forward to welcoming GC and engaging in great conversation!

“It’s the Finals. It’s hard. It’s supposed to be hard.” After Game 2 of the NBA Finals Steve Kerr said this to Steph Curry as they walked through the tunnel to the locker room after a loss. What’s true for basketball is also true for startups - at least in this case. With all the news of unicorns and IPOs and acquisitions driven by the broader market, teams can fall into a trap to think building a startup into a success is easier for others. But I can tell you more than 12 years into my career as a venture capitalist, it’s hard. It’s always hard. Even for the ones that make it look easy from the outside. We’ve had the privilege to partner with some iconic companies . Let me pull back the curtain: all of them have had their tough days. Missing a quarter. Failing to close a key hire. Receiving a rejection, or 20 nos, from potential financing partners. Struggling to re-energize after a derailed acquisition process. Fearing the rise of a competitor. Cutting costs to reduce burn and buy time to get the product right. Rebuilding trust after arguments amongst founders. Managing the psyche of a team throughout the rollercoaster of everyday startup life. Today, every company wrestles with one significant additional complexity: managing a remote team. How do you engage people over Zoom? Maintain the culture? Keep connected? Manage burnout? Those are the questions I hear in every board meeting. They’re real, meaningful, and challenging. It’s a startup. The company’s goal is to change the world, quite literally, by building a product, evolving user behavior, and sometimes creating a category. It’s hard. It’s meant to be hard. You’re changing the world.

For many years, I wrote notes on paper using the bullet journal method . It’s a method I still highly recommend. Now that my days are spent exclusively behind a computer, I’ve been searching for the right note-taking strategy. I recognize that note-taking is like pricing strategy: you never get it entirely right, so you’re always inclined to tinker. Niklas Luhmann invented an idea that’s taking off in many academic circles and beyond called Zettlekasten . The son of a German brewer, he published 58 books in 30 years and is heralded as one of the most important social theorists of the 20th century. His main innovation is to write small notes that cross-reference each other. Then, as new ideas emerge that reference each other, update these notes continually. Sönke Ahrens wrote a book called How to Take Smart Notes that explains the main and the method in great detail. In short, the system works this way Make a fleeting note: a short note of an idea with links to related ideas
Collect these notes into a synopsis and update them as more notes arrive.
Refine these into a rough draft.
Proofread and publish.
You can see the idea is to publish as much as possible, no surprise given Luhmann’s literary prolificacy. Today, we don’t need cards; we can use digital documents that link to each other. In effect, modern Zettlekasten is building our individual intranet of notes. Each one is linked to others by context (people, places, times, ideas). And importantly, they are bidirectional - which means you can navigate your notes the way you might surf Wikipedia. Roam Research and Obsidian.md are two of the most popular software companies building tools to support Zettlekasten. They have different philosophies. Roam focuses on note-taking, is web-based, and is closed-source. Obsidian is more focused on writing, is a local-client, and sort of open-source using markdown and local files with a promise to open source if the company winds down. Many years ago, I used VoodooPad, a freeware Mac app in the early 2000 that also works. I’ve chosen Obsidian because I prefer having a local copy of all my notes and in markdown since this blog is also in Markdown, but all are great. Also, there are significant communities around both Roam and Obsidian that help newcomers understand the features and the philosophies to maximize success. At the same time, these ideas are evolving quickly and it’s fun to be part of that change. After more than 6 months and thousands of notes, I can vouch for the method. The idea of linking people and companies to new startup spaces and new ideas has helped me compile research faster and also write blog posts more quickly. If you need to capture lots of ideas and link them together to recall them for some later purpose, give it a whirl and let me know what you think.

The rumor mill churns with whispers Salesforce will acquire Slack. This combination would be strategic for both involved for three reasons. First, Salesforce and Slack share Microsoft as their most significant competitor. Microsoft Teams’ rapid assault and consequent market power into the corporate instant messaging market transformed the market dynamics in less than 12 months. Microsoft has amassed the most extensive channel for SaaS companies, and each of these vendors pushes teams to current customers, many of whom are moving to the cloud and relying on Microsoft for guidance. Combining with Salesforce would enable Slack to sell through Salesforce account executives and the Salesforce channel in addition to their go-to-market efforts. The merger would establish a greater degree of parity in GTM muscle. Second, Slack + Salesforce enables superior integration of instant messaging workflows into this generation’s essential system of record. With Teams bundled into Microsoft cloud upgrades and often given away for free as part of a package deal, many CFOs wonder why companies ought to pay a premium for additional instant messaging software. This slash-and-burn market tactic has propelled Team’s rise in market share. But as instant messaging has evolved, many users and buyers have realized the most valuable mode d’emploi streamlines internal workflows. Better workflows rebut the premium instant messaging objection. The Slack ecosystem has blossomed with some startups leveraging the platform’s distribution. But imagine if Slack integrated natively into the entirety of the Salesforce ecosystem. Sales acceleration, marketing, finance tools all built on Salesforce data with Slack delivering the user interface. That’s justification for an upgrade. For Salesforce, the value proposition resonates, too. Today, AEs use Salesforce a few times per day at most - and then begrudgingly. Slack is a perpetual background process used many times per hour. User engagement could catalyze Salesforce upgrades. Salesforce benefitted from Chatter’s launch a decade ago. But there isn’t as much chatter on Chatter as Salesforce might have hoped. Slack remedies that deficiency instantly. Third, the next horizon for instant messaging is the development of custom workflows within large enterprises. These workflows require platforms-as-a-service (PaaS) products that simplify development. Engineers need databases and execution environments for this code. Microsoft has been pushing in this direction for the last nine months with Dataflex. Salesforce owns Heroku, a platform-as-a-service, that would serve as a developer-friendly substrate for engineers to develop key workflows that combine the Slack UI with Salesforce’s massive data repository and a broad ecosystem of inter-related marketing, finance, and sales data. Coincidentally, this thesis of combining messaging with custom workflows led to our investment in Mattermost , an open-source messaging platform focused on developer workflows like incident response, chat ops, and social coding. I believe in this convergence. For non-technical teams, a Salesforce and Slack merger would provide the ecosystem with a worthy competitor to Microsoft Teams and the broader Microsoft ecosystem. Plus, the combination would complement and reinforce the value propositions of both. If the merger does happen, it would reshape the SaaS landscape.

Despite the economic backdrop, startups continue to plow ahead. One of the biggest changes in the last year in the US is the Fed’s stated low interest rate policy for the next three years. What impact are we seeing in the market? Theory says lower interest rates means investors should shift from less risky to more risky assets to find the same level of return. If the government lends at a low rate, then the cost of capital is less, so companies should be able to invest more at the same cost, and grow faster. We should expect four outcomes: More money should enter venture capital funds. These are new dollars looking for yield. We should expect an increase in the valuations of rounds. Fast growing companies should be more valuable first because the demand has increased for their shares, and second because it’s lesse expensive to grow at the same rate. IPOs and M&A should increase because public market investors would like access to high-growth companies and acquirers would like to benefit both from their elevated valuations to buy companies with more valuable and demonstrate higher growth on their P&Ls. Let’s go through these one by one using the Pitchbook Venture Monitor Report . VCs have raised $57b through Q3, implying $75b for the year, a total which would eclipse any other year in the last decade. And it would be 4x the size of 2010. Check. The late stage venture market is on pace to set a record in 2020. Through Q3 2020, late stage investors have invested as much as the entirety of 2019, and should things continue linearly we should expect the final tally to exceed $100B. More dollars chasing higher growth, higher yield, and riskier investments. Also, the valuations of the top companies have more than doubled in an year from about $300m to $672m. When demand exceeds supply, prices increase. And we know from a previous analysis that the public markets price high growth B2B companies at more aggressive prices than the private markets . Check check. Last, 2020 is on track to set a record for total IPO proceeds in a year. And that doesn’t include Wish, Affirm, C3, Roblox, and AirBnB, who all filed this week. Check on IPOs. And prices of all exits (IPOs, buyouts, and M&A) have all increased with IPOs seeing the most appreciation. For founders and investors, a low rate policy charges an already frenzied environment further. Prices are higher, investment rounds larger, exits more valuable. And who knows where we’ll end up if rates do remain this low for another 2-3 years?

On Thursday, December 3rd at 11 AM PT, Redpoint Office Hours will welcome Linda Tong . Linda has lived an incredible path through startupland from Google, to startups, to the NFL, to AppDynamics. In some of our recent conversations, Linda has taught me about the differences in managing companies at radically different scales. Let me tell you a bit more about Linda’s history. Linda and I worked at Google at the same time, which is when I first met her. From there, she worked for TapJoy, the predominant mobile marketing company as their Chief Product Officer. From there, she became COO at Nextbit, a startup founded by an ex-Android team working working on mobile devices. Then, she joined the NFL as VP of Product where she managed the product vision for the digital properties of all 32 clubs and the league. Today she’s general manager of AppDynamics. Linda’s route through Startupland is unconventional for its breadth, variety, and success. Knowing Linda, it’s no surprise. What did surprise me are her views on the differences managing small teams and large teams, and how to do both successfully. In this Office Hours, Linda will share her stories and perspectives running hyper-growth startups and mammoth businesses. Please register to attend here before Wednesday , November 25th. This event will be virtual, and we will collect questions from participants beforehand and try to cover them throughout the discussion. We’ll also answer questions from the audience at the end of the session. We look forward to welcoming Linda and engaging in great conversation!

“More activity means more business. Don’t overthink it, just act…The target is dozens of net new interactions per week, building many shallow relationships. They aren’t fake, just shallow.” I have found this to be true. I like to think about it like Brownian motion: jiggle more atoms by talking to more people and there’ll be more activity all around you. Since sales is a funnel, the greater the activity at the top, the more sales. That’s how Founding Sales starts out. I read this book over the weekend really enjoyed it because of its matter-of-factness. The book’s ideas continue. I’m paraphrasing here. Modern sales is about seeking inefficiencies in the world, finding qualified prospects who have a business pain, but don’t know about the solution or need help to find it. It took me years to understand this idea. Not everyone has the time or dedication to constantly understand the best software in each part of their business. Salespeople are there to enlighten and distill. As my colleague Travis calls it, it’s a noble profession, meant to help someone solve their problem by sharing a perspective, an idea, a solution. There’s a section on structuring your presentation deck and the minimum viable elements to present. And how to create outbound lists, templates for those emails, tips on managing the inevitable rejection, and finally how to train and manage others. If you’re just starting out in sales, or are looking for a refresher on the day-to-day of selling, Founding Sales is excellent. The book has a straightforward perspective on how to sell well and in a modern way.

On the surface, B2B and B2C marketing may seem to be worlds apart. As open-source and developer-led companies become increasingly visible, important, and massive, we should draw the parallel between developer marketing and consumer marketing. They are much closer than it might seem. First, developer marketing is influencer and brand-driven. In the consumer World, consumer companies use luminaries to support a product. Michael Jordan and Air Jordans. Oprah Winfrey and Weight Watchers. Matthew McConaughey and the Lincoln ads that SNL spoofed . Famous developers using a product, writing about it confer a parallel social proof. Many developer-focused companies invite luminaries to invest in seed rounds. Another way to bestow cachet to an open-source project is to publish it while employed at an engineering powerhouse like Google, Facebook, Uber. Or from a top lab like Stanford’s DAWN or Berkeley’s RISE. Open source projects have memorable names: Python, Cockroach, Vagrant, Kafka, Kurbernetes, Hadoop, Arrow. They are memorable for a reason, so you hear about the project and remember it. Many of them choose animals as mnemonic mascots, helping recall. Narwhals, penguins, snakes, ants, elephants, ducks, lizards, camels. It’s a zoo - all in the name of creating a brand that sticks. Second, community engagement is essential in both consumer and developer marketing. There are a torrent of consumer examples. Perhaps the most recent one is Ocean Spray embracing a Fleetwood Mac lipsynching longboarder on TikTok. Developers gather in communities: Github, Slack, mailing lists, forums like StackOverflow, podcasts, and meetups. Managing those communities and cultivating them is an essential discipline in marketing to developers. Devrel or developer relations is often the first marketing hire for open-source or developer-focused companies to foster these interactions. Community alienation occurs in B2D companies just as frequently as B2C companies. Injecting telemetry into open source projects, forking key projects because of disagreements in philosophy, or improper management can be devastating. Third, in both domains, funnel optimization is critical. The small revenue per individual user for most consumer companies doesn’t permit marketers to deploy campaigns with long paybacks. The same is true for open-source or bottoms-up software. Greasing the axles for developers means great documentation, a vibrant community of people to answer questions and help with issues, and fast response times to queries. Fourth, broad distribution presages revenue. A social network doesn’t think of monetizing before it reaches a certain level of scale. At massive popularity, revenue growth is a foregone conclusion. Same for B2D. Many startups prioritize huge developer distribution, betting revenue follows. B2D and B2C marketing share many similarities. Classic B2B companies often struggle to understand, adopt, and leverage B2D marketing because it’s a cultural shift that is bigger than it might seem. The typical disciplines of analyst relations, field marketing support, product marketing are still important in B2D. But they need to be complemented with consumer marketing techniques to be successful.

I remember reading the Netflix culture deck published in 2009 and feeling inspired. The words on the page resonated with me because they conveyed a logic and thoughtfulness not often underpinning cultural decisions broadly. They are brave because they don’t appeal to everyone. Reed Hastings’ No Rules Rules delves one level deeper into the stories behind the deck. As I read the book, I was struck with the parallel Bridgewater’s values that founder Ray Dalio expounded in his book, Principles , and his memo to employees Netflix Bridgewater Say What You Really Think (With Positive Intent) Be Extremely Open, #3 Be radically candid, and follow the 4 As in your feedback (Aim to Assist, Actionable, Appreciate, Accept or Discard) Create a Culture in Which it is OK to Make Mistakes but Unacceptable not to Identify, Analyze and Learn from them, #8 Build Up Talent Density Look for people who sparkle, not just “another one of those”, #60 Pay top of market Pay for the person, not the job, #61 Act in Netflix’s best interest Think like an owner, and expect the people who work for you to the same, #74 If a person on your team were to quit tomorrow, would you try to change their mind? If not, give them a severance package now. (Keeper Test) When you find that someone is not a good “click” for a job, get them out of it ASAP., #129 The largest modern media company and the largest modern hedge fund in the world share quite a few management precepts. Do these cultures work? To answer that question, we need to raise another one should one evaluate a culture? First, in terms of financial success, one can’t argue with the growth of either of these institutions. Bridgewater manages $100B, more than any other hedge fund. Netflix has increased its value by 100x in the 15 years. Second, these cultures engender a powerful sense of belonging or rejection. You either belong or you don’t, which streamlines interviewing processes and management discussions. The data supports this idea. Netflix employees are the most satisfied with their pay and least likely to look elsewhere, according to this survey . Third, both of these institutions’ cultures are respected and revered. And we’re reading books about them, contrasting them, debating them. But there’s another side to the story: reading Glassdoor reviews for each company illuminates the counterpoint of this culture. Some employees fear for their jobs, others mention challenging politics, yet others a lack of work-life balance. Not everyone thrives in cultures like these. No culture satisfies everyone. And that’s exactly the point: cultures are meant to find, keep, and reward the people who belong in a group. The brilliance and the bravery of both Hastings and Dalio is the confidence to express pointed views of the culture with which they operate their businesses, and to hold fast despite the trade-offs.

An IT executive recently asked me this question. How many technologies can a company adopt at once, successfully? It’s a question I hadn’t paused to contemplate before that moment. And if you are a vendor, it’s not one that you think about very often either. But if you are a member of the IT team, it’s top of mind every day. There are two answers to this question. The first is my initial response to the asker: change management limits the pace. How quickly an IT team can train people, onboard them, and make them successful with all the different technologies procured by a central unit. How fast the company can change behavior. The second answer is that the company can absorb an infinite number of technologies - if it flips the model. Instead of IT managing change, each employee learns the technologies they need at their own pace. We see an absolute explosion in the number and the diversity of software solutions because of this type of empowerment. No IT team has the time to understand all the individual needs for each employee’s workflow at every level of a company. In the world of education, this concept is called the Flipped Classroom . Students take charge of their education, and the teacher becomes a guide. The parallel between education and software runs deep. By empowering employees to manage their toolkits and advancement, the number of technologies a company adopts explodes. Though more software implies complexity, the strategy works because the decision-making is pushed deeper into the organization. We’ve all read reports about the average number of SaaS products in use at the typical company is growing from 50 to 200 or more. This is why.  To compete and win means adopting as many of the best technologies as quickly as possible through decentralized purchasing and change management.

I used to think of a startup as a series of funnels . There’s the customer conversion funnel, the recruiting funnel, the customer success funnel. Funnels simplify metrics. Examine the yield from each stage to gauge success. Start to finish. I’ve been preparing my session for the NY Enterprise Tech Meetup later this week on the Essential Guide to SaaS Metrics. Thinking through that presentation and reflecting on some recent conversations, I’ve changed my belief. The superior mental model is a cycle. The funnel stops at an end state. The cycle is a flywheel and builds momentum. That’s the key difference. Attract a customer, engage them, sell them a contract, onboard them, ensure they achieve their objective. That’s the funnel. But add a step: solicit a testimonial, ask for a referral to a friend, cross-sell another product. The cycle starts again. Attract a talented candidate, engage them, hire them, onboard them. That’s the end of the people funnel, but not the people cycle. Startups should manage, cultivate, and foster their employees, and this will drive the cycle again with referrals, better employee brand, and greater success with future candidates. Modern leaders in each of the critical functions of startup teams have been telling me this for a while, describing it in different forms. But it took time to settle in. Measuring the funnel is the first step, but not enough. We have to measure the cycle and the strength of the flywheel. That’s the lens I’ll be using from now on: cycles not funnels.

Most high-growth software investors value public companies on enterprise value to forward revenue multiple. But investors in private companies use a different metric, enterprise value to forward annual recurring revenue (ARR).The private markets project the ARR a year from now. The public markets project revenue for the next 12 months What if we could compare the relative valuation multiples of public and private high growth software companies? What conclusions could we draw? It’s possible with some estimation. To estimate ARR for a public company, we annualize the analyst consensus estimates for the revenue 4 quarters from today. The chart above shows the median enterprise value to forward ARR value since 2016. It hovers around 5x until 2018, then spikes to 8x, and despite some volatility, reaches its current zenith at a bit more than 10x. The valuation multiple has doubled in about two years. But this figure includes companies growing at differen rates. Let’s bucket these businesses by growth to see trends. Public software companies growing under 30% haven’t benefitted from this multiple expansion. But those growing more than 30% and especially those over 50% are a different story. A company growing 50% or more annually has enjoyed a nearly 6x growth in forward ARR multiple. This has pushed valuations ever higher in software. Let’s excise this group of 50% growers from the rest and add Redpoint internal data for forward ARR multiples for later-stage companies, which are all growing above 50%. In 2017 and 2018, the median high-growth private company raised at a higher forward ARR multiple than in the public markets. Starting in 2019 and continuing in 2020, the public markets value these companies with better multiples. This is a critical shift. It means raising capital in the public markets is now less expensive than in the private markets. In 2018, I wrote Access is the Scarcest Commodity in Startupland ,which reviewed historical data to prove the point that the liquidity premium that used to exist in the public markets had been replaced with an access premium in the private markets. In software for at least the last few years, the public market premium is back after a multi-decade hiatus. And if it continues, we should expect the IPO, the direct listing, and special purpose acquisition vehicles (SPACs) to present compelling financing options to later stage founders.

Each quarter, a group of analysts, including me, publish analysis on the trends in the venture capital market. There’s a risk to those assessments: the data is incomplete since not all rounds founders close within a quarter are reported in that quarter. I was curious about how much variance exists in the data. This retrospective analysis compares Crunchbase data from April 1, 2020 to data from October 10, 2020 across three dimensions: round counts, investment total, and median round size. The red lines show data from Q2 and the blue line Q4. Let’s start with round counts. The earlier the stage, the greater the delta. And of course, the earlier data under-reports the total round numbers. In the seed stage, Q2 data reported 427 rounds compared to 719 in Q4. For Series Cs, the round count increased from 74 to 76. Let’s look at those on a percentage basis. The seed round counts from the day after quarter close counted 60% of the rounds, missing 40%. Series A is 12%, Series B is 10%, and Series C is about 2%. The earlier the round, the greater the likelihood the round isn’t reported. At the seed, it’s basically a coinflip that it will be reported. Moving onto total dollars invested, the lines hug each other closely. The total invested in the seed market shows an uptick in the Q4 data. Aside from that, the later rounds have very little whitespace between them, indicating high precision. On a percentage basis, the total dollars invested are significantly closer. The delta between the two data sets shows 22% at seed, 2% at Series A, 6% at Series B, and 8% at Series C. Single-digit accuracy is impressive for the speed of the data for A rounds and beyond. Seed inaccuracy persists here. Last is median investment size. The Q2 data showed a massive spike in median seed round size. The later rounds were much closer except for Q3 2019 in Series As. In percentage terms, seed is off the charts. A, B, and C are within 10%.
So we have a consistent pattern. Immediate data is within 12% accuracy on the three key metrics for Series A, B, & C. Seed is wild, and any analysis evaluating quarter over quarter trends in the seed market should have substantial confidence intervals around it, or the analysis should wait for a quarter or two to draw conclusions. The data is skewed because there are many smaller seeds that aren’t reported within the quarter. The bigger seeds are reported, which is the cause of the median seed round spike, and the relatively narrow miss on total invested but huge miss on round counts. Take heart that these variances also occurred during a period of tremendous background macroeconomic volatility, and still the Series A and later figures are still within 10%. But, take any sequential quarterly analysis on seed trends with a massive dose of skeptical patience. The data is still coming in.

Public software companies trade on forward revenue multiples. Investors contrast the relative value of one business by comparing the enterprise value divided by forward revenue (sum of the next 12 months’ revenue) of one business to another.  Ten years ago, forward multiples remained in a tight band between 5-10x. Today, they span 2-60x+. This novel dispersion provides us an opportunity to ask some interesting questions. Let’s cover one today: does the market price efficiently? We know revenue growth rate correlates most with forward multiples . If we divide the forward multiple by the growth rate, we normalize it, which means we can compare them on a pineapples-to-pineapples basis Here they are plotted. The FMG (forward-multiple-growth ratio) spans 0.06 to 0.86. A massive difference. Let’s look at one of the top companies. Adobe’s FMG of 0.86 means the forward multiple is the fourth most expensive in terms of growth rate. Each point of revenue growth is 0.86 added to the multiple. Zoom is in the bottom third at 0.29, meaning its forward multiple is less costly than most. The correlation between FMG and revenue growth is zero (-0.097). This means the most expensive companies aren’t the ones that are growing the fastest. I correlated the top 7 metrics to the FMG score to see if there was another factor at play across the data set, but none were significant. The market isn’t pricing modern software companies well if pricing them principally on forward multiple. The market has focused on forward multiples for the last 15 years. Net Dollar Retention rose in the last five or so. But we really ought to be considering the FMG ratio to understand relative valuations. The price of a percentage point of revenue growth for one software company vs another should be relatively similar, but today, there’s a 10x span, which suggests inefficient pricing.

I’ve been steadily progressing through the excellent books in the Stripe Press catalog . First, I read High Growth Handbook. Most recently, I read An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management by Will Larson . It’s the best book I’ve read on engineering management. Will has worked at Digg, Uber, Stripe, and is now at Calm and has seen many engineering teams endure and thrive through hypergrowth. The book abstracts out the wisdom of those times into theory abstracted from experience, not just hypothetical ideas. Will extends the concepts of systems thinking into engineering management. The 4 states of an engineering team is a mental model that resonated with me, and I think it provides a framework for leadership teams and boards to understand the state of a developer team. The four states are: Falling Behind - every week, the team’s backlog deepens. The list of bugs and feature requests outstrips the team’s ability to offset them with releases. It’s time to recruit engineers to add throughput to the team. Morale is low. Treading Water - the team sustains a good pace, but can’t embark on new projects or reduce technical debt. The solution is to reduce concurrent work (called Work in Progress in systems theory), so drive faster throughput by focusing on team projects rather than individual work. Repaying Debt -  to pay down debt, the team needs more time to invest in reducing the debt. Innovating - craft enough slack in the system to enable the team to transition to this phase, invest in good quality code. The state of an eng team can be opaque from the outside, and this framework illuminates the status in a simple way. It’s just one example of why An Elegant Puzzle is such a great book. But there’s much more. Recently, many startups have tried to measure engineering throughput. Will uses systems thinking to measure productivity by looking at the engineering pipeline of pull requests, ready commits, deployed commits as a funnel with code review rates, deploy rates, and defect rates, amongst other figures. Team reorganization is a prickly topic but the book illustrates how to handle it with aplomb, step-by-step. If you manage engineering teams or are a startup leadership member, I highly recommend reading Will Larson’s book. The mental models and frameworks are broadly applicable and useful.

Recently, we welcomed Kimber Lancaster to Office Hours at Redpoint to discuss running successful virtual events. It was a fantastic session in which Kimbre surfaced counterintuitive insights about one of the most critical marketing channels of 2020. Below, I’ve summarized some of my notes from the session. First, there’s much more crossover between physical and virtual events than most people think. The planning phase for virtual events parallels physical events. When you begin planning the virtual event, start with the event’s goals and the audience’s desires. Develop the messaging for your audience. Identify compelling speakers to further the cause. Declare metrics for success. Not having to visit venues and plan for catering are the biggest differences and timesavers. You may also need to change your AV team, prep the speakers’ home video quality, and pre-record sessions. Audience engagement rose to the top of the questions list from the audience. Kimbre shared with us that she used to be a professional theater performer. When starting a performance, actors teach the audience how to engage.  The best comedians teach the audience the cadence of jokes, when to expect a punchline, and when to laugh. Speakers can choreograph this back-and-forth to great success. With virtual events, start every conference teaching the audience how to engage. Run a silly poll at the outset to teach attendees how to use tools. Encourage speakers to deliver presentations that require audience engagement. Some events have used slack as a communication tool. At Failover Conf, presenters engaged with the audience through Slack channels after their sessions. Pre-recording speaker sessions is a new and important technique. Imagine the disaster if a speaker’s internet fails during a talk. By pre-recording sessions, event organizers can ensure the event runs smoothly. Some virtual events pre-record all sessions and then have this speaker engaging with the audience live. I’m grateful that Kimbre shared all these wonderful insights with us. If you’d like to read about the session in more detail and with the full transcript, please see the post on the Redpoint blog . And if you’d like to get in touch with Kimbre, you can find her here .

High growth software companies are valued based on forward revenue multiples. In other words, to calculate the enterprise value of a business, you multiply the revenue by the forward multiple. But, how does the market set the multiple? What predicts the forward multiple, or correlates with it? I pulled together the data for the basket of the roughly 60 publicly traded SaaS companies and ran a linear regression to understand the predictive power of the many key metrics reported by public companies. The answer: revenue growth and sales efficiency dominate the model. Cash flow margins, net income margins (profitability), gross margins, and many other metrics are largely irrelevant. Revenue growth correlates with forward multiple at 0.81. Sales efficiency isn’t far behind at 0.75. If you’d like to predict the forward multiple for the next software company to file their S-1, use this formula. Forward Multiple = 6.3 + 38 x Revenue_Growth + 2 x Sales Efficiency . It should get you within 20% of the forward multiple observed in the market today. By popular demand, here are definitions: Revenue growth - year over year growth in revenue Gross margin - gross profit divided by revenue Cash flow margins - cash flow from operating activities divided by revenue Net income margin - net income divided by revenue Sales efficiency - (gross_profit_this_year - gross_profit_last_year)/selling_and_marketing_expense_last_year

The Economist ran a story about the future of work this week. Working remotely, we have reduced meeting length by about 15% and increased our total time at work by 2 hours per day.  We might declare we have found an extra 10 hours in the workweek from nothing. This productivity boost might seem universally positive, but there’s a catch. One of the critical topics in many boardrooms today is managing employee burnout. Sheltering-in-place, managing schooling, healthcare for elderly family members are just a few things that have become more difficult. Working longer hours while managing these stressors may compound the exhaustion. Christina Maslach is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. And she’s published research on burnout. There’s an excellent summary of her research here. There are six progenitors of burnout : work overload, lack of control, insufficient reward, breakdown of community, absence of fairness, and value conflict. Three are more relevant today.  We are more susceptible to work overload (since we’re putting in 25% more hours). It’s hard to feel in control today, given the health and socio-economic backdrop. And, the high definition video doesn’t quite capture a feeling of community, even in 720p. What are the signs of burnout? Exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. There are tests for evaluating burnout and work engagement. Here’s an assessment from Maslach’s article in the Stanford Social Innovation Review . There are other tests included one called the UWES (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale) is detailed here . It distinguishes between work engagement and burnout. There’s a wealth of research to better understand burnout, and given all the stressors employees face today, startups may be well served to explore ways of assessing burnout and mitigating it.

Many companies today pursue a pincer GTM. First, target the individual user and then convince the economic buyer, typically a manager, director, or VP depending on the scale. Two constituents in the sales motion, but only one website raises a conundrum. Who do you serve on the home page? Technical products often face this two persona quandary. And it surfaces on the website because of the constraint of a single home page. Successful marketing builds trust . Building trust with engineers is entirely different than building trust with marketers. Engineers prefer to spend time in Github evaluating a product’s technical prowess, in the documentation to learn how to wield the technology, and in the forums understanding the nature of the community. Technical acumen, applied content marketing, and superlative documentation build that trust. But don’t apply the same approach with a VP Marketing or Sales and expect success. There’s a front door to a website and a side door. Both are equally important, but each door is for a different constituency. The front door is for direct traffic, for the persona that navigates to a site because they’ve searched for the company or received an email with the website. The side door is the pathway of deep links. The side door leads to documentation, blog posts, community brought via referral. When I wrote code, I spent time on developer forums and communities. I would read blog posts that would link to other posts and eventually product documentation or tutorial videos. A modern engineer probably spends the same or more time on StackOverflow or dev.to or DataScienceCentral today as I did ten years ago. The best technical marketers make that part of the site as appealing as possible: theming the site differently for developers (dark mode is quite appealing), investing time in the best possible documentation with examples that are easily copy/pasted, and a vibrant community to troubleshoot issues swiftly. The homepage of the website can be targeted another persona. They are typically filled with social proofs like logo walls and case studies to establish credibility in a different way. After that credibility is established, these pages describe the problem and the solution at the highest levels to provide executive sponsors context and comfort as they progress through the purchasing cycle. And they also serve as massive lead generation engines with whitepaper download forms or email capture fields. Look to Hashicorp , LaunchDarkly , Twilio among others as examples. Front-door is social proof and high level vision. Side-door is documentation. If your business pursues a pincer GTM, define your personas, understand their pathways to your website and tailor the content to each.

Where is the SaaS world relative to how far it can go? With valuations of as-a-service companies and all-time highs or close to it, and more and more startups leveraging this model to serve an ever-larger number of consumers, I wondered how much more business is there to capture? Let’s try to estimate. We do have enough data to get a sense of total as a service penetration. Last year, Zylo published a study suggesting that the average business spends about 10,000 dollars per year on as-a-service (aaS) software. There are approximately 120m workers in the US. Today, sixty percent of which are white-collar workers. Assuming a $10k SaaS budget per year per worker, we obtain a theoretical market size of about $720b annually. How does that compare to market research? Gartner’s research contends aaS spending in 2019 totaled $228B. 32% of the potential market has migrated to as-a-Service. How much value has that $228B generated in terms of market cap?  According to our internal analysis, the average forward multiple of a modern software company is about 12.8x.  Gartner projects $266b in as-a-service spend this year. So, theoretically, aaS has created $3.8t in market cap. How does that compare to reality? Summing the value of all the pure-play aaS companies yields $1.2t. Assume one-third of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft market cap is as-a-service value; that adds another $1.3t for a total of $2.5t. Where is the missing $1.3t? It’s probably inaccuracy in the Gartner spend measurement, no consideration of international software spend, and undercounting in the market cap analysis. In any case, if we were to assume a terminal aaS penetration of 60%, aaS companies have the opportunity to generate another $2.5-3.7t in market cap. And this doesn’t account for the new software spend as vertical SaaS reaches deeper and more businesses modernize. Another 13 Salesforces or Zooms. 48 Workdays. 250 Zendesks. However you count it, the opportunities in aaS remain massive.

When a new leader joins a startup, their impact hinges on their ability to build their teams. Whether you manage a team of engineers, a team of regional sales managers, or the company, your first responsibility is to hire and successfully manage the seven people who will form your leadership team. Managers who hire those seven people - either from talent inside the company or outside the company - will be more effective. Why? First, as a company grows, the most important thing is recruiting. If you have a leadership team of seven recruiting on your behalf, you will be way more effective than someone with only two or three managers. Second, a leadership team will have the capacity to focus on many more important topics than a team of two or three people. The combination of more throughput and greater specialization should lead to better results. Third, different perspectives on a team drive better decisions. Whether your mental model is Bezos’ two-pizza teams or Lew Cirne’s only-the-people-who-fit-around-this-table should be here, there’s truth to the effectiveness of small teams. Small enough to move fast, but broad enough to bring a breadth of perspective. I picked the number 7 because it’s the most common span of control in management. We’ve also identified empirically verified that this number correlates with better quota attainment at least within sales teams in our GTM survey. But some teams operate with four, five, six, eight or ten. Irrespective of the actual number, the point is great managers prioritize building that team. I’ve seen this in practice at many of our companies. When a new leader is hired, the difference in their impact hinges on their ability to build their teams.

On Tuesday, September 15th at 10 AM PT, Redpoint will welcome Kimbre Lancaster as the next co-host of Office Hours. Kimbre is the former Director of Global Events and Field Marketing at Gremlin where she managed the industry sponsorships program, Gremlin’s produced conferences (Chaos Conf, Failover Conf) and the new remote field program. Prior, she built and scaled the programs at both Split and Scalyr. During the presentation, we will cover the keys to success for hosting virtual events, including building audiences, managing sponsors, and programming. We have seen the lead generating potential of virtual events across our portfolio , and we believe this type of marketing will become essential in the next decade. This Office Hours will be a virtual event. We will collect questions from participants beforehand and try to cover them throughout the discussion. We’ll also answer questions from the audience at the end. If you’re interested in attending, please apply here before Tuesday, September 8th.  Once your registration has been received, you will be sent an email confirmation by Wednesday, September 9th. We look forward to welcoming Kimbre and engaging in a great conversation!

How do you tell if your sales team and marketing team are working well together? There’s a simple diagnostic that I’ve come to use. Compare the slopes of marketing’s lead generation efforts to sales’ bookings trajectory. The marketing pipeline trend should be the pipeline for this quarter, pipeline that’s available to close (ATC). ATC is a concept I learned from Lambert Billet, the CRO at Looker. It means the prospect will buy this quarter. Sometimes, teams report aggregate pipeline generated, but prospects ready to buy 12 months from now aren’t relevant. If the marketing slope is up and the bookings slope is up, the teams are aligned. Ideally, the marketing slope is greater than the sales slope, which means the marketing team generates more pipeline than sales can close. If the slopes are identical, that’s fine too. Marketing sources enough pipeline for sales to hit their numbers. If the marketing slope is up, and the sales slope is flat to down, then there’s a disconnect between marketing and sales. This is the most common scenario in startups. There’s a problem with the handoff between marketing and sales. Some potential causes: Marketing focuses efforts on non-ICP prospects. A product leader at a B2B marketing mega-cap shared with me only 7% of marketing spend is targeted to sales prospects, which is why ABM has become so popular. Marketing efforts may not be well qualified. Many demand generation marketers focus on SQLs rather than MQLs as their target metric to align themselves better with the sales team to mitigate this. The initial marketing pitch resonates, but the product fails to deliver, or the sales team isn’t trained well enough yet to close the customer. There are many potential causes here. These are just some of them that I have observed. Regardless, if the slopes have this configuration, it’s worth spending time to understand the issue better. Marketing slope is down but sales slope is up is a rarer configuration. But it is possible. These are some possibilities: Presages a decline in bookings rate because the sales team is converting older pipeline. Sales sources the majority of leads through outbound, and marketing isn’t a meaningful contributor. This may be possible in large ACV products where outbound sales can be up to 80% of lead generation. When analyzing the ratios of lead generation and sales bookings, it’s worth looking at the share of leads generated by marketing vs. sales. I’ve seen companies with 80% sales sourced leads and others with 80% marketing sourced leads.

Asana filed their S-1 this week. Asana builds productivity and task management solutions. When they launched, their vision of eliminating email through task management made big waves in the market. Today, the company is a massively successful SaaS business and another example of the flywheel business model that creates demand at the individual user and leverages that interest to sell department and company-wide contracts. Asana competes with SmartSheet, another publicly traded productivity company. In this analysis, I’ve compared the metrics of the two companies at the time of IPO. Also, I’m trying a new format for these analyses that you might call a baseball card analysis, rather than a series of charts. Let me know which you prefer. Metric SmartSheet Asana IPO Year 2018 2020 Customers 74,000 75,000 ACV 1503 2165 TTM Revenue, $M 111 142 Revenue Growth 66.1% 85.8% Gross Margin 80.5% 86.1% Net Income Margin -48% -83% Operating Cash Flow Margin -12% -13% Smartsheet went public in 2018. Since its IPO, Smartsheet has increased its market cap 2.6x to $6.3B today, which is a favorable omen for Asana. At the time of IPO, Asana and Smartsheet had the same number of customers, about 75,000. Asana records a contract size advantage of about 44%, with an ACV of $2165. Each seat costs $118 per year or $9.83 per month on average. At the time of IPO, Asana generates more revenue,  $162M in revenue to Smartsheet’s $111M. Asana is also growing faster, 86% annual revenue growth vs. SmartSheet’s 66%. The cost of higher growth appears in the Net Income Margin delta. Asana generates about 2x the loss of SmartSheet as a percentage of revenue. However, Asana’s cash flow margin from operations is 13 percentage points better, meaning customer pre-payment terms from customers and cash collections may be superior. Asana holds a 6 percentage point lead in gross margin, likely a benefit borne of modern software architecture and the cost advantages it brings. Metric SmartSheet Asana Net Dollar Retention 130% 120% Sales Efficiency 0.92 1.15 Implied Payback Period, months 13.1 10.5 S&M Spend / Revenue 0.66 0.74 R&D Spend / Revenue 0.34 0.63 Examining SaaS ratios, we see Asana charts lesser net dollar retention than SmartSheet. In the S-1, Asana clarifies larger accounts expand more. Accounts worth $5k or more grow at 130% and accounts paying $50k or more expand at 140%. This data is consistent with the Redpoint survey that found median NDR is greater with bigger ACVs. Asana’s sales efficiency or magic number is 25% better than SmartSheet, meaning Asana’s go-to-market requires one quarter less sales and marketing spend to acquire a customer. The inverse of this number, normalized for months, is the implied cost-of-customer acquisition payback period. Asana pays back its sales and marketing outlay in 10.5 months compared to Smartsheet at 13 months. This figure is burdened for gross margin. Asana runs less profitably because of meaningfully bigger investments in both Sales & Marketing (S&M) and Research and Development (R&D). Asana invests 10% more of its revenue in S&M, which is consistent with its higher growth rate. But R&D spend is of a different magnitude. Asana spends almost 2x the percentage of revenue on R&D compared to Smartsheet: 64%. Of all the companies I’ve analyzed, this is the second largest to Hortonworks. Company R&D Spend as a Percentage of Revenue Hortonworks 78.7% Asana 63.0% Workday 46.1% Atlassian 44.0% Slack 39.3% Notably, Slack and Atlassian also fall into the top 5, and both of these businesses are flywheel models as well, so there’s some precedent for this type of investment. In addition, the high sales efficiency should reassure skeptics that this technology investment has paid go-to-market dividends, as well as superior gross margins. SmartSheet trades at 15x forward revenues as of this writing. Assuming a 15% decline in Asana’s growth rate and a similar valuation multiple, I would expect Asana to trade around $4B or higher. The company should fetch a premium for faster growth, better gross margins, and superior sales efficiency. Congratulations to the entire Asana team on building a productivity powerhouse.

Demand generation limits growth. To scale, a company must find customers in ever larger numbers. The ideal scenario is one where purely external signals confer a prospect’s propensity to buy. A prospect experiences hypergrowth is perfect example. Massive headcount growth presages large software purchases and expansion. A company anoints a new department head catalyzing change. The more external the signal of lead quality, the easier the demand generation task will be. External signals are powerful proxy metrics . Most of the time, these external signals won’t suffice. Internal data points are critical additions: adoption of new infrastructure technology, dissatisfaction with an incumbent vendor, budget availability, or a new project or initiative. Mnemonic frameworks like BANT (Budget, Need, Authority, Timing) and MEDDIC (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Process, Decision Criteria, Identify Pain, Champion) remind sellers to solicit these internal signals during qualifying calls. This data collection is one reason salespeople are critical to many sales processes. There’s another form of signal that’s very powerful: product qualification . The product qualified lead or PQL has been around a long time. Entice users to use a product, encourage usage and internal cross-pollination, then use data to prioritize leads for the sales team, which is none other than Kenny van Zant’s flywheel model . Most bottoms up SaaS companies with smaller ACVs use product qualification to grow because outbound prospecting or other demand generation techniques aren’t economically viable. Plus, product-led growth is a powerful competitive moat. Whatever technique(s) you decide to use, I’d encourage you to think early about finding those proxy metrics for good prospects. The earlier the business can determine them, the more focused and productive demand generation efforts will be.

Rippling published their fundraising deck. Within it, Adil Syed, (a former Redpoint VC!), introduced a gem of a new metric : month zero cash-on-cash payback. It’s not a metric one sees very often in pitch decks. But it’s another metric to add to the toolkit. Month Zero Cash-on-Cash Payback is a mouthful. Let’s dub it ZCP for Zero Cash Payback to save us from the more evident but unwieldy MZCoCP. Where does ZCP fit into the panoply of metrics for SaaS companies? It’s a cash accounting metric, not an accrual accounting metric . The income statement or P&L is accrual accounting and recognizes revenue over the life of a contract. Cash accounting is the amount of money in the bank. ZCP’s accrual accounting pair partner is the magic number. Both the magic number and NCP measure the efficiency of the go-to-market teams. The magic number answers the question: if we invest $1 in sales and marketing, how much new bookings can we generate? ZCP answers the question: if we invest $1 in sales costs (e.g., salaries & sales commissions), how long does it take to recoup that dollar and see it in our bank account? If we can pay a sales team $1 today and regain it this month, the ZCP is 1. Quoting from the deck, “The sales team can be expanded without increasing burn.” As the ZCP approaches zero, the cost of the sales team and expanding it increases until it reaches the total cost of the sales teams. Swings in the ZCP are going to be non-linear. If the sales team overperforms and attains accelerators, commission payments will increase, and ZCP will fall. If the sales team underperforms meaningfully, cash collections will fall, but so will commissions. Other swing factors include multi-year deals with upfront payments and enterprise contracts that have delayed start dates. This volatility means the metric is likely best used as a trailing average on a quarterly basis, rather than monthly, unless your sales team is highly consistent. The ZCP is a metric for understanding the cash impact of growing a sales team.

On Wednesday, August 26th at 9 AM Pacific, Redpoint Office Hours will welcome Tyler McNally, the VP of Customer Experience at Gainsight. My partner, Jamin Ball, will be leading the discussion. He provides weekly data driven analysis of SaaS companies on his blog Clouded Judgement . During the presentation, we will cover customer success trends and how they impact early stage B2B SaaS companies, share our point of view on how early-stage customer success drives growth, and provide a “game plan” that focuses on the key things to get right from the get-go. This Office Hours will be a virtual event. We will collect questions from participants beforehand and try to cover them throughout the discussion. We’ll also answer questions from the audience at the end. If you’re interested in attending, please apply here before Wednesday, August 19th.  Once your registration has been received, you will be sent an email confirmation by Thursday, August 20th. We look forward to welcoming Tyler and engaging in a great conversation!

After I wrote a post on the health of the seed market during COVID , AngelList Venture emailed me saying they observed different patterns in their early-stage data and offered to collaborate. This data set is unique because it records transacted deals on the AngelList platform. The first post highlighted a 40% reduction in seed investment in Q2 2020 and 42% increase in Series A investment, quarter over quarter. AngelList data shows different patterns. First, across pre-seed, seed, and Series A, round volumes are flat-to-up quarter over quarter. Second, round sizes are down about 20-30% from highs in the pre-seed and seed market. Series As’s ascent continues unperturbed. Last, the AngelList team provided data on pre-money valuations, which is rare data! We see pre-seeds have fallen from mid-2018 highs of $10m to about $5m. Seeds persist at $10m pre-money. And Series As oscillate around $30M over the last two years. This data set suggests the seed market is healthy and exhibits resiliency in contrast to the Crunchbase data set. I reviewed my previous analysis, searching for geographic and other demographic differences to explain some of the data sets’ variances. But I couldn’t find a variable that would explain the difference. I also reviewed other data sets including the NVCA’s Venture Monitor, which suggested Series A deal pace is down about 30%, a third perspective. Here are some ideas: There are definitional differences between Seeds, As between the  data sets. There is latency in startups reporting closed rounds. This latency skews more Seed than Series A. Eg, startups that raise As are louder sooner. The data sets capture two different populations of investors whose behaviors differ. I’m reminded of the five blind men and the elephant. Some data sources show the trunk, others the belly, and others the tail. In a few quarters, we’ll understand the true nature of market perturbations triggered by COVID. But today, we’re still sketching out the nature of the beast.

In 2017, I wrote the post Managers Must be Insane to Brainstorm in Groups . If you’ve been a group meeting for brainstorming, you’ll identify with the three problems reasearchers identified with in-person brainstorms: Only one person can speak at a time. Many people don’t participate and free ride hiding in the back of the room, unengaged. Some attendees are glossophobes: they fear speaking in public.  And you’ll resonate with the frustration of this meeting format. Remote work changes this for brainstorming meetings and collaboration broadly defined. The secret is Google Docs. Imagine we’re working together, and it’s time to brainstorm ideas for the new product we’re going to launch. You schedule a meeting for the relevant people from sales, product, marketing, engineering, and customer support. There might be ten people in the room. In person, this session would be a disaster, guaranteed. But, you change the format since the team attends virtually. You create a Google document with ten pages, a page with each person’s name on top. You ask everyone in the meeting to find the page with their name on it and answer the question: “what are the top three features our new product needs?” in the first ten minutes. Time’s up; hands-off keyboards. You coalesce the lists in front of everyone. By the time you’ve completed your work, the team has read the others’ contributions and is ready to discuss. The group steps through the bullet items in the remaining time. We’ve solved all three problems of in-person brainstorming. First, everyone writes in parallel. Second, no one freeloads because everyone must write. Third, there’s no public speaking involved (introverts rejoice!). And I’ll add one. Fourth, everyone has context because they’ve all read each others’ ideas. Try it. You’ll be amazed. I was. I’ve participated in sessions like this for brainstorming, 360° reviews, project planning, pipeline evaluation, team standups, all kinds. Each session is remarkably more productive than in person. It’s just better. Everyone has been heard. Alignment across stakeholders is ensured. And you’ve documented the work in case the team should share beyond those in attendance.

In my recent post about the fundraising market during COVID, I wondered aloud about inside rounds . Inside rounds, new financing rounds led by existing investors, have historically been primarily the territory of companies who cannot raise from outside investors at attractive terms. But recently, insiders have been leading the most competitive rounds in their portfolio companies. Or at least, that was my perception. What does the data say? This is a collection of six charts. Each row shows the mean and the median round size for US startups over the last 10 years. Each chart shows the difference in round size led by existing investors in red and new investors in blue. One note before we go step-by-step through the charts. We should expect mean/average round size to be higher than medians. Round sizes skew left . There are many more small rounds than large rounds for a given series. But the large rounds are enough to pull, aka skew, the mean higher than the median to the right (higher). Series A means haven’t changed much. There is a relatively consistent premium to outside rounds led by new investors over inside rounds. The medians are roughly the same over the decade. Again, this has to do with the skew. We would expect this pattern if insiders were not aggressive about leading inside rounds in the most attractive companies. The Series C market has evolved in parallel to the Series A market. Patterns haven’t changed. However, Series B data suggest insiders are leading aggressive rounds into compelling businesses. Witness the red line in this Series B Mean chart. Inside rounds have skyrocketed. Last year, inside rounds were  28% smaller than outside rounds. In 2020, they are 40% larger, a $33M swing in round size. We can argue the inside Series Bs have increased in size annually and are larger than outside rounds with very high confidence. The difference in means between inside and outside has a p-value of 0.095. And the annual change of inside Series Bs has a p-value of 0.009. Interestingly, the share of inside Series B rounds hasn’t changed. It has hovered around 22-23% for the past decade. What does this tell us? In 2020, Series A investors have changed their behavior at the Series B. We can see in the data Series A investors are pre-empting rounds at lofty valuations with massive checks. As I wrote in the previous post, this is happening because investors are adjusting to a virtual environment. Diligence completed almost entirely over video is new. If you trust a team, if you understand a company well, if you enjoy information asymmetry from a board seat, and if you’re less comfortable with remote diligence, pre-empting the Series B is very rational. Especially with so many early-stage funds raising opportunity funds and LPs seeking direct co-investments. Curiously, we don’t observe similar patterns in Series C rounds. It may be because there aren’t enough funds structured to lead the C after leading the B. Or it may be because the companies are more established, have more metrics to show, trade on multiples, and there’s more competition for them. It may be because founders seek variety in board composition and capital table ownership. Last, it may be that these rounds are happening but aren’t appearing in the data. I’m guessing here. Regardless, inside Series Bs have swelled after COVID. Founders benefit from faster investment processes, larger rounds, and the same friendly face mooning at them over Zoom. Data source: Crunchbase ; a big thanks to the team there for helping me compile this analysis.

Yesterday, Dremio hosted the Subsurface Conference , the first conference on cloud data lakes. More than 5000 people registered, and more than 2500 attended. If one had doubts that cloud data lakes are a strategic area for many in the data ecosystem, those figures should quash them. I delivered a presentation at the end of the day that I’ll share here. Entitled 5 Data Trends You Should Know, the presentation covers the major trends we observe in the data world. Here’s a quick narrative of the talk. 5 Major Trends in Data You Should Know from Tomasz Tunguz There is a mega-trend underpinning the changes in data design philosophy and tooling: the rise of the data engineer. Data engineers are the people who move, shape, and transform data from the source to the tools that extract insight. We believe data engineers are the change agents in a decade-long process that will revolutionize data. Data systems used to be purchased by IT. But in the last 20 years, individual departments started to purchase their own data systems. Each team, using their data systems, develops their proprietary data products: analyses, dashboards, machine learning systems, even new product features. Data systems rely on data from other teams. So all of these teams share data. And just like that, the company has built a data mesh: a network of producers and consumers of data who share data via standard APIs or open-source formats like Apache Arrow & Parquet. When the data is stored in the cloud, we call it a cloud data lake. Data engineers stand on the shoulders of 70 years of software development experience and take many of the learnings from that discipline. One example is developing a data engineering lifecycle. This is our current understanding of a typical data engineering software development lifecycle. There are six steps: Ingesting data from the systems that produce it and writing it into open formats in the cloud Planning the software to build Querying data using a compute engine which runs across the cloud data lake Modeling the data to ensure there is one centralized definition of every metric with an owner, a lineage, and a status Developing the data product which could be analyses, BI reports, machine learning models, production features Monitoring and testing the data to ensure data consistency & integrity over time As the profession of data engineering matures, engineers need new tools to help them with each step in the process. The five trends that we are observing within the data world are the rise of those tools at each step. Here are those 5: New data pipelines that use modern computer languages to create reusable abstractions for data processing, to monitor data pipelines, and to visualize the flow of data, the DAG (directed acyclic graph). Innovators here are Dagster, Airflow, and Prefect. Compute engines query data in the cloud without having to move it. They leverage the separation of data and compute to accelerate queries, enable secure and compliant access, .and future proof the infrastructure to new advances in tools and use cases which you haven’t been built. Innovators are Dremio and Databricks. Data modeling curates a data catalog for all the metrics within a company. When metrics are modeled, they are defined once, accurately, and everyone uses that definition. Innovators are Transform Data and Looker (with LookML). Data products are analyses, experiments, reports, and machine learning models/products built on data. Innovators in this category include Preset, Streamlit, and Tecton among others. Data quality tools monitor data streams, identify anomalies, create testing harnesses to ensure data is always accurate. Data quality innovators include MonteCarlo, SodaData, Great Expectations, and Data Gravity. All the tools need to be synthesized to achieve the vision of a modern data match, and data engineers will pioneer that change.

Marketing has many disciplines. Bill Macaitis counts nine . Gabe Larsen enumerates more . Howeve you may count and divide marketing skills, marketing is the team with the broadest mandate of different techniques to master. To handle this complexity, some startups have split the role under two leaders: a head of product marketing and a head of demand generation. This organizational pattern isn’t an anomaly. I searched on LinkedIn for VP Demand Generation . 464k results. An identical query for VP Product Marketing yields 1.6m profiles. LinkedIn cannot find companies with both titles, but let’s suppose the overlap is between 10-15%. Though still not a dominant structure, 10% bicephalous (two-headed) marketing teams aren’t rare. A longitudinal analysis would be insightful to understand how this structure’s popularity evolved with time. But I see this company structure more frequently across SaaS startups. This makes sense. In interviewing great CMOs , the product marketing leader is the first marketer most startups should recruit, and often the first key mishire . Product marketing is the vital work of developing a customer lifecycle journey, pricing, sales support materials, analyst relations, and press. Demand generation consumes the outputs from product marketing and injects them into marketing machinery that delivers content to prospects at scale consistently. Even the best retained search recruiters will be challenged to find one person to generate demand efficiently and develop a world-class customer lifecycle. By hiring two focused people, the startup is free to find the best person in each role. And the decision increases the likelihood of finding the ideal candidates sooner. Naturally, the improved effectiveness of the duo must outweigh the marginal cost of an additional team leader. But you only need to believe in the benefits of labor specialization to make that leap of faith. On the topic of challenges, there’s also convincing an aspiring marketing leader to accept a smaller team size and mandate, in exchange for a higher likelihood of success. And the CEO must accept one more direct report, with the management complexity that entails. Startups with this structure often grow large without needing additional management. Eventually, the startup may hire a CMO to manage the marketing team. As our recent GTM survey found , many companies hire chief marketing officers circa $20M-50M in annual recurring revenue, and CMOs lead the marketing teams at the majority of $100M ARR companies. If you’re thinking about your marketing team’s structure, the dual lead approach is one to consider.

In this era, virtual events have replaced IRL events.  Virtual events have many obvious benefits. No hotels, no event venues, no catering, no ensuring guests are in the right city at the right time. But there are unanticipated benefits that are only now coming to light. Many of our portfolio companies have experimented with virtual events quite successfully. We have done the same with our Office Hours program. These are some of the things that we have observed running vevents (may I coin a new word for them?). First, the number of attendees increases by a factor of 5-10x. Vevents amplify both registrants and attendees by similar multiples. An IRL event of 50, when transitioned online, will swell to 250-500 registrants. Curiously enough, the falloff rate between registration and attendance mirrors in-person events. I wonder what that says about human behavior. Second, because vevents liberate attendees and organizers from logistics, they can be executed on short notice. Provoked by the right content, audiences will register for an event two or three weeks out. With shorter cycle times between events, marketing teams can accelerate their cadence, learn quicker, and engage more of their ecosystem: a virtuous virtual cycle. Third, these vevents have filled the lead generation void left by the absence of IRL events, and then some. For marketing teams, this is a new muscle to flex, but the immediate impact to lead generation has evinced many marketers vevents are the future.  If you’re a bit behind your lead generation number with 5 weeks to go in the quarter, you have time to spin up 2 vevents to overachieve the target. Fourth, vevent platforms capture more granular data about the behavior of attendees than IRL events. Which vendors did attendees visit? How long did they tarry? Which talks did each person attend? Because platforms log these activities, marketers can learn from every interaction at an event, something completely impossible IRL. Gone are the days of the two-dimensional barcode scanner and the clever tchotchke as bait. There are privacy implications, which is something industry must evolve to tackle. But, the novel data from vevents empowers marketers to serve customers better. Of course, virtual events have trade-offs. There are fewer coincidental meetings, less Brownian motion serendipity. Sales conversions, ere account executives pressed flesh with customers, have been replaced by gladhanding over video. And, if you’re a presenter, it’s impossible to read the room. Don’t try a joke. The audience is silent and merciless, concealed behind your monitor somewhere in the ether. And the primary question to ask, whose answer is still unclear, will virtual event attendees buy software at anywhere close to the typical IRL rates? I’m curious to see the funnel evolve over the next few quarters. After attending and hosting virtual events, it’s clear to me they will continue to be an addition to the marketer’s quiver. And if you haven’t yet explored them at your startup, I think you should reconsider.

I’ve been searching for a book that combined the history, the people, and the emotional roller coaster of US economics. Given all that’s happening, I wondered how events today compare to other times in US history. I’ve spoken to people who lived through stagflation when interest rates were 15%. In history classes at school, I read about the Great Depression and the Roaring 20s. But I still sought the feeling of living it day-to-day. I read Galbraith’s The Great Crash of 1929 and it’s good, but focuses only on a single event. A History of the United States in Five Crashes is the best I’ve found. The book recounts five crashes: 1907, 1929, 1987, 2000, and 2010. So it doesn’t cover all US stock market crashes. But, the storytelling engrosses you, and you can imagine yourself reading the paper during those times, wondering how to invest. Exactly what I was looking for. The author argues that low-interest rates combined with a new financial product and a geopolitical event caused all five crashes. In 1929, investors piled into investment trusts, which were lightly regulated and highly speculative. Also, the Federal Reserve chairman was good friends with the chairman of the Bank of England. The UK sought more gold deposits to return to a gold-backed currency and asked the rest of the world to lower their interest rates. The US Fed complied for ten years (!), and a bubble ensued. I also didn’t realize how volatile markets were in that era. The Dow had gained 48.2 percent in 1928 and a combined 90.8 percent during 1927 and 1928, still the second-best two-year run the Dow has ever had, trailing only the 95.9 percent gain made during the two years ending in 1905. The book captures the quotidian sensation of reading the ticker. The stock market vacillations are written as a play-by-play, like a football match. Technology companies of the era  - the radio companies and the utility companies - traded at stratospheric multiples and endured nausea-inducing swings in their daily share prices ( SaaS ). Plus, the cast of players are spirited characters. It’s 1901. Teddy Roosevelt, shunted into the Vice Presidency by powerful politicians who wanted him out as governor of New York state, is sworn in as President after an anarchist assassinates President McKinley. Almost immediately, TR declares war against the monopolistic companies of the day ( Facebook, Google, Amazon ) and catalyzes a bear market. While the market is plummeting, TR can be found hunting bear deep in the American bush. In this era before the Federal Reserve, the banks step in to shore up the market. JP Morgan, a colossus of the epoch, backstops loans and shores up equities to curb the plunge. And it was the foot traffic of other key bankers to Morgan’s office on Wall Street that journalists write about that imbues confidence in the market. And that’s just the the first crisis. There are all sorts of chestnuts nestled in the book. The stock market used to be open on Saturdays for half-days. There’s an aside about the origin of General Motors and the allure of car stocks ( Tesla ). And how each era has its investment fad: chain banking, junk bonds, investment trusts, ( passive investing ). The allure of historical economics, and perhaps the siren’s call, is the desire to see patterns from the past and apply them today. There are parallels to find between the modern era and today in this book. But, better is to see how they rhyme. You can see where I found rhymes in italics in this post. If you’ve come across other similar books, please send them to me. I’d love to read them.

There’s a relatively new theory of how the government should manage the economy called Modern Monetary Theory . Over the weekend, I read a bit about it. With the impact of the COVID crisis, there are open questions about the best way forward. Should we continue managing the economy as we have since 1940 or change it? The US government has two primary economic goals: maximize employment and minimize inflation. The more employed Americans, the greater the GDP, the wealthier the country. Too much inflation means your money’s purchasing power decreases with time, which means you need more dollars to buy the same thing. In the past 80 or so years, the government has used the Kenyesian economic policy. There are two big ideas from this mental model you’ll recognize. First, the government should use interest rates to influence the economy. When the economy is doing well, increase interest rates to slow lending, and cut rates to stimulate the economy. Second, the government should fund itself from taxes. Keep the deficit in check by not spending too much. If the government prints money to fund expenses, inflation will balloon. The MMT has the same goals but achieves them differently. First, rather than influencing the economy through interest rates, change taxes dynamically. When the economy is doing well, tax more. During recessions, tax less. Second, the government guarantees everyone a job. That ensures the maximum employment rate. Empower the Executive Branch of the government to decide the projects these employees should pursue. Third, finance these jobs by making new money: grow the deficit. Fourth, tax the wealthy to pay for some of the difference, but maintain a significant deficit. MMT argues the deficit is the way governments create wealth for its citizens. These are complex issues and will be debated for many years to come. There are proponents of MMT and opponents. Stephanie Kelton has written a book on the MMT, which I read and it offers an in-depth explanation of the theory.  On the other side, many classical economists have critiqued the theory. The most colorful critique is from Paul Krugman who calls MMT “Calvinball” a game from the comic Calvin & Hobbes in which you can change the rules as you go. If you’d like to read more on the topic here are some places to start. If you like being an armchair economist as I do, it’s a fun rabbithole to explore. The Deficit Myth : Stephanie Kelton, an MMT proponent, lays out the argument in great detail.

Cloud Data Lakes are a trend we’ve been excited about for a long time at Redpoint. This modern architecture for data analysis, operational metrics, and machine learning enables companies to process data in new ways. A cloud data lake is a repository of data in native cloud storage, with the tools and infrastructure to analyze it securely, and with as little data movement as possible. We’re all storing data at increasing rates because every team inside a company needs data to succeed. The cloud data lake architecture enables companies to achieve scale, flexibility, and accessibility. A vital part of a cloud data lake is the open format of data. Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon wrote about how Amazon uses cloud data lakes to operate their business .  Quoting from that post: “With a data lake, data is stored in an open format, which makes it easier to work with different analytic services. Open format also makes it more likely for the data to be compatible with tools that don’t even exist yet. Various roles in your organization, like data scientists, data engineers, application developers, and business analysts, can access data with their choice of analytic tools and frameworks. You’re not locked in to a small set of tools, and a broader group of people can make sense of the data.” On July 30th, Dremio will be hosting the industry’s first Cloud Data Lake Conference called Subsurface . The conference features talks from practitioners and open-source leaders from the ecosystem from Netflix, Microsoft, Expedia, AWS, and Preset. I’ll also be speaking, sharing some of the trends we see in this space. If you’re curious about cloud data lakes and the technologies powering them and would like to learn from the leaders in the space, come to Subsurface .

It’s been two quarters since the coronavirus has hit Startupland. And you can see the impact of the shutdown in the numbers. We reviewed the data in May and compared it to the effects of the financial crisis in 2008 on startup fundraising. As a reminder, 2008 saw a 40% reduction in venture dollars invested in startups. It took about six to eight quarters to return to normalcy. But the patterns this time are different. The Seed, Series B, and Series C markets are down 37%, 23%, and 29%, respectively. These corrections match 2008. On the other hand, the Series A market is up about 10% from the trailing 2 year period previous high. Median round sizes have skyrocketed across all stages. Seed has more than doubled. Series As have increased by 25%. Series Bs are up 43%, and Series Cs are up by a quarter. To make the math work, the total number of rounds have to fall, and how they have fallen. Seed rounds are down from 1400 to about 400. Series As have fallen 30% and the others similarly. There’s a massive concentration of capital happening in companies that are doing well and those that are well known. This focus is particularly true at the later stages. We’ve met companies that have grown at steady and even accelerating rates through the crisis, especially those that capitalize on the dominant trends, including cloud computing, remote work, and collaboration. At the early stages, the phenomena are a bit different. There is a flight to the known. If a seed-stage company is doing well, time to lead the series A from the inside. The same is true for a promising Series A company: preemptive Series B from existing investors is around the corner. Easier to invest in a successful company that you know well than to find a company that is harder to diligence over video. Of course, that doesn’t characterize the entire industry. Many investors, including Redpoint, have led investments in companies we’ve never met “in-person.” This is very likely a sign of the future and an essential skill for both sides. The analysis I would like to run would show the relative round sizes of inside rounds compared to rounds led by new investors. I’ll be working on figuring that out for next time. I suspect inside rounds would likely be larger on average than outside rounds. The fundraising market is contracting. The amount of available dollars to invest is high. We venture capitalists have raised record amounts of capital in the last 2-3 years. But the pace of deployment is slowing. Data source: Crunchbase

On Wednesday, July 15th at 10 AM PT, Redpoint Office Hours will welcome Adam FitzGerald, the VP of Developer Relations at HashiCorp. Prior to HashiCorp Adam was the Head of Worldwide Developer Marketing at AWS and held senior positions at Pivotal, VMware, and SpringSource. With two decades of experience, Adam is well-versed in developer evangelism. My partner Astasia Myers will be leading the discussion. She writes often on topics like these on our blog Memory Leak . During the conversation, we’ll talk about how to build and scale developer advocacy teams, develop the right portfolio of evangelism approaches at every stage of the business, and measure their success. We’ll also answer questions from the audience. This office hours will be a virtual event. Since we may not have capacity constraints, we’ll try to accept all who sign up. We will collect questions from participants beforehand and ask them during the session. If you’re interested in attending, please apply here before Wednesday, July 8th. If you’re accepted, you will receive a registration email confirmation on July 9th. We look forward to welcoming Adam and all of our audience, and look forward to a great conversation. We’re starting to expand the scope of Office Hours, so look for more from us in the future.

Lately, I’ve been reading a lot about the stock market, the economy, and geopolitics, always a dangerous combination. I’ve come across two charts that I have been wondering about. The first comes from Bloomberg via the BEA . It shows consumer savings rates have catapulted to the highest level ever measured. Meanwhile, consumer spending has fallen in parallel. Consumer spending in the US accounts for 68% of GDP The question is then: how do consumers change their spending habits over the next quarter? Do they revert to the old patterns of purchasing? Shift to new categories? New brands? New geographies, lifestyles? Different savings patterns? The data suggests there is a discontinuity in consumer spending. Discontinuity means opportunity, especially for startups. The second is the concentration in the stock market. The five largest stocks account for 20% of the total value of the S&P500. This is from Goldman via Business Insider . Technology companies are benefitting from COVID. The pandemic is accelerating the rate of cloud computing and remote working. More time with computers drives server usage and entices users to dispense dollars on software and hardware. How many of us have upgraded our home offices? New keyboard, Bluetooth mouse, new monitor, better note-taking software? If growth in those names wanes, then the prospects for the public markets aren’t as rosy as the last few weeks have been. On the other hand, if the behemoths benefit and capture greater share, the index may continue to rise. How consumer spending evolves and the prospects for the largest technology companies are two of the more important trends in the next few quarters.  These are some of the charts I’ll be paying attention to.

Yesterday, we shared the Top 10 Learnings from the 2020 Redpoint GTM Survey at SaaS Office Hours. The presentation is embedded below. It contains data on go to market team structure, performance by sales function, marketing spend benchmarks, and customer success priorities. I want to thank Nick Giometti who parsed and processed the data and taught me (an R user) a lot about python and pandas along the way. Thanks to his work, we have some terrific insights to share. I also want to thank everyone contributed data. The full transcript is here. We received more than 500 responses to the survey, and as you will see the demographics, the respondents represent a broad swath of company sizes focused on different buyers. The deck in embedded above and is also linked here We’ve endeavored to include as much data as possible to help companies benchmark themselves relative to others. One note that we made in the office hours is that there does seem to be a positive skew to the respondent set. In other words, we hypothesize companies with favorable metrics responded in greater numbers. We use XDR to mean both SDR and BDR. The top 10 learnings from the survey are below. 1:1 AE/XDR ratios are the most common in both inside and outside sales teams. XDR teams are measured typically either on meeting count or pipeline value. 60% of teams employ meeting count, but goal selection doesn’t impact performance. Just pick a metric. If XDR teams hit their numbers, so do AEs. When XDR teams attain 95%+ of their target number, 50% of AE teams achieve 95%+. Sales teams with spans of control under 7 attain 80-95% of quota twice as frequently. Sales teams with spans of control greater than 7 whiff their quota (attainment of 50% or less) with twice as much frequency. Most sales teams ramp AEs (both inside and outside) on six month time periods. But, it’s important to consider sales cycle when setting ramp time. Marketing teams spend 5-10% of ARR on programs (non-headcount expenses),  and this is pretty consistent across ARR. 33% of respondents reported payback periods, burdened for gross margin, between 10-13 months. This was surprisingly low. Net dollar retention is the most common customer success goal, used by about 37% of respondents. Logo retention is second at about 33%. NPS is the least common at 7%. 40% of companies reported an NPS of > 50. This distribution was a surprise, and it reinforces the idea that customer success should not use NPS, since it doesn’t seem to be that discerning of a metric. Engineering:Account Executive headcount ratios scale from about 3:1 down to 1:1 as a company scales revenue. If you have any questions about the survey, please let me know on Twitter. We will do our best to respond to the questions. Thank you again, Nick, and everyone else who helped us along the way with the survey.

This post is part of a series leading up to SaaS Office GTM Edition on June 24 in which we’re reviewing the results of the 2020 Redpoint GTM survey. Today, we’re answering the question: how do teams grow as a startup scales? We can derive the table above if we look over the entire respondent base and bucket headcount by ARR. The median startup with between 1-5M in ARR will have 12 engineers, 6 in sales and 3 in marketing. As the company grows and reaches 50-100M in ARR, the ratio of engineers to salespeople asymptotes to 1:1, down from 2:1. Meanwhile, the size of the marketing team increases only by 4X, compared to a 10X increase in sales and a 5X+ in engineering. Software companies invest in engineering early and then the product matures, complement that engineering and product investment with go to market teams to commercialize the product. Another question we asked in the survey is the most senior title leading the customer success, sales and marketing teams. In the earliest days, leads head all of these teams. These are often individual contributors or team leads of small people. As a company skills to between 1-5M in ARR, the typical company hires their first VP in Sales. Reaching the 5-20M in ARR, the management team fills out with a layer of VPS. The VP titles remain in customer success in marketing. The Chief Customer Officer, the c-level title for customer success, is the rarest of the C-level titles appearing in less than 10% of companies at $20M in ARR or higher. But in sales, a CRO is often hired at the $20-50M ARR range. And at that scale or higher, CROs lead the go-to-market for more than 50% of respondents. CMOs in SaaS companies head 35% of companies in the $20-50M ARR range, 40% at $50-100M and 53% at $100M+. As we learned at office hours with Hollie Wegman, the role of the CMO is team builder. And marketing teams don’t scale linearly with other departments, so the need for a team builder can wait longer than either sales or customer success. These medians conceal a fair amount of variance due to the ACV, buyer, and other differences.  But if you were curious about what to expect at each stage of revenue growth, the data illustrates common patterns.

This post is part of a series leading up to SaaS Office GTM Edition on June 24 in which we’re reviewing the results of the 2020 Redpoint GTM survey. Today, we’re answering the question: how should you structure your sales teams for maximum performance? First, let’s introduce a concept called span of control . A span of control of 7 means, on average, each manager has seven people reporting to her.  I’ve seen teams with spans of control ranging from 1 to more than 40. Different departments operate with different averages, but the limiting factor tends to be the number of people a manager can coach successfully. Across the respondent base of 507 people, the average span of control (Soc) is 4.7, with a skew toward smaller teams. The most common SoC is 3. If we look at AE quota attainment by SoC, some interesting patterns emerge. Let’s take a look at the top-left chart. Here’s how to read it. For teams with SoC <=7, 18% achieved less than 50% of quota. 34% achieved of teams with spans of control > 7 whiffed their number. Squads with SoC > 7 attain at less than 50% of quota twice as frequently. If we take the bottom left chart, we see that it’s twice as common to see AE teams attain 80-95% of quota if the SoC <=7. Smaller, tighter crews are more likely to outperform. There’s no way to prove causation, however.  There are other contributing factors. Hypergrowth companies may hire a bunch of managers to scale teams. During the hyper-growth phase, the SoCs may be small because there are many managers and fewer AEs. AE experience matters, too. More senior sales teams need less coaching, so it would be interesting to cut this data by AE seniority. Last, the expertise and skill of the manager matter a great deal. The data suggests that smaller teams are likelier to perform better, and adds another data set supporting a SoC of 7 or less.

Leading up to the SaaS Office Hours GTM Edition, every day until then, we are reviewing key insights from the Redpoint GTM survey. Yesterday’s post revealed the most common metric for measuring SDRs and BDRs, and the impact on AE quota attainment. If you’d like to attend the office hours session on these analyses, please register by June 19 here Today, we’ll review the impact of XDR (either sales development rep or business development rep) attainment on AE quota attainment. This analysis looks at both inside and outside sales AE attainment. The short answer is that they are highly correlated. When XDR teams attain 95%+ of quota, 80% of AE teams attain theirs.  When XDR teams attain 80-95% of quota, 75% of AE teams hit plan. Conversely, if XDR teams achieve less than 50% of their goal, only 33% of AE teams perform to target. This result is true independent of buyer type (product, engineer, legal, finance, IT, etc.), ACV, ARR, or any other demographic variable we collected in the survey. In retrospect, I wish we had asked: what fraction of leads do XDRs generate for your business? It may have shown a difference in companies that rely on XDR support vs. other channels. This correlation suggests XDR performance is a reliable leading indicator for ultimate quota attainment. Anyone who has managed a sales team will say it’s an obvious conclusion. But it’s always wonderful to see these bits of integration confirmed across such a large sample set. The performance of the XDR team presages the success of the AE team.

On June 24 at 10am Pacific, SaaS Office Hours will hosting be a virtual session. This time, we will be reviewing some of the insights from Redpoint’s 2020 Go To Market Survey . Nick Giometti and I have been working to prepare the survey results over many weeks. Last week, we published highlights at Saastock. If you’d like to register to attend and submit questions, please fill out the registration here by June 19 . Each day until June 24, we will be writing in-depth posts on some of key topics. During the office hours session, we’ll answer questions and review additional analyses requested by the audience ahead of time. To kick things off today, we’re going to talk about SDR and BDR goals. We surveyed about 500 sales teams to understand which is the most popular metric for XDR teams (either SDR, sales development rep, or BDR, business development rep). Also, we wanted to understand the impact on AE attainment. In other words, do AE teams perform better when SDR teams use one metric over another? The data shows about 60% of XDR teams prefer meeting count to pipeline value. Each of these metrics has their trade-offs. Meeting count is tangible and knowable immediately, but no AE wants a calendar stuffed full of low ACV deals. They won’t hit quota. Pipeline value is better aligned with the AE, since they want to understand which meetings are the most valuable, but it’s often challenging for an XDR to estimate this accurately. Does this slight preference for meeting count impact AE quota attainment? The chart above reveals the answer. The chart shows AE quota attainment broken down by SDR goal metric. You’ll notice the distribution of the data is the same. Here’s how to read the chart. Let’s take the left side. For XDRs goaled on meeting count, 33% of AE teams achieve 80-95% of their quota. AEs supported XDR teams measured by Pipeline Value perform similarly. In short, the top-level XDR metric does not correlate with ultimate AE performance. So, pick either metric and move onto the next strategic question. Look out for more posts like this until June 24, and if you have questions or would like to learn more, please register and ask your questions.

Written materials transform board meetings. With most of us working remotely, many startups have thrown out Google slides and replaced them with Google docs. It’s a fundamental change, and one I hope persists after work returns to the new normal. Amazon is famous for its narrative process and contempt of slides. The email in which Bezos banishes decks reads: “The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than ‘writing’ a 20 page PowerPoint is because the narrative structure of good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what how things are related. Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas.” Reading about this methodology is one thing. Living it is quite another. Once you experience it, you never go back. Many of the companies I work with have moved to this format and it’s a radical advance. Board meetings with written materials are better. They are shorter, more focused, more effective. There is no briefing section. No one reads slides aloud. There is no guessing what’s interesting to talk about because most of these meetings start with questions. If you have read the materials, you know what is important. So the conversation naturally focuses on the 2-3 most salient topics facing the company. Conversation is doubly important on video. When presenting, you can’t read the room and ensure that attendees are focused on the conversation. Starting with discussion engages most attendees immediately. Also, the startup’s team benefits from less time spent preparing because they expend no time on slide formatting. Once you start writing, you realize how much time slide decks consume on font size, icon alignment, and formatting detail. So how do you do this? Each team leader writes their own section, no more than 1-2 pages summarizing the state of the business. Introduction, things going well, challenges, plans for the future, update on items from last time. These sections can contain graphs and charts. The CEO summarizes and provides a narrative at the beginning of the document. The VP Finance attaches the financial statements and key reports. The team circulates the narrative with the board ahead of time. Board members comment and ask questions as they read. The team clarifies points and provides analysis where necessary. At first, the process may feel awkward. Many people don’t write in business. But after one or two meetings, the team finds its groove, it’s hard to look back. I’m convinced written materials produce superior board meetings. Teams expend less effort preparing, the meeting focuses on the strategic questions, and the meetings are shorter and effective.

Recently, we welcomed Hollie Wegman to SaaS Office Hours to talk about marketing to developers. It was our first virtual event, and we had hundreds of people attend. Given the success of the format, we are going to continue it. During our chat, Hollie shared some valuable wisdom from her experience as a marketing leader at Segment, Envoy, Mulesoft, and Salesforce. Here are some of the highlights from the session. The full transcript is here A recruiter in the audience submitted a question often discussed in startup boardrooms. The CEO wants to hire someone with demand generation experience. The head of product would prefer someone with product marketing experience. What’s your advice when hiring a CMO? When you think about how to hire a really good CMO, you’re actually thinking about how to hire somebody that’s gonna do that. Not somebody that’s going to come in and fix a pillar level problem. And when I say pillar, I mean like a product marketing problem, a growth problem, or brand marketing problem. They may fix those problems, but they’re maybe going to do that through hiring. If you’re hiring a sales leader, you don’t pass up an awesome sales leader that has a killer track record of closing deals just because in their previous company they sold success software, and then with your company, they’re going to sell MarTech. You know that they’re a great leader and that’s going to translate. You don’t pass up an engineering leader because he or she didn’t code in the language that your company codes in. A CMO is a company builder first. And so you hire for that. You hire for strategy. How do you know when a company has established product-market fit? Do the metrics suddenly change? Yeah, I think there’s a really strong tie between product market fit and inbound signal. If I’m not doing a lot to build the brand and I’m still getting inbound, then I’m like, wow, okay. We have some product market fit going here and you’re in happy days. I try to join companies that already have signaled product market fit because it makes my marketing job so much easier. I think there’s definitely a relationship between product market fit and inbound. I don’t know that there’s some kind of magic moment where just having product market fit is going to cause my efficiency to be great. I suppose there’s definitely a relationship. I think things do catch fire and then acquisition will get more affordable. Most developer focused companies use a two-prong go-to-market with potentially two very different marketing messages: one to the technical buyer and one to the business buyer. When you have one website, one marketing team, and one sales team, and you’ve got only one shot to talk about your product, how do you balance those two things? Yes, this is a genuine challenge and I’ve faced it in basically all of my companies. I have this concept that I talk about called “The Developer Duplex.” If you think about a duplex, the duplex is a house with two units and one roof. They share the same roof. It’s one building, but it is two separate units. In one unit, there’s a family with certain concerns, and in the other unit, there’s another family with different concerns. When you think about “The Developer Duplex,” one unit is the developer and the other unit is the business buyer. They have different concerns so you are going to have to bifurcate your message. You’re going to have to message to the developer a little bit differently than the way you’d message to the business user, but the roof is the same. So there is some level of high level messaging about what your company does and what your product does, which is the roof over the top. And then, don’t be afraid to have different conversations with the two different units. If you read through the transcript, you will see more detail on how to market to developers and technical audiences, an important topic for many startups’ go-to-markets. I learned an incredible amount from Hollie,  and feel very grateful that she joined us for an hour. Thank you, Hollie!

Earlier this week, I wrote Californian Dreaming - Is Silicon Valley Still the Best Place to Start a Company , where I analyzed the IPO and M&A trends of venture-backed companies by state. Those metrics are lagging indicators of startup distribution. How will the distribution change with time? While we can’t know the future M&A and IPO of any company in particular, we can try to divine the future by looking at current unicorn distributions. I pulled the unicorn valuation list and analyzed US startups by state. 63% of current unicorns, startup companies valued at $1B or more, are headquartered in California. 79% of unicorn market capitalization accrues to startups headquartered in California. (Unicorn market cap is the last known valuation of the companies). If recent history has taught us anything, it’s that valuations can change on a dime. Barring some sudden shift, these data suggest California’s share of significant exit events should at least sustain current levels; and an optimist could argue, further concentrate in California.

So much has happened in the last decade. We’ve seen the rise of massive startups in Europe, South America, China, Israel. Technology entrepreneurship is a global phenomenon. Within the US, there’s much talk of a diaspora out of California and Silicon Valley, particularly with the sudden move to remote work catalyzed by the coronavirus. Has the shine rubbed off the Golden State to reveal pyrite? Over the last ten years, California based startups consistently raise about 35% of the venture capital in the US by round count. In dollar terms, California’s share is a bit higher at 40%. That figure hasn’t changed despite the massive increases in total venture funding from about $10B to $100B in that time frame. However, California startups’ share of acquisitions has declined meaningfully from 30% to 19%. Acquirers have started to shop outside of California browsing wares in other states’ aisles. Not the states you might think of like New York or Massachusetts, but the other ones. This fragmentation is a natural by-product of labor market arbitrage and the dispersion of knowledge all over the world. It’s not all bad news for California. The Bear Flag Republic’s share of US startup IPOs has doubled in the last two years from 25% to more than 40%. That’s important because a few goliath startups dominate venture capital returns. Although more M&A occurs elsewhere, more of the largest companies in the US are built in California. And this persists for all the reasons that have made Silicon Valley special: the open networks, the universities, the culture, the concentration of capital. You might counter the startup IPO market is dead, long live the IPO market. And it indeed has contracted by about 30% per year since 2010, while M&A has tripled. The real litmus test is the number of billion-dollar M&A compared to IPOs, which today are almost always valued at $1B or more. Over the past decade, 102 M&A transactions have occurred for more than $1B.  With more than 150 IPOs in the slowest year and better than 3000 in the last decade, the IPO remains dominant in the quest for outsized returns. The California dream is alive and well.

On June 3rd at 10 am, SaaS Office Hours will welcome Hollie Wegman , former CMO at Segment . Hollie has a wealth of experience as a marketer. She’s marketed many iconic companies including Salesforce, Mulesoft, and Envoy. During our conversation, we’ll talk about how to market technical products to developers, how to scale marketing teams, and how to develop the right portfolio of marketing approaches at every stage of the business. We’ll also answer questions from the audience. These office hours will be the first virtual SaaS Office Hours, so we’ll be trying something new. Since we may not have capacity constraints, we’ll try to accept all who sign up. I’ll coalesce questions and ask them during the session. If you’re interested in attending, please register here . I’m very much looking forward to welcoming Hollie. I’m sure it will be great conversation.

Here are three little puzzles about infinity. Here’s a short blue line and a red line that is 3x longer than the blue line. Let me show you how there are just as many points in the blue line as there are in the red line. Let’s make a right triangle with the blue and red lines, and then draw a green line to connect them. I’ll draw a line connecting a point on the blue line to a point on the red line. I can draw an infinite number of lines from the blue line to the red line. Though the red line is three times longer than the blue line, they have an equal number of points. The same idea works with circles. I have here two concentric circles. The bigger one has 3x the diameter of the small one, but they both have the same number of points. If I draw a line or two from the center, I trace a path over a point in the red circle and a corresponding point in the blue circle. The blue circle’s circumference might be 3x longer, but it has the same number of points as the red circle. Here’s the last puzzle about infinity, but this time, I won’t give you the answer. Here’s a number line. This number line contains all the numbers from zero to infinity. There are an infinite number of numbers from zero to infinity. There are also an infinite number of numbers from 0 to 1 (e.g., 0.001, 0.000001, 0.0000000001, etc). Which infinity is bigger? Is the infinity between 0 to 1 bigger than the infinity between 0 and ∞? Or vice-versa? Or are they the same size? And what does it mean to compare the size of one infinity to another? I’ve always admired those who could grapple with pure math, the kind of math that doesn’t have a physical analog. I have a tough time of it. Pure math is about creating abstractions on top of abstractions. Very similar to computer programming, which has many, many layers of abstraction from assembly code to the networking protocols to the user interface. Every once in a while, I come across a great book about pure math. I found these puzzles in David Foster Wallace’s Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity . DFW simplifies some esoteric concepts about infinity and writes in a style that blends a deep understanding of math and philosophy with simplicity and humor. It’s hard to do, but a hugely successful effort. If you enjoy this kind of thing, it’s well worth a read.

If the shelter-in-place order were to remain in place for another 12 months, how would you change the way you run your business? Over the past two months, CEOs and founders have managed the turbulence imposed by the coronavirus onto their companies. Most of the time, we’ve implemented short-term plans. This week, the first companies announced longer-term plans. Twitter empowered employees to work from home forever . Google and Facebook announced work-from-home plans through the end of 2020 . I’m sure there will be more announcements of this ilk. Given all the uncertainty for the next few quarters in how we will work, and it may be time to shift from short-term decisions to longer-term planning, like these larger companies. If you knew that shelter-in-place would continue for another 12 months, what changes would you enact today as a business leader? Would you reconsider your real estate budget? A leader of a public company shared with me that her board encouraged her to embrace remote work, identify which roles could be successfully staffed mostly remotely, and cut real estate budgets by 25-30% next year and into the future. Would you hire a head of people sooner? Internal communications differ in remote work . Writing becomes more critical. Relationship building must take new forms. There are no conversations around the Bevi machine anymore (or caffeinated raspberry sparkling water). Without clear and reliable internal communications, a startup cannot move as a single unit and execute with speed - a startup’s core advantage. Also, someone must develop on-boarding and off-boarding processes for incoming and outgoing remote workers. Those may be new muscles for a company to flex. Would you change the way you recruit? Perhaps, you might embrace remote workers more than in the past? Or prefer candidates with remote work experience, particularly for managers? Would you define a new office layout? The open office plan may have seen its apogee in the last decade. Will employees request cubes again? Might you begin to plan how to return employees to the office building? Another friend who works in a New York high rise at a major investment bank told me elevators are the limiting factor in returning people to work. How do you move people into and out of a building safely when elevator capacity is reduced by 75%? What other strategic imperatives might change? Most of us have been making near-term decisions. It may be time to shift to longer-term for another 6-18+ months of business operations in this new normal.

Why is the S&P index “only” down about 15%? Given all the economic turmoil, shouldn’t the index collapse? I was wondering this so I went to the source of all truth on the internet, Reddit. As I read the investing subreddit , I stumbled onto an explanation written by VPride1995 using a simple mental model that illuminated one potential answer. The discount dividend model states that the value of a stock is the discounted cash flow of all future dividends. Companies pay a dividend to shareholders from profits. Public companies dividend out 30-40% of earnings on average. The model says that the value of a stock is equal to next year’s dividends divided by (the cost of capital minus the dividend growth rate). Written as an equation Value = (Dividend_this_year x (1+dividend_growth_rate)) / (risk_free_rate + equity_risk_premium - dividend_growth_rate) We can treat the S&P500 as one stock, even though it’s a basket of 500. We can plug in last year’s numbers in the table linked here to get an approximation for the value of the S&P 500 on Dec 31, 2019, of 3224, and this implies an S&P dividend growth rate of 5.8%. The S&P500 levels in April suggest that the market believes dividends will grow at 4.0%, down 30%. But a lot has happened since then. If we assume two years of zero dividends, then dividends resume at their 2019 levels in 2022, then the value of the S&P500 is modeled to be 2777, which is just about a 15% decline. So you could explain the 15% decline by saying: the market has priced in two years of no dividends. Alternatively and more pessimistically, if you assume the dividend growth rate falls from 5.8% to 4% after two years at zero dividends, then you should expect the index to fall 25% in value. Even in the extreme scenarios of no profits/dividends for two years and a 30% reduction in growth rate two years hence, the index should fall about 25%. Like all mental models, this one is a gross simplification. It doesn’t consider the equity value or the appreciation of the S&P 500 during that time. And in reality, the stock market is a far more complex beast. There are major forces shaping the markets: the rise of passive investing, variances in trading volumes (which increase volatility), and vacillating dollar investment flows entering and exiting the US stock markets. The DDM is not a unifying theory of economics, just a toy gyroscope to understand one principle. The model helped me understand why my intuition for stock market drops may not align well with how I ought to be thinking about them. Just because revenues fall or growth rates fall or profits fall a certain amount doesn’t mean the market should move in tandem with them.

In March, I published analysis of the fundraising market in 2008 . It showed that the later rounds, the series B and series C were the most impacted. The early data from March 2020 shows a different pattern. Seed and Series A rounds are first to bear the compression in the market. Later rounds are unblemished. Round volumes in seed have been declining since summer 2018. The same is true for Series A and Series B. Meanwhile, Series Cs are flat to up. Median round size reverted violently to two-year lows after a significant spike in Q4 2019. As, Bs, and Cs median round sizes remained level or grew. And overall in the market, seed and Series A dollars fell by about 15%. The later rounds moved in the opposite direction. What could be driving some of these trends? First, it’s quite early to be drawing conclusions. The data is noisy. Rounds consummated a few months ago are still being announced. Second, investors are learning how to diligence investments without human contact. Meeting a founder for the first time during a process is more typical in the early stages. By the time a company raises a Series B or C, they have established relationships with later-stage investors. So, virtual partner meetings and diligence calls benefit from the relationship foundation laid last year, which might explain the continued deal velocity. Third, investors continue to concentrate capital in a smaller number of companies. The coronavirus reinforces the flight to growth dynamics we observed last year. The fastest-growing companies continue to raise massive rounds. If a startup’s growth isn’t sensational, then it’s a much more challenging fundraising market. That’s why the median rounds are constant or flat. Fourth, the public markets have proved remarkably resilient and forward multiples for some companies like Zoom and Shopify exceeded all time highs. These comparables are used for valuing private companies. Like a locomotive, these public companies’ gains pull valuations of smaller companies along. By the time Q2 concludes, we’ll have a better sense for how the fundraising market rodeo is evolving. We’ll have 3 months of data, rather than just March in Q1.

Much has changed in the world since we announced our last early stage fund in 2018, especially in the last several months, as so much of our day-to-day lives have been reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic. We believe it’s more important than ever to back visionary founders, like the many we’ve had the privilege of working with as a firm so far. We’re both excited and grateful to have the opportunity to continue to partner with early stage entrepreneurs. To that end, we wanted to share that we’ve raised a new $500M early stage fund. Times of crisis often reveal the great leaders from the good. We are impressed by the many founders who understand this innately and continue to steer their businesses thoughtfully through this unexpected time. At Redpoint, we feel very fortunate to back people who are building the future. While the entire world looks to rise and rebuild, we have every confidence that the startup ecosystem too will continue to invent and thrive. Important businesses will emerge from this period motivated by the idea that they can support and improve the ways we work and live. We’re honored to be part of the journey with each of our entrepreneurs and portfolio companies, and are very grateful for the opportunity to work with the team here at Redpoint. We wish each and every one in our community resiliency and good health.

How do you benchmark a sales organization in a time like this? This is one of the questions that Jim Benton, CEO of Chorus.ai, answers every day in his Daily Briefings . Using data across 10m telephone calls, Jim highlights how the coronavirus is changing sales team performance. Here are some of the highlights from my reading. Cold calls are down 67% , while connect rates have fallen by about 10% since January . Discovery calls are down 24%. It’s curious that volumes have fallen, given the connect rates have seen such a modest decline. The risks to deals closing have evolved. Timeline risk, the likelihood a sale drags to a close, has doubled to about 2% of calls. But the more significant risk is employment risk. Conversations discussing layoffs have increased 2.5x to more than 5% of calls . An additional 2% mention hiring freezes. Customers are asking for longer payment terms . In early March, 75% of sales conversations discussed net 30. But as of early April, a roughly equal number of calls request longer than 30 day payment terms. In a conversation with Greg Holmes, the former CSO of Zoom, Jim discusses the 11% meeting volume drop in March, which has stabilized at those lower levels in April. Curiously, these volume changes are not uniform across the country. New York reported a 2.5% increase, while Utah saw a nearly 20% decline . If you’re interested in how to benchmark your sales team and understand how other sales teams’ performance is evolving, take a look at the Chorus Daily Briefing .

A few weeks ago, I wrote What I Expect in the Next Few Months in Startupland , in which I mentioned two fundamental forces: Bullwhip Effect and Startup Growth Rates. We are seeing the impact on both in full force today. A quick refresher on the Bullwhip Effect: “The idea is that small changes in retail demand amplify into big swings up the supply chain.” A few readers asked for examples. Today, it’s hard to dodge them. A barrel of oil cost -$7 last week. Electricity in France was better than free, hitting -€20 per megawatt hour. And coincidentally, beer brewers are suffering the effects of overproduction . These are examples of adverse demand shocks: demand disappearing for energy and liquid courage overnight. There have also been massive positive demand shocks. Netflix added twice as many subscribers , 16m, as it had projected this quarter. Zoom grew to 300m monthly active users , approaching an infinite growth rate. You can’t buy a puppy , a puzzle , or pork chop . This is the Bullwhip Effect in force. This dynamic affects startups just as much as the rest of the economy. More than 30k startup employees have lost their jobs . Layoffs arise from volatility. The less predictable a business becomes, the more conservative its management must be. Which raises the question for a CEO: how should a startup model growth from here?  If a company was growing at 10% monthly before February, will it continue to grow at 10%? If a company is benefiting from remote work trends, and the growth rate has tripled overnight, how long will that growth rate continue? If a company has seen a 25% downturn in new lead generation, is that a blip or the new normal? All of these questions are forms of the same deeper question: is the company’s base rate an accurate projection of future growth? In the public markets, investors are projecting consistent base rates for some software companies. Public software companies growing 30% or more annually have seen only a 6% decline in their valuation multiples. But, slower growers’ multiples have contracted 30-45%. Perhaps the fastest growing businesses will see less of an impact. Uncertain demand is the root of both of these phenomena. When will consumers spend again? How will software buyers’ preferences change? That’s the key question today.

If I start a salacious tweetstorm that our local bank is running out of money, that rumor will circulate quickly. Eventually, the rumor will trigger a bank run. By tomorrow, the bank will face insolvency, even though it was business as usual at the bank this morning. This is the idea behind Narrative Economics. Robert Shiller wrote Narrative Economics , in which he explores how stories impact the economy. In particular, narratives stoked three depressions and recessions in the US in 1920, 1929, and 2008. Shiller, a respected and lauded professor at Yale, models the spread of narratives in these periods using epidemiology. Positive narratives are just as mighty. Shiller also studies the Rubik’s cube and internet memes as examples of narratives that take on a life their own and influence the behavior of millions. If there’s reason to believe stories are powerful economic forces at the country level, there’s reason to believe stories are just as compelling for individual companies. We do see this behavior in Startupland. Some seed-stage companies pack their seed rounds with luminary angels in a field. One company recently courted many top VPs of Product in the valley. This cadre of product influencers reinforces the narrative that the “smartest product managers” use this product. Customer testimonials employ social proof to reinforce a vendor’s narrative. The better respected the customer testimonial, the more forceful the testimony. If you’ve ever worked for a major corporation and received press training, you know the importance of a narrative. You’ll have been trained to answer questions in a very particular way: each answer will tie back to the main storyline of the business. What is the narrative of your business? Here are some from our portfolio. Kustomer is the modern customer support platform built by veterans in the field. The founders have built three companies in the domain, sold their last one to Salesforce, and developed Kustomer with all the knowledge and insights from those experiences. Gremlin is the chaos engineering company. The founders developed chaos engineering and resiliency testing at Netflix and Amazon, which increased those services’ uptime from three nines to four nines. The customer story typically originates from two founts; either the founders or product marketing . Regardless, the message should be promulgated through every channel: sales, marketing, press, recruiting, events, etc. The more you can spread the narrative, the greater the potential force for your business. To what extent is impossible to know. As Shiller writes in his concluding paragraphs, “there are serious issues of inferring causality…these issues are not surmountable.” Even if we can’t measure it, or directly attribute causality,  the effect of stories and narrative economics  is real and powerful.

Among the most useful frameworks I’ve found to manage a company in this era is the 2×2 matrix above. This matrix answers the question: what should the company’s stance be. It also raises the question: when should it change? One could argue times like these all good opportunities to adopt a defensive posture: focus on product, limit GTM hiring, and modulate burn. A million saved is a million raised. On the other hand, one could argue, now is a great time to press competitive advantage, win share, and emerge from this epoch stronger for it. Fortune favors the bold. Both are equally viable strategies. So, which should yours be? Here’s one way to think about it. On the y-axis, you will find customer demand for the product, from tepid to ravenous. The x-axis explores the cash balance of the company from thin coffers to overflowing war chest. A thin balance sheet and tepid demand (bottom left). This is a hard place to be. The most important goal is to get to cash flow breakeven. A company in this position must prioritize survival and longevity. Thin balance sheet and ravenous demand (top left). Your customers’ desire outstrips your ability to supply your service. Ideally, the management team should raise more capital to move to the upper right quadrant of the matrix. Venture capital, debt, or negotiating better cash collections (multi-year prepay) are all viable strategies to position the business to press its advantage. Plenty of cash and tepid demand (bottom right). In this position, a business should focus on satisfying existing customers and invest in product advances. If customers don’t prioritize your product, scaling an expensive go to market force bolstered by significant marketing spend will likely be ineffective. Wait for your moment to come before seizing it. Plenty of cash and ravenous demand (top right). If you’re lucky enough to be in the top right, you’re in the best position. Full speed ahead. Double down the investment in go to market, light up customer acquisition channels with marketing, pursue strategic acquisitions. Everything is on the table. It’s time for all-out offense. When you have an advantage, speed up the game . Once the team establishes the company’s stance, they can determine the right financial plan for the rest of the year. Which quadrant is your company in today? And what does that imply about your plans for 2020? Strategic triggers are essential complements to a plan, especially those around burn. First, when should the company raise capital? If need be, when should the company explore cutting staff to reach cash-flow break even. Which metrics suggest it’s the right time to grow the GTM teams again? Does the company want to be more or less aggressive in anticipating a recovery? What is your strategic stance? And which are your trigger points to change it?

Sam Jacobs created the Revenue Collective , a group of more than 1700 sales professionals at some of the fastest-growing companies. With chapters across the US, Revenue Collective has broad reach within the sales community. I’ve known Sam a long time and he’s done remarkable work with this community. Recently, Revenue Collective surveyed its members about the impact of coronavirus on businesses. The data is insightful both as a tool for benchmarking your own company and also to understand the mentality of sales leaders in this challenging time. You can download the survey here. Here some of the highlights that I observed in my reading: 96% have seen some impact to their business. 72% of respondents have adjusted revenue targets and forecasts, or expect to soon.  Only about 1% have seen a benefit and are increasing their forecasts. 61% will see a decline in Q2 bookings relative to Q1. About 15% will see an increase. 62% have or will change quota in 2020. Typically, sales leaders have reduced quota somewhere between 10-50%. 80% of respondents have paused hiring, and a similar number have reduced their budget. Business travel, new hires, and new software purchases were the top categories of budget reductions. About 54% of respondents have seen higher churn; the other half has seen no change. A majority of revenue leaders believe the impact of COVID-19 will persist through 2020. These trends fall in line with what we are observing across our portfolio. Typically, go to market hiring is paused for most businesses. Founders and CEOs are evaluating their options to lengthen runway and increase margin . One of the key challenges is determining how to manage quotas for the rest of the year given the turbulence in lead generation, sales cycles, and priorities. If you are a revenue leader or a CEO, these metrics may help you get a better grasp on what happening in the market and what changes you might make to your business.

Over the last decade, growth has been the winning card for startups to play. The faster the business grew, the higher its valuation. Margins didn’t matter much. Neither gross margin, nor net income margin weighed heavily on a company’s valuation unless they deviated grossly from norms. Today, runway ranks as the first consideration in evaluating a company’s strategy. Suddenly, margins matter. Richer margins lengthen runway. Let’s illustrate the point with a hypothetical startup at $1M in monthly revenue. Assume the company grows 5% per month. The company generates a gross profit of 60%. The gross profit is the revenue minus the COGs (cost of goods sold). For most software companies, COGs encompasses cloud hosting costs and some fraction of customer success and professional services salaries. The company burns $1.9M per month in operating expense. Operating expense, or OpEx, includes the salaries the remaining employees plus marketing and selling costs, travel, food, real estate, and other expenses. Month 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Year Revenue 1.0 1.1 1.1 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.7 15.9 Gross Profit 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.9 0.9 1.0 1.0 9.6 Opex 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 22.2 Net Income -1.3 -1.2 -1.2 -1.2 -1.1 -1.1 -1.0 -1.0 -1.0 -0.9 -0.9 -0.8 -12.6 The profit and loss statement of the company shows revenue increasing from $1M in monthly revenue to $1.7M. The startup produces $15.9M in revenue, spends $22M in OpEx, and generates a loss of $12.6M for the year. 60% gross margin leaves room for improvement. What if the company could improve it? How many more months of burn could the company yield with this alchemy? Note: I’m assuming net income and cash burn are the same here for simplicity. Gross Margin Net Income Incremental Months of Burn 60% -12.6 - 65% -11.9 1.0 70% -11.1 2.0 75% -10.3 3.0 80% -9.5 4.0 85% -8.7 5.0 Here’s the sensitivity table. Varying the gross margin yields net income for each scenario. Each five percentage points of gross margin squeeze one incremental month of burn from the spreadsheet. In this case, gross margin improvements lengthen runway meaningfully. For startups, there tend to be two significant drivers of gross margin: cloud computing costs and professional services. Reining in the costs for one or both of these may have a material impact on a startup’s runway. In addition,  contribution margin is another important figure to analyze. The contribution margin is the cost to acquire a marginal customer, so improvements to the contribution margin reduce the sales and marketing component of the OpEx line. It’s harder for companies to improve the contribution margin of customer acquisition as readily as reducing the COGs, but still worth the effort to examine the impact. If your startup has less than 24 months’ runway, you may want to explore the impact of improving gross margin by 5-10%. You may find an extra few months of runway hidden withinin the hinges of your engineers’ Aeron chairs.

When will a start up’s management team feel comfortable telling employees there safe to return to work? Is it when the government declares it safe? Or schools re-open? Or customer prospects agree to meet in person? Or when we each record a positive antibody test? How will we conduct meetings? With masks and gloves?  What will be the social norms to say hello? Handshakes, hugs, high-fives, waves, hand over your heart, a bow? Will it be impolite to shake hands and immediately use alcohol to disinfect your hands? Will it be impolite to ask if someone has been tested for coronavirus? Will we carry immunity passports ? How will it feel to return to work in an office? Will we sit as close to our colleagues as we did in January? Will we come into the office less when we feel a cold coming on?  Will we all look at the person coughing in the corner and suspect them of harboring something? Will we start bringing our own lunches to work? When we all travel the way we used to, boarding planes to attend a last minute meeting across the country? What fraction of meetings that used to be in person will be conducted by video? As the tone of the conversation shifts from a focus on quarantine to re-emerging in the world, these are some of the questions I’ve been wondering about. Let me know if you have a perspective on Twitter .

Which startup sectors are most affected by coronavirus? Roger Lee is maintaining Layoffs.fyi , which is a table of all the startups who have unfortunately cut staff. On the brighter side, it is a resource for startups looking to hire as they grow. Over the weekend, I analyzed Roger’s data to answer this question. First, let’s look at layoffs by day. Before March 23, there wasn’t a meaningful volume. But starting that week, startups began reducing headcount by about 700 per day.  On March 23, many states and countries started implementing lockdowns. Friday spike to more than 1800. The following week saw similar patterns with the most volume on Thursday and Friday. However, there doesn’t yet seem to be a daily or weekly increase in the data. If we tally the reductions by category, travel, retail, fitness, real estate, transportation, and recruiting constitute the top 6 categories. Aside from recruiting, these are all consumer discretionary spend categories. ClassPass, one of the fitness startups to reduce headcount, reported a 95% drop in sales in 10 days.  The lockdowns have reduced foot traffic by 50% or more . Software startups sold to human resources, security, legal, IT, and product teams are at the bottom of the list. Because sales cycles in software are slower, we should expect a higher latency before seeing reductions in force in those categories. In consumer discretionary categories, changes in spending appear immediately at the till. Startups facing difficult choices should research the PPP (Paycheck Protection Program) to determine if they are eligible for forgivable government debt to help them manage through these turbulent times. Programs like the PPP should help minimize layoffs and keep small to medium businesses running.

With all the breaking news every hour, I found myself looking for a longer-term perspective on the world. I read a book that fit the bill: Peter Zeihan’s Disunited Nations is a political economy book, a sort of Guns, Germs, and Steel for the future. I wish my economics classes had been taught in Zeihan’s style. Zeihan structures the book as a series of scorecards for the major countries of the world. These scorecards discuss four main pillars of healthy economies and governments. He starts with an explanation of the importance of transport to trade. A country’s manufacturers benefit from low-cost transport. It’s a long-term competitive advantage to ship goods by water than overland. Second, he discusses the demographics of the major nations in the world. Countries with younger populations are significantly better off because these young workers earn salaries to support geriatrics’ benefits. Third, natural resources are essential for energy needs and manufacturing. Some countries are net exporters of oil; some are net importers. Same for coal, natural gas,  rare-earth minerals, etc. Fourth, topology. How easy is it for a country to defend itself? How is easy is it to move goods? To govern itself? Mountain ranges and deserts present natural defenses against invasion. How many acres of farmland per citizen exist within a country? How many sources of fresh water exist? That already fascinating. But there is a major geopolitical change afoot. After the Second World War, the United States did something no other victor of a major war has done. Instead of asking for reparations from the vanquished countries, the US convened most major countries at Bretton Woods. There, they laid out the vision for how the world would trade for the next 70 years. The United States Navy would protect all trade routes for free. In exchange, friendly countries would adopt democratic governments. This was an anti-communist strategy-. Because the US had the strongest navy in the world, and all of the others had been decimated, the US was supremely positioned to offer this “trade.” Today, the US is adopting an isolationist foreign policy. Disunited Nations predicts a future in which the United States no longer protects all trade and focuses instead on its own needs and markets. What happens to geopolitics if the US continues to be a net exporter of oil? Which countries rise? Which fall? Which continents are completely reshaped? One fair critique of the book is that it fails to discuss climate change. But aside from that, it is a compellingly argued view of the next 30 years of world affairs.

What’s going on in Startupland? Venture rounds are closing. We’ve seen seeds, As, Bs, and growth rounds in the past few weeks. And round announcements continue. Valuations are coming down a bit, but they are all over the map. It’s too early to draw any conclusions about pacing, however. In fundraising conversations, founders are candid. Founders share the growth story of the business before the onset of the virus, and few of them have the visibility to project end of year performance. Some founders in market today are running dual track processes, choosing between raising capital and pushing toward profitability within a certain time frame. When asked about the decision criteria for selecting a venture partner, one founder replied with a single phrase: speed to close. Many founders are wondering about the SBA programs and are looking for clarity on the rules. There are several programs including unemployment benefits for furloughs, deferment of payroll tax, and also forgivable loans (loans that evolve to grants). The key open question is whether the affiliation rule will admit venture-backed startups. Historically, startups haven’t been able to access SBA programs because of this affiliation rule. The rule says that all employees of affiliated companies must be considered headcount. For startups, this means every employee of every startup for every investor. Quickly, these numbers exceed the 500 employee limit. If you have questions, consult your board member or company counsel. Different companies are seeing varying effects. Some have seen demand drop almost entirely. Others, observe slower pipeline creation, and customers request more favorable payment terms. Some are seeing significant churn. A few benefit from the move to work from home.  Most businesses have begun to manage the company monthly, rather than quarterly because of this volatility. There’s a renewed focus on product-led growth and web-based demand generation. The Federal government has become an important target for new business, particularly for enterprise companies because the budgets are stable. Management teams are learning to lead teams entirely on video. Also, they are looking for ways to gauge productivity and employee happiness as teams adjust. How do you onboard an employee entirely remotely? It’s a question that keeps popping up. HR teams are on overdrive fielding questions about benefits and staffing, while trying to manage their part of the company remotely. It’s a period of broad, abrupt change. As I’ve written before, once we’re through these hardships, I expect a Cambrian explosion of innovation. If there’s one thing about founders and entrepreneurs that I’ve witnessed time and again, it’s their ability to innovate during upheaval.

I was reading an article in the NY Times about how we’re all using much more internet than we have been . Consequently, YouTube is throttling video quality, and some of our services are slower than before. I’ve also heard anecdotally that some forms of content marketing are doing well in an era when knowledge workers sit before our laptops all day. I wondered where I could find some interesting data about these patterns. I couldn’t find real-time data about bandwidth, but Google’s Trends product does show near up to date Google queries, which is a good proxy. First, I started with the two behemoths of working from home software: Slack and Zoom. Stewart Butterfield tweeted about the growth of active users in the last few weeks, from 10m to 12.5m . Take a look at the differences in search queries between Zoom and Slack. Zoom is basically vertical. In talking to a few friends at larger companies, I’ve learned their IT teams have been struggling to deploy VPN (virtual private networking infrastructure) to all their employees, who are suddenly working from home. Some had mentioned the importance of security to accompany the broader network perimeter. Though the data does show a spike in VPN interest, there’s no commensurate bump for security. First things first - just get people online, then secure them. How about the big platform SaaS companies: Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, and Microsoft? Everyone but Microsoft is flat. The difference in query volumes might be due to a similar phenomenon to Slack because of Microsoft’s Teams product. But it also might be tied to massive loads on their infrastructure. ZDNet reported demand for Azure is up 775% . As for marketing to people in front of computers all day, the webinar is the new meetup, conference, whitepaper, online ad, or any other campaign that one might have run in 2019. These charts show our working patterns have morphed radically in just a few weeks. And within the search patterns of your customers are likely some valuable insights to mine. The Google AdWords Keyword Tool is another promising place to start .

In 2015, we partnered with two young founders to build Dremio. Tomer Shiran and Jacques Nadeau had just left MapR, and they came to work from our offices in Menlo Park. We shared a vision for a new way of working with data. Today, the company is announcing a $70M Series C to help them along that journey. More data is being stored in data lakes like Amazon S3 and Azure Data Lake Storage. At the same time, the BI landscape has blossomed. Analysts and product managers and sales operations teams deploy Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Superset, and many other tools to parse their data. There needs  to be a layer between them to make all that data accessible to these users - a data lake engine. That’s Dremio. If you keep data in cloud data lake stores, and need a system to make that data accessible to analysis tools at interactive speed - without moving it - you’re looking for Dremio. Under the hood, a number of query acceleration technologies combine to make queries 10x+ faster. And because the system doesn’t move data, your team reduces its data analysis costs at the same time. In the last five years, the industry has evolved the way Tomer and Jacques anticipated. O’Reilly calls this Next Architecture . Amazon operates its data lakes in this way . So do Microsoft, Pfizer, UBS, NCR, and many others. At Redpoint, we’re passionate about innovations in data. We believe that the best companies run on data-based decision making. We wrote a book about winning with data with Frank Bien, the CEO of Looker. And we’re grateful to be a part of the Dremio journey. Oh, and if you’re looking for a good conversation starter with a Dremio employee, ask them about the origins of their mascot, the narwhal. As the team jokes, it’s the only real unicorn.

I read an op-ed in Bloomberg last week written by a stock trader who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the 1989 crash. His manager brought him into his office. The trader feared his manager would fire him. Instead, his manager told him that these kinds of crises accelerate change and that he should embrace them. I’m struggling to find the link now, but if I do, I will update this blog post with it. Since then, I’ve been asking myself, what changes will this crisis accelerate? Obviously, telecommuting/videoconferencing adoption will have accelerated. As many of us learn how to manage our days and our businesses exclusively through video, it will be more natural in the future to do so even when we can meet in person. In a related vein, my partner Alex suggested to me that telemedicine will become normalized. For those with non-urgent conditions, telemedicine provides triage and care without risking the health of others. The corollary to working online will be software to improve collaboration for distributed teams. In tandem, security software spend is sure to grow. As colleagues communicate more ideas online, companies will have to secure these thoughts to protect their intellectual property. I wonder if we will get to a point where we are routinely selling and deploying costly and complicated enterprise software entirely remotely. We already do this today for software with contract values at $50k. Could we do it at $500k or $5M? Video might quicken the de-urbanization of the US. More Americans would like to live in rural communities than would like to live in cities . commuting patterns, travel patterns, living patterns, they may all change. Delivery and logistics are booming. Amazon will hire more than 100,000 workers; Instacart is hiring 300,000 workers; Walmart will recruit 150,000.  Certainly, some of this spike is due to transient conditions. But the US has the potential to increase grocery delivery 5x if we look to other developed nations as a proxy for long-term adoption. Entertainment is changing. Formula One drivers now compete in online races since organizers paused the season. It’s not hard to imagine a world of eSports that’s a hybrid of real-world and virtual. Better for the leagues and athletes to sell more products and subscriptions, better for the fans who engage more, over longer seasons, in different formats. Another question I’ve been wondering is about US college education. The increasing student debt burden is unsustainable. The typical student borrower graduates with about $30,000 worth of debt,  while tuition grows 8% per year. As more students learn to learn online, will their willingness to pay for on-campus college decline? And could online learning create a better learning experience at a fraction of the price, changing the return on investment calculations for going to college? I’m sure there are many impacts outside the world of technology on medicine, drug discovery, energy production, and many other facets of how we work and live. These types of crises accelerate change. What will this crisis accelerate in your ecosystem?

I wrote earlier this week about estimating the impact to growth rates during this challenging time. Speaking with startups, I’ve collected a list of disciplines that are going to become very important in the next period. First, transparent communication. David Sacks wrote Happy Talk versus Hard Talk , which is an excellent post on how to communicate during a crisis. There is no better example than Winston Churchill. As you articulate communication plans, speak with transparency, candor, and gravity. Arne Sorenson’s corporate address to the Marriott company is a role model . Second, gauging customer health. Most SaaS companies will have existing customers. Some of these customers will be insulated from the virus. Others may benefit from it. Many of them will suffer from it. Customer success and account management teams should focus on understanding customer health. This is important to project churn rates, assess timing of software payments, and estimate the impact on cash flows/burn. If a meaningful fraction of customers no longer pay the balance of their annual contract on the renewal date, then your startup’s cash flows will worsen. It’s important to anticipate that and plan assuming it.  Some startups may face meaningful attrition within their customer bases. Estimating this ahead of time is an important exercise before developing a new financial model. Third, moving from annual planning to quarterly or monthly planning. The volatility in the market is so great that long term projections aren’t likely to be meaningful. It might be worth reverting to an earlier stage of the 4 sales commission structures . Alternatively, it might be worth moving sales teams to monthly goals or management by objectives (MBO). Fourth, runway elongation. This can be done in many ways: raising capital, borrowing debt, and dunning. Dunning is the process of collecting outstanding payments and communicating with customers about them. DSO or days sales outstanding is the highest level metric to understand the company’s ability to dun. The CFI has a formula for calculating DSO here . Getting a handle on cash flows is critical for companies with smaller balance sheets. Fifth, novel forms of demand generation. Some sales teams are focusing not on closing new business, but building the pipeline for customers by offering products and services for free or a nominal cost during the challenging time. Building trust today will be rewarded with friendship, trust, and a contract later on. For example, Zoom has a section of their website dedicated to helping people . Sixth, leadership. Great leadership is different than great management. This was the topic of my conversation with Nick Caldwell, the Chief Product Officer at Looker, which was scheduled for SaaStr. Management and leadership are different. Management is about keeping the trains running on time and creating stability. Leadership is about identifying change and opportunities to evolve, and inspiring people to pursue them.

As we readjust to the impacts of the coronavirus, I’ve been asking myself: what is a basic useful model for estimating the growth impact to a software company? Of course, every business should develop a more conservative model, focused primarily on cash management to provide a longer runway. I expect the venture market to slow round counts for a quarter, but then resume. As growth rates fall, valuations should move similarly. My hunch originates from this analysis of the 2008 crisis . But it’s too early to say for sure. Getting back to the original question, what’s a basic model to box the impact of the virus to a business? Here’s a basic model you can download and play with the inputs. You can change the bolded numbers.  The idea is to create a ballpark estimate. Let’s use the example in the sheet. This is a company at 15M in ARR. They were growing at 20% per quarter before the virus or 107% annually. The company estimates that Q2 bookings will fall by 90% in Q2, 75% in Q3, and 50% in Q4 relative to their 10% quarterly growth rate. Instead of growing 107% annually, they will grow 40%. The COVID Growth/ARR Growth shows the growth rate is about 58% of the previously projected growth rate. This is a very high-level tool. It doesn’t model cash, hiring, account churn, new latency in sales cycles. But it’s a quick way to understand the impact to a business’ growth trajectory during this turbulent time.

What could happen to the fundraising market in the coronavirus era where organizers cancel events, the financial markets suffer from a bear market, and there is a lot of uncertainty? The most recent event to use as an analogy is the 2008 financial crisis. In 2008, I had just joined the venture industry, and then Lehman fell. So this was a bit of a trip down memory lane. Let’s look at the data. In 2006, VCs invested about $3.5B per quarter in seed, A, B, and C rounds. That grew to about $5B per quarter in 2007 and early 2008. Then the investing velocity fell by half to $2.9B, $2.7B, and $2.3B in the quarters following the crash. The market bounced back to similar levels once in Q2 2010, but needed eight quarters to return to its previous volumes. Let’s break down the trends by series. The earlier the stage the company, the less it was impacted. That’s clearest in the seed chart. Seed investments suffered a 50% fall in Q3 2008, but the market came right back in Q4 and continued to increase in volume. This might be for a few reasons: valuations fell, no need to reprice/recap companies, and typically recessions are great markets to start startups . The Series A market started growing in Q4 and then grew steadily through 2012. The Series B market had a nice resurgence as well, followed by a retrenchment in late 2010 and then another surge. The Series C was the most recalcitrant to recovery. I suspect this is because there was a valuation reset and the market needed to adjust more than in earlier categories. This chart shows median round size over the same period. We can use median round size as a proxy for valuation because typically, VCs buy a certain amount of a startup. Seed rounds stayed constant at $300k (different era!). Series A round sizes fell from $4M to $2.6M (a 35% drop) and then rebounded over the next 8 quarters. Series B rounds fell from $10M to $6M. Series Cs fell from $14M to $8.5M (a 40% drop). By deal count, however, it was business as usual across the early fundraising rounds by count. Aside from Q3 2008 which saw a dip, VCs were still investing in as many rounds. Valuations and round sizes were the main contributing factor to the decline in VC dollars invested. In a more challenging financial environment, startups typically burn less, so they grow less quickly. Slower growth means slower appreciation in company value, so the valuation multiple on ARR should be less. At least that’s my theory. Comparing one crisis to another is one way of trying to gauge the potential impact, and it’s a bit dodgy because so many things are different. If history is a guide, though, we can look to the 2008 financial crisis. In 2008, the venture market saw depressed valuations for 18-24 months, but a similar deal velocity.

Recently, we welcomed Lisa Lawson to SaaS Office Hours to talk about building a channel go-to-market strategy for SaaS companies. Lisa built the channel at Optimizely, which accounted for a meaningful fraction of new business. I learned quite a bit from the sessions with the five companies who attended the one-on-one sessions. Here are my notes. Where to Start The first place to start is to learn to sell your startup’s product well. To make a partnership successful, your startup will need to teach another sales team to sell your product. That means understanding your ideal customer profile, developing enablement materials to close those customers, and training new account executives to succeed in that effort consistently. Internal Clarity Different roles in a company may have different goals for channel development. The CEO may want a partnership for brand association. The sales team asks for more leads. The customer success team would like help deploying the software to new customers. The head of BD must determine the right priorities for the company, socialize them, and develop a plan to achieve them. Types of Partnerships After scaling sales enablement successfully, the next step is to understand where your customers are. Where do they buy? Who do they consult? Where do they convene? And what relationships are important in the buyer journey? Depending on the answer, you’ll have to decide which types of partnerships are the best to engage them. There are four types of partnerships we discussed. Technology partnerships: these are integrations with other products. Most of the time, customers suggest these integrations as part of their feedback to account management and customer support. Many times, these technology alliances improve each product’s appeal. Channel partnerships: this means another company’s salesforce is selling your product. These sales teams go by many names: agencies, system integrators, value-added resellers. Partner enablement, educating the sales team, is important to succeeding with these types of relationships. In addition, agreeing to the right economic incentives is important. Quota retirement is arguably the most important one. This means the channel’s sales teams are paid commission for selling your product. The structure of these relationships is complicated and should be the subject of another post. OEM partnerships: a bigger company integrates your product into theirs. For example, many companies bought Looker in an OEM model. By buying Looker, they could offer reporting and analytics to their customers without having to build or maintain the analytics software. OEM relationships can be a good way to get to market quickly. But, there’s a tradeoff. Your customers may not know that it’s your product under the hood, so while you may gain a bunch of revenue, your brand equity won’t appreciate. Marketplaces: AWS marketplace, Heroku marketplace, Salesforce marketplace. These are more transactional channels where you pay a fee to be admitted, and then the marketplace takes a rake on the transaction. The more streamlined the customer onboarding, the more effective marketplaces will be for you. Typically, marketplace entries with a call us form are less effective. We covered much more in the session but those are some of the key highlights. If you’d like to learn more about channel from Lisa, you can visit her website here and contact her here .

I was on a panel yesterday to speak about the impacts of the coronavirus on financial markets and startups. Later in the afternoon, I read the Sequoia black swan memo. So I figured today, I’ll summarize my outlook on the next few months. Startup Growth Rates For startups, things will likely slow down. Longer sales cycles will be the leading indicator. At least, that’s my key metric for startup health over the next few months. With travel curtailed, closing new customers will require selling over the phone/video - and it’s a bit harder to build trust, particularly for big deals over the phone. Bookings will be more volatile than in the past as a result. So, more pipeline is necessary to create consistency. However, there’s a confounding factor: pipeline generation will be harder. Teams will be working from home. Consequently, we are all adapting to new working patterns. Additionally, organizers are canceling conferences. Inevitably, event lead generation will decline. Marketing teams and BDRs will need to rely on other channels and will saturate them. Everyone will do this at the same time, increasing CPCs/CPMs/CPAs and flooding email inboxes with marketing materials. Response rates will fall. Startups should prepare a more conservative financial plan that delays non-essential hiring, conserves cash, and prepares the business. Equally important is creating a set of leading indicators that, once triggered, the business shifts to the conservative plan. Some executive teams may prefer to move immediately to the conservative plan. Others may prefer to wait until they trip those key leading indicators:  slower sales cycles and weaker lead generation. It depends on the business. In particular, the size of the balance sheet and the urgency to the buyer. Fundraising Fundraising velocity will likely slow from the fast pace we’ve seen for the same reasons as slowing sales: it’s just a bit harder to meet people. Valuations may be pressured for companies raising capital now with more conservative growth plans. If startups project slower growth trajectories, then valuations will fall because the growth rates are the highest correlate of valuation multiples. Also, the volatility in the stock market may pressure valuations, particularly in the growth stage. But as I wrote about earlier this week, the valuation multiples haven’t moved materially. We’re still close to all time highs, so this might be a bit more muted than one would expect. Bullwhip Effect More broadly, I suspect many parts of the economy (and startups) will suffer from the Bullwhip Effect . The idea originates from MIT. I describe it in depth here and I’m pasting an image below. The idea is that small changes in retail demand amplify into big swings up the supply chain. In this case, it’s a beer supply chain. The small perturbations in retail demand create a whip-like effect upstream. The brewer’s orders whipsaw up and down as retailers and the rest over-order and then under-order. This will happen in many different industries. The net result is unpredictability. The volatility is going to sow doubt in investors’ minds. That will slow investment and lower valuations in public markets. Monetary Policy I interpret the Fed’s recent 0.5% rate cut as a way to maintain consumer confidence and maintain consumer spending to smooth out demand variance. Consumer confidence is important because consumer spending is driving most of the projected growth in GDP in the US in 2020. With a projected 0.2% monthly increase straightlined for the rest of 2020, that implies about a 2.4% GDP growth. Before the coronavirus, the Fed was already projecting GDP growth of less than 2.0% , so consumer spending is critical. As a counterpoint, business spending was soft at the end of last year and this uncertainty won’t help. So we should expect lower GDP in the US than we’re projecting. This will again pressure the public markets. Outlook Ultimately, the more we can smooth any shocks and discontinuities, the better the overall economy will be because we won’t be subject to as great of a whip effect. The challenge is that each business will act independently. They may reduce their spending in small ways that cumulatively engender large swings. I’m hopeful that the volatility we’re seeing today will subside quickly. For this quarter, it’s prudent to construct a more conservative plan and establish those leading indicators that trigger a switch to it.

The 9 Disciplines of Great SaaS Companies remains one of the most popular posts on marketing on this blog. It’s a wonderful framework by Bill Macaitis, who was the CMO at Zendesk and Slack. Gabe Larsen , the VP of Growth at Kustomer, has a marketing scorecard that goes one level deeper and breaks down some of the key elements of key marketing processes. The framework breaks down the key marketing operational roles into six buckets. Each bucket has a set of disciplines that the team scores. The value of this framework is two-fold. First, it enumerates the important priorities for a marketing team. For me, it was the first time I’d seen a taxonomy laid out plainly and simply. And second, the scorecard provides a way for a team to understand their strengths and weaknesses. You might score each on a 1 to 10 scale. Let’s walk through each quickly. Product Marketing is the starting point for marketing. It includes: market intelligence: what are your competitors doing? company positioning: what is the narrative of the business? Where does the company play? who does it sell to? sales enablement: how strong are the materials sales teams use to pitch? product content: the website, blog, whitepapers that describe the product analyst relations: how is the team engaging the key analysts in the space? Comms Marketing Design: to what extent does the marketing team have access to the right designers? PR: public relations strength Content: the capability to produce content Social: social media Internal Comms: often forgotten, but important because every employee sells the business and contributes to the brand. How effective is the team at enabling each employee to sell the company successfully? Demand Generation these are all pretty straightforward. ABM is account-based marketing, is the sole clarification I’ll make. Business Development how effective is the company at identifying, contacting, qualifying, and approving partners to co-sell products? Customer Marketing Reputation: how strong is the company’s reputation with customers? Community: how vibrant is the customer community? Communication: how effective is the lifecycle marketing effort to existing customers? Marketing Operations Process: How well defined is the process for executing marketing campaigns+ Systems: to what extent is the right software deployed? Budget: does the team have sufficient capital? Reporting: teams win with data. What is the sophistication of metrics to measure success? You can find a downloadable copy of this spreadsheet here. . If you have comments or suggestions on how to improve this framework or have others to share, let me know on twitter .

This morning, there were many tweets talking about the impact of the coronavirus on the fundraising environment. It’s as a result of last weeks’ wild swings in the stock market. According to Koyfin’s analysis technology was the second hardest hit sector, falling 14%. The S&P overall was down 11%. Let’s double-click on the impact of last week on the valuation environment. This is our familiar forward multiples chart. It includes a basket of all the next-generation software companies since 2014.* You will see that multiples are still meaningfully above the median of 6X which is the thin blue line. But, forward revenue valuation multiples are down about 12%, consistent with the Koyfin analysis. Over the last three months, more than half of the companies have seen a multiple expansion. The median change is +2% despite the volatility last week. Zoom has benefited from a 56% increase, as have RingCentral, Shopify, and SmartSheet. If you look at the distribution of forward multiples, we still see some incredibly elevated levels. Zoom is at 33x. Shopify at 24x. Okta at 20x. So, despite the volatility last week, multiples haven’t corrected. Valuations are identical to three months ago. Returning to the tweets about the changes in the fundraising market: the private market tends to move much slower to changes in valuation than the public market does. Considering that the public market still values these companies the way they were valued three months ago, this suggests that the private market should not change its behaviors. The most tangible difference in environment may be more videoconferencing meeting s and fewer attendees to large conferences in the next few weeks. The bigger question is whether software purchasing habits change because of reduced travel and networking. We will see that in the earnings reports coming out over the next month, and startups may begin to observe it in longer sales cycles. That’s the best leading indicator of choppiness in the market ahead in Startupland. So, if you are worried about coronavirus impacting your business, pay attention to sales cycle durations. Note, I have changed my data source for forward multiples which means that some of these numbers are not the same as in previous charts. This is because the information providers calculate consensus forward multiples differently. Notice: I hold Zoom and Microsoft stock and others as investments in index funds.

If you’re looking for a primer on many of the responsibilities of being a startup CEO, read The Great CEO Within . Matt Mochary wrote the book. He founded a company which he sold to MCI and now coaches startup CEOs, amongst other philanthropic efforts. The best part of this book is that it combines descriptions of the key jobs to be done and the frameworks to accomplish them. As CEOs grow their teams and their companies, their calendars densify with meetings until there’s no space to work. “The top goal framework will help you fix this. Greg McKeown, who wrote a phenomenal book on productivity called Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less, boils this down to one key concept: Schedule two hours each day (i.e., put an event in your calendar) to work on your top goal only. And do this every single workday. Period.” There are other tips. On meetings: Encourage more junior members of the team to speak first to ensure their views are heard and unbiased by more senior teammates. Move away from presentations to written briefs that attendees read at the beginning of a meeting. Amazon is well known for this technique. On delivering feedback: ask permission; state the trigger for the feedback; share your emotional reaction to the trigger; share your opinion, and then request what you would like to see. Last, ask if the person accepts the feedback. These frameworks are useful in many ways. For me, these frameworks provide a sense of confidence in a conversation that I’m conducting it well. And a discussion of Bain’s RAPID - a coordination system is used at Coinbase and many other places. The acronym stands for Recommend, Agree, Perform, Input, Decide. This is a way of managing teams by explicitly declaring who Recommends an action, who Agrees, who will Perform it. And then whose Input must be solicited and last, who Decides. This process ensures important decisions are well socialized. The book is structured simply and the chapters are short - maybe 1000 words each. Plus there’s commentary from the stellar Alex MacCaw along the way that voices the perspective of a modern day successful founder. It’s well worth the few hours to read this manual that covers topics from Conscious Leadership to Fundraising, and shares habits to make you and your teams more successful. It’s a terrific distillation of years of experience across many startups.

This is the theoretically ideal organizational chart of a startup. There’s a CEO at the top in red, VPs in orange, senior contributors in dark gray, team leads in green, and junior individual contributors in light gray. This is the org chart of the typical startup. It’s a very different in reality. The departments are lopsided and scraggly. The span of control is out of control. Sometimes there are directors running teams that should be headed by VPs. Other times, departments are missing leaders and so another leader takes the helm. Is this so bad? As a startup evolves from product market fit to scaling, organizational design becomes an executive imperative. To scale means hiring lots of people. Hiring a large team is necessary, but insufficient. That team needs the right structure to thrive. Span of control the number of people reporting to a manager. Most managers work well with 6-7 reports. Weekly one-on-ones, career planning, coaching, training and development consume a big chunk of manager’s time. Managers bear another major responsibility: building their teams. In high growth companies, leaders may spend upwards of 30% of their time recruiting - about one to two days a week. First meetings, second meetings, references, hiring committee meetings - it adds up quickly. If your span of control is sixteen, your Monday and Tuesday are consumed entirely by one-on-ones. Combine that with recruiting and you have one day a week for the day job. That won’t work. Many startups go through the first transition from founding team to a few VPs and then don’t think through the importance of middle management. The reason middle managers are key is they cut the span of control and defray the recruiting responsibility, freeing leaders to spend time running the company. In the transition from product market fit to scaling, this is a key step. And it’s easy to overlook that necessity to scale.

When I started in venture capital, one of the questions I learned to ask very early on was competition. Founders would often reply that competition validates the opportunity. At the time, I thought it was a canned response, a clever parry, to avoid answering the question directly. I’ve since realized I was wrong. Let’s say you’re creating a category. You need to cross the chasm and reach the second half of the technology adoption curve. I found a beautiful technology curve online and have replicated it above. A small number of innovators and early adopters might use a minimal feature set product. After that, the company must cross the chasm by building and selling a solution that the rest of the market wants to buy. How do you do this when creating a new category? Recently, SaaS Office Hours at Redpoint had the privilege of chatting with Nick Mehta and Anthony Kennada about the way they created a category with customer success. Throughout Redpoint’s history, we’ve invested in lots of companies to create categories like NuBank, Hashicorp, Twilio, LaunchDarkly, Gremlin, Guild Education, Chorus.ai, among many others. Both of those experiences have brought us to the same conclusion. Sellers and marketers need to spend millions of dollars to create a category. At the early stages of market creation, the most threatening competitor isn’t the startup down the street. It’s non-consumption . Simply put, the customer does nothing, buys nothing. Non-consumption is the most-worrisome failure mode. Suppose it costs $200M of sales and marketing dollars to create a category. If you are a founder who can raise $200M because of your connections or your background or some other unique attributes, then you are an excellent position to be able to create the category solely yourself. You will raise the $200 million, and you’ll benefit handsomely from the winner take most dynamics. But it’s far more common to see a collection of founders band together and pool their capital to create the category. Sometimes, this is an explicit collaboration, a group of companies that create an industry group to further the industry. Sometimes it’s more implicit or passive. But the dynamic is the same. In effect, they pool their capital to create the category. Over time, I’ve realized how wrong I was in those initial meetings. The sales and marketing dollars are better spent growing the market, fighting non-consumption, rather than duking it out with competitors in a small, early market.

One of the most consistent errors made in sales projections and planning is mismatching the ramp time to the sales cycle. What does this mean? If my startup has a 9 months sales cycle and the VP of Sales projects a six month ramp time, my startup is committing this error. How should one expect a new account executive to start delivering bookings in their first quarter if the typical sales cycle is longer than the ramp period? One argument is that the territory is warm. Leads have been nurtured in that territory for a while. The account executive starts with business that has made some progress in their customer lifecycle journey. Alternatively, a head of sales may be interviewing for salespeople who have a book of business already. If that’s the case, one could the AE’s sales cycles should be shorter than the norm because they have relationships. There might be other examples of rationalizations for a more aggressive ramp than a typical sales cycle. But as a business begins to scale, this assumption is one that often triggers a sales target miss of a quarter. There are downstream effects too. Many AEs may may miss their first quarter, suggesting that there’s a bigger problem in the organization. For example, lead quality, sales training, funnel conversion rates. And things can spiral from theer. Many management teams feel a pressure to project a sales cycle faster than historicals. On one hand, shorter sales cycles are more attractive to investors. I’ve written about why it’s a competitive advantage . Let’s throw away outliers in the data set, one might say. But that can lead to this mismatch error. Better to be more conservative. Look at the data. Newer AEs may need longer ramp periods (which of course costs more in burn), but may yield better quota attainment later on. The greater the contract value, the greater the likelihood of longer sales processes typical of enterprises, the greater the chances of this phenomenon. If your startup has missed a quarter, be sure to look at AE quota attainment by quarter and compare it to sales cycles. You may find that there is a mismatch between your sales cycles and your ramp time.

“Basketball can be modeled as two-biased random walks. Each team has a probability. Each team has a probability of scoring each trip down the court…this model suggests a strategy: stronger teams should speed up the game to create more possessions.” If you shoot more accurately, then more possessions over time creates a greater delta in the final score. This is a great idea from Scott Page’s the Model Thinker that I find I quote a lot when discussing competitive strategy. Does this theory pan out? Let’s go to the data for the current basketball season . The Milwaukee Bucks have won the most games this season with 45 games of 52 played. Their shooting attempts per game is third in the league at 91.5 field goals per game. Their field goal shooting percentage is second at 48.2%. Their field goals attempted is 5th in the league. The combination of top decile shooting and near-top decile shots per game produces the best points per game of 119. And the fact that they capture 15% more defensive rebounds than the next best team doesn’t hurt. So, yes. This model of thinking about competition is valuable in business. Suppose you have two startups competing directly. Imagine yours is the one with the better shooting percentage. In business, the analogy might be competitive win rate. Your sales teams wins 5 percentage points more customer contracts than the competitor. Let’s ignore other situations like single vendor sales processes, replacements, upgrades, etc. The winning strategy is to accelerate the game. For startups, that means starting as many sales conversations as possible. Over time, the better win rate garners more market share. If you assume that the company benefits from solid net dollar retention, something magical happens. The compounding effects of growth create a geometrically scaling advantage - in theory, at least. What if you’re the team or the company with lesser shooting percentage? You can’t play the same game and win. You must change the game to focus on three point shooting or set plays or some other aspect where you can create a relative advantage. In the world of business, that might mean focusing on a customer segment, a vertical, or solution selling. And this is the dynamic we see in many parts of business: competitors vying to shift the competitive landscape. Like all economic theories, this one simplifies quite a lot. Execution is never perfect. Scaling sales teams and companies are hard. And the teams with the best shooting records and most attempts per game may not win the championship. But building a strategy around this idea can be a useful exercise for an executive team in a competitive market.

The debate about partnering with Snowflake went back and forth during the investment committee meeting. It was March 2014. My partners, Satish and John, had met the company and were proposing to lead the Series B. The company was about two years away from launch and heading straight into a dance with elephants. Google and Amazon both offered competing products and were already in market. Here was a plucky group of founders with deep technical expertise seeking to take on the incumbents with a novel architecture. And that was the bet the deal team advocated: Snowflake’s superior architecture will triumph in the end when users begin to query petabytes of data. You can read more about the investment memo and diligence that supported the investment in the post my partner Satish wrote about the experience from his vantage point . Snowflake was part of the same focus on next generation data technologies that led to our investment in Looker, another enduring company, that Google acquired last year. Today, Snowflake is announcing a major milestone: a funding round that values the business at $12.4B. It’s a far cry from 20 people and sub-$100M valuation in 2014. Snowflake is the fastest growing enterprise software company we’ve seen, and we’ve analyzed many . It grew 174% year on year at scale . Okta also reported it’s the fastest growing software across their customer base, growing about 275% . The story is far from written. The journey has had it’s share of ups and downs, with many, many highlights. It’s remarkable to look back and remember how our journey with Snowflake began: with a debate over a 7 page memo and a deal team that was passionate about the size of the market and the uniqueness of the team.

Have you ever sold a product while working at the market leader? How about from the market challenger? If you’ve done both, you know how different the role of a salesperson can be in each of these businesses. having them both, I can tell you that though the jobs have very similar titles, the work is quite different. The market leader benefits from the strength of its brand. Buyers compare other products to the leader. For account executives, everything is easier. The brand’s strength eases prospecting work. Internal champions prefer recommending the leader to their superiors because it’s easier, increasing close rates. And if that implementation fails, there is lesser downside risk. Salespeople leverage the trust the brand has created. Market challenger sales are very different. They often require educating the customer on a new way of thinking. The salesperson must convince the buyer not to go with the leader. In fact, this is where the name challenger sale originates . Prospecting can be more challenging because of a lack of awareness. So, salespeople must find different techniques to succeed and develop trust. Sales cycles lengthen, demand more work, and consumer more time. When you interview salespeople for your startup, do you consider their experience at a market leader or market challenger? How does that map to your business? This is an important mental model to use when hiring salespeople. Playbook creation versus playbook execution is a second mental model for sales hiring. In very early stage companies, AEs must create selling playbooks and improve them. How do you sell a new product? Figuring out the motion requires time. How should the team structure the proof of concepts (PoCs)/trials? What should the 30 second sales pitch contain? Which value propositions are the most important? Few startups have answered these questions at the early stage. Typically, founders and early employees have leveraged their networks to close the first set of customers. Perhaps the business developed the product alongside a handful of friendly businesses in exchange for sweetheart deal (highly discounted). Transitioning from those relationship-based sales into a more scalable model requires developing a new way of thinking, finessing messaging, and developing a close process that might be novel. As the business scales, the company will have developed those playbooks. The specification for salespeople evolves to someone who can execute those playbooks effectively. These are two mental models that are useful in evaluating salespeople and matching them to the stage of the startup.

Net Dollar Retention is one of the most important metrics is a SaaS business. It measures the value of a cohort of customers over time including expansion, cross-sell, and churn (loss of revenue). But how do you measure NDR? Imagine this is your company’s data. The first column is the cohort month for each cohort in a year. The second column is the revenue of this cohort in their first month. The second colum is a random number between -20 and +20 that is the NDR for that cohort. The last column is the ending revenue of that cohort. Month Starting Revenue Percent Change Ending Revenue 1 5812 -20 4650 2 3342 0 3342 3 322 12 361 4 5438 0 5438 5 5549 14 6326 6 216 16 251 7 9217 16 10692 8 5383 -6 5060 9 7660 -8 7047 10 2159 5 2267 11 9147 -11 8141 12 752 -12 662 Total 54997 54235 You could calculate NDR as the average of the Percent Change column. You could calculate it as the percent growth in total ending revenue compared to the total starting revenue. You could aggregate the data by quarter and average that. In the first case (average of each cohort), your NDR would be 0.5%.
In the second case (annual total), your NDR would be -1.4%.
In the third case (average of each quarter), your NDR would be -2.6%. So which do you choose? If you’re fundraising, certainly the last one. And if you’re managing internal company goals, then certainly the first one. Just kidding. Let’s take a step back. First, why is this happening? Why aren’t all the averages the same? Simpson’s paradox . The overall average of a data set may be different than the averages of different groups. We see this paradox all over the place: college admissions, sports performance data, and medicine. Which is right? Well, there’s no industry standard today. These are the summaries from their public disclosures. Alex Clayton collected the list here .
Zendesk reports the annual change in cohort monthly recurring revenue.
Twilio calculates it as the annual change in cohort quarterly recurring revenue.
Marketo uses the change in cohort revenue for each of the last month of each quarter; for example, June revenue/March revenue.
Okta and Box measure 12 month bookings changes for each cohort. So how do you pick the right one for your business? The first principle is to align it to your billing cycles. If your business has annual contracts, then measuring annual growth makes sense. If your business is utility based, monthly is a better measure or perhaps quarterly to smooth out revenue. The second principle is to share how you calculate NDR and stick to it, so it’s consistent. And the third principle is to benchmark your business to others who measure themselves in the same way.

When we announced our investment in and partnership with Mattermost about a year ago , I wrote about a new architecture for SaaS. I’m starting to see that architecture more and more, but with a twist. The idea behind the new architecture is split a SaaS app into code and the data. The SaaS company writes, updates, and maintains the code. And the customer manages the data. Typically, the data resides in the customer’s cloud account. This cloud account has many names but no real moniker yet. Some call it a VPC for virtual private cloud. Others call it cloud prem, a contraction of cloud and on-prem(ises). On premisis or on prem means deploying software on datacenters the customer owns. Today, many of those data centers are in the cloud, hence cloud prem. But the drivers are real. The first is cost. Cloud is more expensive for larger enterprises. Many are considering moving back to their own infrastructure and using the cloud to manage bursts. The second is control. If you’ve used the AWS IAM (identity access management) console, you realize how complex access control has become. This means securing cloud assets that may be open to the public or accessible via API means battling a Medusa. The third is compliance. More regulation seems a forgone conclusion in technology. Better to prepare now and be structured to manage legal process later by controlling data centrally. Assume this happens at some scale in the enterprise. Let’s fast forward a bit. Imagine an enterprise now has several, maybe a dozen applications deployed this way. They won’t have a database for each application. They’ll have one or two. And each piece of software will be pointed to those databases. That’s the twist. In the classic SaaS model, 12 SaaS products means 12 databases; each database  controlled by the vendor. In the cloud prem world, the databases are controlled by the customer and accessed by the SaaS product. In the simplest case, the customer has one database. The 12 SaaS products query the database for the data they want to. Each SaaS product is a different cut, filter, or view of that central single data store. It’s a change from point-to-point data to hub-and-spoke data. This may seem like a pretty simple advance but it’s  a fundamental rearchitecture that is going to change the way applications work. Today, an enterprise might have hundreds or thousands of applications. Each is a hermit, operating its own database in solitude. The very biggest create APIs for pushing and pulling data into other systems (eg, Salesforce App Exchange). That provides a huge amount of leverage to Salesforce, because they control the data. But if the customer controls the data, then power dynamics in the relationship change dramatically. The customer controls the data, and can reshape it, move it, share it with a competing vendor. And the customer can create a marketplace of applications to suit their own needs. And the integration between applications no longer has to be achieved at the application layer with Salesforce to Marketo APIs. Instead, it’s done at the database. Salesforce expects marketing data in a particular place in the database and reads it directly. Novel database querying engines like Dremio, Presto, GraphQL enable this vision. There are benefits to the SaaS vendors too in the form of higher gross margins. They won’t be paying for storage costs. The customer pays the cloud vendor directly. The trade is a much more complex deployment model. I’m painting a simple picture here to explain this vision. Reality will be far more complex - it always is. Technology integration will be harder. Enterprises will move pieces of their business over. But we’ll see this new architecture deployed in the mid-market as an innovation, just the way modern startups centralize on a single datawarehouse, like a Snowflake, while the bigger companies have several data stores. But this is the way enterprise software will be delivered in the future. Most of the market today believes that cloud-prem is about packaging the application to run on a Kubernetes cluster in a VPC, but it’s a much deeper, more fundamental evolution than that.

Nathan Heller published an article called Is Venture Capital Worth the Risk? in the New Yorker. It’s a well-researched critique of the venture industry. The key question he poses is: has the industry become so large that it needs to be disrupted? It’s a thought provoking question and a good opportunity to ask for feedback on how we can imrove. If you have ideas for how to improve venture capital for founders, please tweet me or send me an email with the link above. I’d love to hear them. What can we learn from an adjacent space? The evolution of the venture industry parallels the private equity industry. KKR started the leveraged buyout trend in the 1970s. A few others joined the fray and competition intensified, but fortunes were made. The LBO was reinvented after the Savings and Loan Crisis in the 1980s. Then these firms raised larger funds to invest in LBOs, but they diversified, too. Real estate, hedge funds, derivatives, all kinds of assets. In the 2000s, a wave of PE funds went public. Now, you can own shares in Blackstone, Blackrock, KKR, Carlyle among others. (If you want to read more, Merchants of Debt and King of Capital are good books.) Venture capital has evolved quite a bit in the past decade, in parallel ways to the PE industry. The competitive dynamics in the market where access to invest is more valuable than capital . This supply/demand shift that provides founders more leverage in conversations has catalyzed some innovation in venture. First, venture capital has become much bigger. 2018 and 2019 exceeded the heady days of 2000 in terms of dollars deployed. One major reason is startups stay private about 8 years longer, and this costs $100m+ or more in many cases. Second, as competition has intensified, VC funds have invested in platforms (we call it founder experience at Redpoint). These operating divisions of venture firms provide talent, marketing, PR, and business development services to startups. PE firms have similar operating platforms. Third, VCs have specialized. There are SaaS focused funds, crypto funds, bio funds, double bottom line funds, middle-of-the-country funds, diversity focused funds, university seed programs, and many other flavors. Some firms run multiple strategies: different industries, geographies, and stages, akin to PE specialization and diversification. No venture firms have yet gone public, but I wonder if we won’t see that occur before 2030. Also, more venture firms and startups are choosing debt as a non-dilutive financing alternative. Last, pricing stock has become much more sophisticated and analogous to public market valuations, particularly in Series B and later. There is no doubt that there are many more opportunities for venture capital to evolve, to provide better financial products and services to founders. As the scale of the industry has blossomed, market forces (competition and founder demand) have pushed the industry in positive ways. I hope those dynamics engender  more innovation in the venture market, so founders are better served and more innovation comes to the market.

Today, the world’s most valuable brand is Apple. Forbes estimates Apple’s brand is worth $205B. Why is Apple’s brand worth so much? It’s the trust the brand inspires in consumers. Apple customers know Apple the company. They understand the product philososphy, the history, the quality of typical Apple products, and the reputation for quality. A strong brand is the lagging indicator of having built trust. We won’t buy from people or companies we don’t trust. The same is true in software. Companies selling to engineers and technical buyers demonstrate technical prowess first, before pitching their product. Engineers from CockroachDB writes about chaos engineering . Mattermost shares best practices for running multi-cluster environments with Prometheus and Grafana . Gremlin uncovers the details of downtime at Heroku. Open source companies build trust by sharing the entirety of their codebase to the public. If the buyer has a question about the software, they can audit it themselves and communicate with the authors. This transparency builds trust. Enterprise buyers use third parties to buy software. They consult Gartner, Forrester, and others to establish trust in vendors. These research agencies diligence software products directly and through surveys. This is the reason analyst relations are so important. Presence on the magic quadrant confers trustworthiness. Of course, trust doesn’t stop with marketing. Slimy sales practices provokes distrust. Shoddy product quality erodes trust. Slow or opaque customer support also erodes trust. Every interaction with a customer is an opportunity to engender or erode trust. Brands are so valuable because they are the encapsulation of years long efforts to engender trust. That’s why Apple’s brand is worth about one-quarter of their market cap. Trust accelerates sales cycles, creates long term defensibility, and increases the value of a business overall. It’s the core purpose of marketing.

Payback period is one of the best composite diagnostic metrics of product market fit. I’ve written before about the benefits of short payback periods . In short, startups with shorter payback periods require less capital and also grow more quickly. In 2020, what is an excellent payback period[1]? Here is a group of publicly traded companies sorted by estimated payback period[2]. Zoom is at the top with a payback period of just over 3 months. DataDog, Slack, Crowdstrike, and Twilio round out the top 5 at 7 months or less. Those are exceptionally efficient businesses. It bears noting that 4 of the top 5 started out as bottoms up businesses, which have grown to support enterprise customers as they’ve matured. Zoom, DataDog, Slack, and Twilio all share this pattern. The top quartile is 15 months; the median is 22 months; and the bottom quartile is 29 months. These figures have increased over the past four years, but the change isn’t statistically significant. I was curious about any relationships that existed between sales efficiency and gross margin. One might hypothesize the greater the gross profit of a business, the better potential sales efficiency. But there’s no correlation. R^2 is -0.-04 - truly none. I also looked at sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue, which bore a similar result. I suspect average contract value may have some relationship with the sales efficiency though. Starting with a low ACV enables a company to expand accounts significantly. More importantly, it requires the company establish an efficient go-to-market from the outset;  a discipline that benefits the business throughout its life. [1] Just how do we define payback period? It is amount of time a customer repays the cost of customer acquisition with gross profit dollars. It’s also the inverse of the gross profit sales efficiency. [2] For these companies, I’m estimating payback period by using the marginal gross profit and total selling and marketing expenses each reports annually.

At this year’s Saastr Annual conference , I’m excited to interview Nick Caldwell . Nick has an incredible background. He started the PowerBI team at Microsoft and grew it from a small number of people to more than 300. He left to become VP Engineering at Reddit and tripled the size of the engineering team to 150 people in 18 months. And then he joined Looker as Chief Product Officer. In short, Nick has helped grow engineering and product teams from very small to very big three times. In preparing for the session, I’ve learnt a lot about Nick. One of the things I admire the most is his desire to mechanize the creation of leaders and managers. He writes about it quite a bit and has also delivered presentations on the topic. For example, he has a test for determining whether an engineer ought to pursue an architect career path or a manager career path . In addition, Nick differentiates between management and leadership . Many people conflate the two: great managers are great leaders. But they aren’t the same. You can be a great leader without managing people. And you can be a great manager without being a great leader. Last, Nick has a unique perspective on engineering management, having worked in big enterprises and smaller ones; and working for both enterprise and consumer companies. All these subjects will make for a great conversation and I’m certain I’ll learn more about them during our chat together.

Go to market questions are some of the most common questions startups discuss in board meetings. This is especially true around the end of year because many companies develop their financial plans. To help startups understand how their go to market teams compare to peers, Redpoint has constructed a survey. You can find the survey here . The survey will answer questions like: How does the sales team structure differ by stage? by target buyer? by price point? How do sales team compensate their account executives and their SDRs/BDRs? At what stage do startups hire VPs and C-level executives in each go to market role? Last year, we published the results on the Free Trial/Freemium survey and it was a huge success. We received more than 600 responses and the data was tremendously insightful. We hope to exceed those numbers this year. The survey has 30 questions. If you complete the survey, we will share with you the anonymized raw data so you can perform your own analyses. If you have questions, just message me on Twitter or send me an email.

We are 12 years into the longest bull market in US history and this bullishness has powered the venture market. Investors deployed $117 billion in 2019 up from $106 billion in 2018.. This market has grown 20% over the last five years. It’s been go, go, go for nearly a decade. However, Q4 2019 saw meaningful dip from Q3, but it’s too early to say whether it’s an aberration, or the beginning of a longer-term trend. I wondered if Softbank’s changes in investment strategy had much to do with it, but as the chart shows, they were not a meaningful contributor. Their investment is marked in the black line. The total number of rounds is a much more meaningful contributor. Since 2010, the number of round by quarter has followed a periodic growth, with consistent seasonality. That pattern of regularity broke in Q4. Typically, round counts in Q3 and Q4 are relatively flat, but in this case, we saw a reduction from approximately 2250 rounds to 1600 rounds, a decline of 29%. There may also be a recording lag in that some of the rounds completed in Q4 haven’t been announced yet. The mean and median round sizes tell some of the story. Mean round sizes have increased from 5 million in 2010 to 17.5 million in the last 10 years, across all rounds. A decrease in the number but an increase in check sizes means large around sizes for fewer companies, presumably, the clear winners in a category. As the bull market continues unabated after an incredible 2019, political uncertainty mounts in the face of an election year, and new geopolitical risks emerge, perhaps we are seeing the beginnings of more cautiousness in the venture market. However, you couldn’t characterize the venture market as conservative today with a straight face. Looking at where we are in terms of valuations, round sizes, total dollars deployed, and almost every other metric, the venture market today is at least close to if not the most ebullient venture market on record. So, when does it change? No one knows.  The sentiment in the valley continues to be positive and until investor confidence changes, I don’t foresee the trendlines deviating materially. There are certainly more questions being asked of technology than in the past. There is broad anti-tech sentiment in politics and in popular culture. Softbank’s turbulent 2019 was one of the key topics of the year. Gross margin was the defining characteristic of successful IPOs, and direct listings certainly made a splash last year. The real and more important question is what to do in this market. That answer never changes:  build businesses prudently and finance them when you can at reasonable valuations so the company can grow into them over time.

If you’re starting a SaaS company, should you prefer to sell to B2B or B2C companies? And if you would like to sell to both, how should you allocate your sales teams? If you were to hazard a guess about the share of B2C vs B2B companies, what would it be? I often find myself wondering this question in a board room or reading through S-1s of soon-to-be-public companies. What are the demographics of the customer base and how are they reflected in the sales team? Across all US companies, B2B companies outnumber B2C companies 1.6:1. For every B2C company, there are 1.6 B2B companies. Quick aside: some companies sell to both, but this analysis is a high level and defaults to the primary buyer, eg Google is B2C, Amazon is B2C, etc. If we examine the distribution of companies by employee size, we see that in the mid-market, the ratio is 2:1 in favor of B2B. In the very large employee counts, the ratio is closer to 1:1. Here’s one hypothesis. There are more consumer companies that enjoy monopoly dynamics or economies of scale through brand. These winner-take-more dynamics skew the distribution at the top end of the spectrum more in favor of B2C. And the mid-market has a greater share of B2B as a consequence. If your company sells a product whose value doesn’t change as a function of B2B vs B2C, and both markets are equally addressable, the analysis suggests that your sales team should likely be 1.6:1 or 2:1 depending on the customer size you target and the the relative price points you can command in each segment. What is yours today?

Here are my 5 predictions for 2020. The direct listing becomes the standard way for startups to go public in 2020. The idea has been proven by Slack and Spotify, and many others will follow. Most startups at IPO have plenty of cash and don’t need to raise more in the public markets. The direct listing enables them to go public without raising capital. The M&A market continues to surge. Software M&A in 2019 reached about $170B up from $136B in 2018, up 25%. With SaaS penetration roughly 20-30% by our estimates, there’s several hundred billion in market cap to be created in the next few years. And incumbents desire as much of that as possible for themselves. I’ll guess a 15% increase from here or about $200B. Distributed becomes the norm. Most startups will be distributed (have several offices) before they reach 50 employees. Across our portfolio, we’re seeing this. High costs of living plus modern collaboration tools, changing preferences, and startup success in other geographies push this trend into the mainstream. Public software multiples remain at elevated levels. I think the median software multiple remains around 9x, and the bull market continues. The monetary policy of low interest rates and potential liquidity injection into the repo market by the Fed bolsters the public markets and offsets volatility from politics. Fundraising environment remains strong. First Round published their annual report . In it, 65% of founders believe the fundraising market in 2020 will present more challenges than 2019. I’ll take the opposite perspective. The IPO window will be open and the list of blockbuster companies is long. If a few of those IPOs do well, greed will sustain market valuations. Here are my 2019 predictions and my analysis of them. I count 2.5 wrong and 3.5 correct. The M&A market slows meaningfully. Dead wrong. The M&A market increased by 25% and the multiples were strong. PE played less of role than 2018, when they spent 50% of the dollars, and strategics stepped up to fill the void, and then some. The IPO market remains open . Correct. The IPO market was open. It rewarded companies with better gross margins (typically above 50%). Uber, Zoom, Pinterest, PagerDuty, Crowdstrike, Slack, and many others made a great list. Blockchain technology finds its second killer application. Miss. BTC/USD prices are down 30% at least. The ecosystem continues to innovate but the second killer app (currency being the first), hasn’t yet been found. The Monoclouds continue to challenge the open source ecosystem by offering hosted services of popular projects. Right on. Look no further than AWS Re:Invent where Amazon announced an entire suite of Machine Learning tools that compete with nearly every player in the ecosystem in every level of the stack. Startups begin to siphon off important but underserved segments of SaaS incumbent’s customer bases. True but hard to judge. Data engineering is the new Customer Success. Data engineering became an important movement in 2019, continuing the evolution from 2018 and beyond. There are podcasts about it, and it’s more recognized as a discipline.

It’s been an incredible year and one I’m grateful for. The most gratifying thing writing this blog is the feedback from readers who say the content is useful. That’s the goal. Thank you for making this so much fun and deeply rewarding. These are the top posts of 2019 with some commentary and behind the scenes notes on each. 1.01^365 = 37.7 - The idea behind this post is that small, daily improvement leads to huge compounding gains. A 1% daily improvement yields a 37x improvement in a year! Setting the Salesforce/Tableau Acquisition in Context - A wave of consolidation swept the BI industry. Salesforce bought Tableau. Google bought Looker for $2.7B and I was so lucky to have a front row seat. This article talked about the sizes of these acquisition relative to history. Mattermost’s $50M Series B - We are big believers in open source. We’ve invested in more than 15 open source companies over the last 15 years (eg, Hashicorp, Cockroach Labs, Dremio…). Less than 9 months after leading the A, Mattermost raised a large B to push forward open source chat and chatops. The 37% Rule: How to Decide When to Stop Wondering and Start Deciding : I read Algorithms to Live By, which was terrific. And then I listened to a podcast from the author who reminded me about this simple math principle that gives me confidence about making quick decisions. What a Valuation Implies About a Business : I’m curious about the way different investors value different businesses. And for a long time, I wondered how to translate the valuation multiples of a company into a more tangible concept. This is my mental model. A Clever Hack to Reading More Books : There’s so much knowledge in books, and as a society we’re spending less and less time with books . It’s a format that is in slow decline .  One way of reading more books is to reduce the cost of them. Here’s my hack to do exactly that! The SaaS Valuation Environment in Mid-2019 : 2019 saw the highest valuation environment for SaaS companies for the last 15 years. This chart documented the rise from about a 3.3x EV/forward rev to a 9.5x. A few months later, the market would hit 10.5x forward. Now we’ve regressed a bit, which is good thing. Observations from the Enterprise Tech 30 List - Wing.vc ran a coaches poll of the most promising startups. I broke down the buyers, the layers of the stack they belong to, and the customer size segment to see if patterns exist. Redpoint invested in 8 of the 30, more than any other venture firm. A Random Walk Down Sand Hill Road - Mental models are supremely powerful. There’s a book called The Model Thinker that delves deep into the topic, showing you the math of why you should play basketball faster if you shoot better; and the implications of different types of social networks. The Fundraising Environment in 2019 - Three Major Shifts - At the beginning of the year, the ICO was a thing, and that’s gone for now. But the broader trend is financial products aren’t discrete any more. They are continuous. And the monikers no longer carry meaning. A $7m round might be a seed, a series A or a Series B. Time to jettison the labels and just use the numbers. Before You Raise a Round of Funding, Ask Yourself This Question - Make sure you do plan your options grants for key hires and employees before raising a round of capital. Why Product Innovation Slows After the Series A - The transition from finding product market fit to scaling has real costs, and they appear in the product innovation cadence. That Will Never Work - The history of Netflix is a fascinating adventure. Marc Randolph, the founder who is also part of Looker’s board, narrates the wild ride. Why Churn Rates Can Spike When Your SaaS Startup Experiences Hypergrowth - An important nuance when evaluating churn for your company. The Benefits of and Questions Facing Remote and Distributed Startups - One major trend for 2019 and for 2020 is the rise of distributed companies. I explored the pros and cons of this corporate structure. Regardless of the cons, distributed teams are an inexorable force in startupland, analogous to globalization in the the broader economy.

In November, two spectacles occurred. The first is Dreamforce, Salesforce’s annual event and the largest software conference in the world. The second is Elon Musk announcing the Tesla Cybertruck. Benioff and Musk use these events strategically. They engender an operational cadence to Salesforce and Tesla. There’s no feeling like launch day. It’s the day you reveal to the world the sumtotal of your team’s efforts for weeks or months. That’s how I felt as a PM - a huge sense of urgency, anxiety and motivation. I imagine this is how every founder fats on the eve of demo day. Launch day requires collaboration across teams. Marketing must prepare the story and materials. PR readies articles and interviews. Engineering builds the product. SRE ensures it stays up. Legal must sign off. Sales and support prepare their pitches. Success requires massive cross-functional collaboration. Product launches at Dreamforce and Tesla press days create an operational cadence and alignment because the entire business must be ready on a particular day. Dazzling annual launches are one tactic. At the other end of the spectrum are monthly releases. One well known SaaS unicorn focused itself on monthly product launches. The first Tuesday of every month, they launched a new product or feature. The company sustained this cadence for two years. The benefits of such a strategy were many. First, the company sustained a torrid pace of product development for a long time achieving more than most thought possible. Second, the market perceived the startup as fast moving and innovative. In a competitive market, they leapt from a distant second to a tie. Third, the strategy instilled anxiety within the competition. What might launch this month? Fourth, the company works as a unit because all focus on this goal. It was a rallying cry. There are critiques of this method. Sustain a frenetic cadence for too long, employees burnout. Teams may launch products that don’t exist (Salesforce Einstein) or aren’t ready (unbreakable windows that shatter). But, the product launch can be a powerful management technique to align and accelerate teams.

Our portfolio company Chorus.ai released the State of Conversational Intelligence 2020 . The report uses data from 5m sales and customer calls to benchmark sales team performance. There’s lots of great data in the report. Some of the data reaffirms rules of thumb. For example, the typical win rate of a sales qualified lead is 19%. Other data points are surprising. For example, the average SDR dials 106 people to schedule one meeting. And the typical sales manager reviews only 8% of calls, but the best managers spend much more. The report covers outbound, inbound and account executive behaviors throughout the sales process, from the very first touch to the characteristics of great late stage calls. We’ve also collected data on customer success and the right ways to handle the critical transition from sales to customer success after a customer signs. If you’re curious about how your team stacks up relative to others, or want to read about the best practices for sales and customer success teams, it’s worth a read.

Last week’s post on The Most Frequent Mishire in Startups generated the most comments on a post this year. In particular, it was this section. Though the startup may have achieved product market fit, the company may not understand the fit. Who is using the product and why? How does the buyer journey evolve with time? How do buyers describe the product amongst each other? Few early stage companies can answer those questions accurately. Why is this? Early in the life of a business, the product manager (often a founder) plays both the role of the PM and the PMM. Over time, the startup’s growth demands a more specialized role. Many times, the PM builds the product as quickly as possible to establish product/market fit. In contrast, the PMM answers critical questions about the company, product and market to ensure the product sells. What are these critical questions? I found an excellent list in Kotler on Marketing that I adapted for startups. How many of these questions can you answer about your business? What is our company’s story? What is our pitch? Which market segment should we pursue? How do we differentiate our product from competition? What is the best way to assure a successful new product launch? How should we respond when customers ask for discounts? How much customization do we offer? How can we reduce or maintain cost of customer acquisition? How can we retain our customers for longer? Which of our customers are the most important? What are the best ways to improve salesforce productivity? What are our payback periods on each of our marketing efforts? How can the business develop multiple channels of customer acquisition and avoid channel conflict? How can we orient the entire business to be more customer oriented? These questions are also excellent interviewing questions. When evaluating candidates, use structured interviews and work projects to maximize chances of  success. Structured interviews are the best predictive factor of job success with 28% correlation. Work projects, (a presentation that answers a key question about the business like a 60/90/120 day plan) explain 26% of variance. The unstructured interview (let’s have a conversation!) correlates at 14%. See Laszlo Bock’s Work Rules for a deeper dive into these interviewing concepts. The role of the PMM may be one of the most frequently misunderstood in Startupland. But it’s worth understanding the role and finding a great one. PMMs answers some of the thorniest questions about a business and so that everyone can work more efficiently. With the answers to the questions above, a startup can scale with greater success by eliminating unnecessary experimentation.

The most frequent mishire in startups is the first head of marketing. Many different disciplines fall under marketing’s purview. The question facing founders recruiting marketers is: which is the most important to prioritize? Marketing expertise falls into three segments: product marketing, demand generation, and brand marketing. Each of these kinds of marketers have critical skills for a startup. But the reason many marketing hires fail is the business doesn’t hire the right expertise at the right time. Let’s describe each: Product marketing is critical but the least well understood. Product marketers are responsible for bringing a product to market. What does that mean? Hubspot listed the 7 steps of product marketing in a recent post, and it’s a terrific summary. PMMs (product marketing managers) research the customer, craft the story of the product, produce content that relates the story, develop the launch plan for the product, coordinate the launch, engage the users and analysts, and product content to enable sales to sell. Demand generation marketers serve a different role. Demand generation marketers acquire leads using a portfolio of techniques. They use software and tools to find potential buyers. This acquisition portfolio spans search, advertising, social media, events, podcasts, ebooks, outbound calling, and many other techniques. Product marketers’ research informs the personas and the stories that demand generators employ to attract prospective customers. Brand marketers are the third type of marketer who develops the market’s awareness of a company. A brand is a huge strategic asset that can represent a huge fraction of a company’s value ; nearly half of Coca-Cola’s value is its brand. The market leader or the category creator often captures the majority of the market value. And this a reinforcing effect, a flywheel. The more a company is recognized as a leader, the more business it should garner. Which should you hire first? Many founders seek a demand generation marketer. After achieving product market fit, it’s a natural time to scale lead generation. But over the past decade or so, I’ve found hiring a product marketer first leads to more consistent success. Why is this? Though the startup may have achieved product market fit, the company may not understand the fit. Who is using the product and why? How does the buyer journey evolve with time? How do buyers describe the product amongst each other? Few early stage companies can answer those questions accurately. Establishing this foundation enables the company to determine which messages to proclaim and which customers to pursue. Having this framework aligns the business and typically increases marketing efficiency because campaigns are well targeted and resonate better. Demand generation and brand marketers will reap the benefits of this work. So will the rest of the business because it deeply understands its customers.

A few weeks ago, we were fortunate to welcome Nick Mehta, CEO of Gainsight to SaaS Office Hours. I learned a lot from the session about how customer success has evolved over the last 5 to 10 years. Here are my notes from the session. The discipline of customer success varies widely depending on price point. At the lower price points, some organizations combine the role of an account manager and the customer success person into a CSAM (customer success account manager). These CSAMs perform high-volume account management and customer success typically through email and other forms of broad campaigns to drive retention and upsell. In the midmarket, it’s not uncommon to see combinations of account managers and customer success managers. This is the “classic” version of customer success most of us picture when we talk about the concept. In the enterprise, things change again. Customer success teams may also be working with solutions architects and customer support teams. The larger the contract value, the more common it is for sales teams to own expansion and for sales to be the primary contact, directing a team of people focused on customer success. Ultimately, the customer success strategy and organizational structure must be designed to reflect the possibility of upsell. There are some products that are sold into customer segments where there simply is no possibility of upsell. In this case, account management makes the most sense. In other cases, land and expand is the predominant go to market strategy and expansions are worth significantly more than the initial contract. In these scenarios, investing in larger post sales teams drives account growth. There are many organizational structures. Some companies structure the CS teams and sales teams in an identical fashion. Others stratify their organizations by price point because the customer success tactics vary by ACV. As mentioned above, for low ACVs customer success managers may use broad marketing campaigns. At the enterprise, where named accounts are common, an individual customer success manager or customer success team may be responsible for a Fortune 500 or fraction thereof. Compensation strategies for customer success are evolving to include a larger fraction of performance compensation. It’s not uncommon to see a 75/25 or 70/30 split between base and commission for upsells, or sometimes more. The greater the opportunity to upsell account, the greater the likelihood of performance-based compensation. There are a lot of different benchmarks for customer success performance. I’ve written about that dollar retention and ARR under management per customer success manager. Nick mentioned percent of ARR at scale spent on customer success. At the early stages, this spend might be as high as 15-20%. It declines over time to about 10% in the growth stage and then 4-5% at IPO stage or later. It’s clear CS is evolving as each company implements customer success strategies in ways to benefit their business. And it was kind of Nick to share his perspective with us. Thanks, Nick!

Next week, on November 14, Redpoint will host Office Hours with Anthony Kennada to talk about category creation. In the SaaS world, many businesses talk about creating new categories. To achieve this is rare, and it’s incredibly challenging to do. Anthony was a key part of the team at Gainsight that created the category that has just published a book on the topic called Category Creation , that we will talk about. Anthony will share his perspectives on how to create a brand, how to identify a market where category can be created, the basic game plan for applying it to your business, and how to create a movement. Office Hours are hour long fireside chats with a speaker. We host them at our office in San Francisco and we gather questions from a small audience of about 30-40 people in a closed door format.  The session is meant to be interactive and provide close access to SaaS luminaries. Apply to attend these office hours here. Demand for these events often exceeds our hosting capacity, so we will email confirmations five days before the event. Reminder: these events are all off the record. Please register if you can attend in person.

There’s no doubt we’re in the founder-CEO era of startups. Ten or twenty years ago, hiring a professional CEO to run a business was de rigeur. But today, it’s less and less common. At the seed stage, nearly all CEOs are founders. No surprise there since the company is so young. But at the Series D, founder CEOs helm approximately 70% of venture backed startups in the Bay Area. This is up from 53% in 2014. This share has increased by a third in five years. In fact, across Series A, B, C, and D, founders persist as CEOs more frequently. There are a few reasons to explain this trend. First, Startupland has a culture of sharing knowledge. As we all learn more about startups, founder sophistication increases with time. Networks are stronger, richer and larger and more concepts are better understood. In SaaS, key performance metrics and benchmarks have been established. Management techniques have formalized. Second, the increasing competition amongst venture capitalists has changed the power dynamic in between founders and investors. With more competition, VCs often differentiate on founder friendliness and changing CEOs is often perceived as founder unfriendly. We’ve also seen the rise of founder shares with greater voting power. This construct empowers founders to retain the CEO title much longer up to IPO and potentially through it. It’s not to say that supervoting shares render CEOs invincible. We’ve witnessed some notable cases of founders with super-voting shares ousted from their perch (WeWork and Uber among others). But certainly, they play a role in founder CEO longevity. Third, an executive talent shortage may play a role. Hiring a CEO to lead a business may be a more challenging endeavour than a few years ago because of the supply/demand imbalance market. Fourth, companies may be raising capital more quickly, so there is less time beween rounds. We’ve seen this across our portfolio companies. What we can’t see from this data is the true tenure of CEOs and how they have changed over time. Founder CEOs have created some of the largest technology companies. Oracle, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Atlassian, Google, and many other businesses have been built with the founder as CEO. In some cases, the path has been straightforward. In others, a bit more circuitous, but the founder as CEO is a powerful thing. Founders engender a moral imperative from their teams that a hired CEO may never replicate. Of course, there are circumstances where a CEO change makes sense for the business, whether to learn from a mentor  directly, jettison some responsibilities, pursue other interests inside or outside the company, or any other number of reasons. In any case, there’s no debating the secular trend of founder CEOs.

A few weeks ago, I installed Windows on my Mac using BootCamp. BootCamp allows you to have both operating systems on your computer at the same time and choose the one you want to use when.  I was curious about Windows. So I installed it and tried to use it for a few days. Here are my impressions. Just as background, I’ve been on a Mac since I was seven and I last worked on a Windows machine in 2004. Pros of Windows Speed: the operating system is much faster than Mac. Starting the computer takes less time. Logging in after you shut the machine is instantaneous. Even websites load much faster.  I was surprised. The more I use it, the more noticeable the speed delta is to the Mac. Battery life:  I can last 4 to 5 hours on my MacBook Pro running Mac OS, but I can get 6 to 8 hours with Windows.  I’m not quite sure why this is. The applications I use on Windows are the same. Applications: There is a universe of applications that I couldn’t access before. Things like Excel plug-ins which many data providers use. They are powerful, fast and easy. to help a lot when I’m gathering data. Dictation: Dragon dictation software performs miles better on Windows. Dictation is better integrated into the operating system. It’s faster and more accurate. The Mac version of Dragon is buggy, and no longer supported by Nuance. I presume  because Apple has integrated into their operating system. The iPad version of VoiceOver (Apple’s brand name for dictation) shines. The desktop version is unusable: it maxes out the CPU and simply doesn’t work. Linux kernel: like the Mac, Windows now has a native Linux kernel, which makes it feel like a programmer’s machine. With VS Code (Microsoft’s development environment), and you have a powerful combination. Cons of Windows Feels like a TV:  every time I click the start menu on Windows, I see advertisements for Mickey Mouse or Xbox gaming.  For business machine, it feels out of place. It also makes me wonder how much of my behavioral data is used for content targeting. Keyboard shortcuts:  Getting used to a different keyboard layout is tough. Instead of the command key, the control key is the magic one for shortcuts. I tried remapping them using an open source tool and editing the registry. I had forgotten about the registry and the run tool in Windows. But this didn’t work. there’s also nothing like an Alfred App (which I find indispensable on the Mac). There are few alternatives, but none of them work as well. Scrolling: remember when Mac switched scrolling directions on the trackpad?  It took a while to get used to. Windows defaults to the old way, scrolling by dragging down. Also, there’s no inertial scrolling, where you drag down quickly and the page scrolls down but slows down with time. The mouse seems to work differently for some reason that isn’t intuitive. Old and new: The operating system has a Jekyll and Hyde presentation layer. Sometimes it is beautiful, but every once in a while you run into a dialogue that must have been written in 1993. Drivers:  Rediscovering Drivers and DLLs were an unwelcome return to the past. These files complexify everything and I remember hours Googling to find the right one to connect a hard drive or printer. Overall, they are far more equal than I would have guessed. This was a huge surprise. Each OS has its own trade-offs, but I can now could imagine using both. In fact, I do. I switch between operating systems depending on the kind of work I’m doing and whether or not I’m traveling.

In January, we welcomed Travis Bryant to join Redpoint as an Executive-in-Residence. Nine months later, we are welcoming him again as our first Partner of Founder Experience.
Travis has always been one to think about ways to change the game. He excelled during his time at Salesforce and helped Optimizely grow to great heights from very early days as the first executive hire. Throughout his many successes, he’s always looking to innovate. When we first met, he told me the Chief Revenue Officer title made no sense to him. “Why would you tell your customer that the most important thing to you is the revenue they provide you?” he asked rhetorically. Instead, he said, “the title should be Chief Customer Officer since the customer should always be the first priority.” Over the last 10 years, venture capitalism has changed quite a bit. Venture capitalists must provide better service to their founders and ecosystem. Travis is joining Redpoint to do exactly that, and it starts with the right title: Founder Experience.
At Redpoint, we care deeply about founders. Many of us have been founders and more of us operators. We understand and empathize with the rollercoaster of experiences and situations that can change emotions from complete euphoria to total despair within just a few hours. It’s a hard journey. But we aim to support our founders and ecosystem throughout it - to be the first call in both cases. And on that call, channel a little Rudyard Kipling: “If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster; And treat those two impostors just the same…” We host events to educate and share wisdom. We publish blogs and landscapes to disseminate knowledge. We deploy capital to help companies grow. All of it is in service of this magical ecosystem that we are privileged to be a part of. Investing in Founder Experience is the next important step in that effort. Over the next few quarters and beyond, we will be iterating on our efforts to support the founder journey. From the time before a founder has heard of Redpoint, to the first time hearing about the firm, to their first interactions, to the investment process, all the way through the ultimate conclusion of their effort and beyond. We’re thrilled to welcome someone of Travis’ caliber into a key role at Redpoint, and we’re keen to see what he has in store for delivering a world-class Founder Experience.

Today is the anniversary of Spotify IPO, which was the first direct listing of a technology company. It was championed by Barry McCarthy, the former CFO of Netflix and the current CFO of Spotify. Since then, Slack has also listed directly. And the combination of these two events has created a groundswell for more of them. In the past few months and quarters, I’ve been learning as much as I can about this topic. Here are my notes and sources. Before we start, let me define four terms. A primary round occurs when a startup creates new shares and sells those to an investor. A secondary round occurs when an existing shareholder sells their shares to a new investor. An IPO is a primary round that occurs in the stock market when a company trades for the first time. A direct listing is a secondary round that occurs in the stock market when a company trades for the first time. An IPO pop is a negative. If a company pops by 30 or 40% on their IPO, this means it has been mispriced. Imagine I sell you a doughnut for a dollar. Then you turn around and immediately sell it to the person sitting next to you for a $1.40. Would you feel excited that your doughnut is now worth more? No. You should feel fleeced. This is exactly the same dynamic for a pop at IPO, but instead of doughnuts, we are talking about shares and instead of dollars, we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. The IPO process isn’t computerized. How does the stock market start every day? There is a computer system that matches buyers of stock with sellers of stock. They each specify the amount and the price at which they are willing to buy or sell. And at the open, or quickly after, the current market price of that stock is established by algorithms. In a classic IPO, this process is done by hand which creates lots of inefficiency.  And, typically all of the IPO is allocated amongst a group of 10 large institutional investors, which reinforces this inefficiency. Computers are much better at making markets than humans. During the IPO process, bankers target 10-20x oversubscription. When a company goes public, it goes on a roadshow. It’s very similar to raising capital in any other round. after briefing different investors, each investor submits a demand curve of sort:their preference of buying a certain number of shares at a certain price. This goes into a book (an Excel spreadsheet today). The book contains the total demand for the offering. In many IPOs, bankers advise startups to achieve 10-20x oversubscription, in order to get that pop. On one hand, that sounds pretty compelling because there’s so much demand. On the other hand, this means the company is  under pricing itself. Imagine you had a doughnut and you have 20 people willing to bid on it at a dollar. Would you stop there, or would you start auctioning it to the highest bidder? The role of the IPO is changing. It used to be that the only way to raise $100 million was through an IPO.  the private capital markets were not large enough to support these kinds of round sizes. In the last 15 years, the private capital markets have become much larger and it’s a common occurrence to read about $100M or $500M financings or even billion-dollar financings. So the role of the IPO must change. It’s no longer about raising capital. It instead it is about providing liquidity to investors and employees. The direct listing is a new financial product for startups  addresses many of these issues. Direct listings provide ways for companies to price themselves more accurately using algorithms, reduce banker fees, and only raise the capital they need without suffering excess dilution. The direct listing is different in a few important ways. First, there is no lockup. In a classic IPO, insiders are restricted from selling for the first 180 days, in order to prevent negative pressure on the stock price. In a direct listing, they can sell immediately.  Some speculate this is the reason for the decline in the share prices at Slack and Spotify since their IPOs. Second, in a classic IPO, perhaps 15% of all outstanding shares might trade. This is called the float. In a direct listing, all of the shares are available to trade. Each holder of shares including employees determines at a price they’re willing to sell. Because the float is larger, institutional investors may be happier with direct listings because they can buy much larger positions in names they are excited about. Whereas, in a classic IPO, they might be able to buy $5M of allocation, in a direct listing, they could buy hundreds of millions. Third, instead of a roadshow, companies host investor days, which are online webinars that brief any number of people. It might be hundreds or thousands were millions of people who might be interested in the direct listing. This means you can buy shares in the direct listing on the same basis as a big bank or hedge fund, which isn’t the case in the classic IPO. Fourth, the dynamics of the investment bank change because the research department has less privileged access to the business than they would have with the classic IPO. In a classic IPO,  the startup briefs a small number of investors, and the analysts at the bank have terrific access to the management team. The analyst then summarize this research and share with everybody. But with an investor day, the analysts lose this access and the value of the research diminishes. The direct listing is an important innovation for startups. The new financial product for taking businesses public that recognizes the important changes in the private capital markets. We are going to see many more of these direct listings. Importantly, they will benefit not only the employees of the startups who will capture more of the value created, but also retail investors who will be able to access IPOs; something they haven’t been able to because of the old structure.

Dr. Daniel Kahneman features on the latest Farnam Street podcast and it’s a surprising episode. Kahneman wrote Thinking Fast and Slow . I admire Kahneman a great deal. Not for his Nobel or for his work, which are both impressive, but for his humility. Some of the key tenets of Kahneman’s work in his famous book were disproved. And he owned up to it , both in print and on the podcast. That’s the hallmark of someone with great integrity, and it’s a sign to trust someone more. So I listened to his podcast with great interest. Kahneman discussed the ways to make better decisions. He recommends delaying your intuition and breaking down a decision process into smaller pieces. Suppose you are interviewing executives for a VP role. Ahead of time, the hiring team creates a rubric detailing a few key dimensions, maybe five or six. Cultural fit, intelligence, domain expertise, ability to recruit and management style, hypothetically. The hiring committee interviews the candidate and then reassembles to debrief. Most of the time, we run unstructured meetings. Kahneman recommends structuring the agenda by dimension. Everyone discusses the first parameter and scores her on cultural fit. Once that’s done, the group moves onto intelligence. Everyone scores the candidate, and onto the next one. At the end, the group reviews the score matrix and decides. In this way, everyone delays their intuition and thinks more deeply about the decision. This is a structured interview, which is three times better at predicting outcomes than an unstructured interview . Another way of breaking down decision is the Fermi Process, named for Enrico Fermi , another Nobel laureate, father of the atomic bomb. Fermi was a terrific estimator. He famously estimated the power of the atomic bomb to within an order of magnitude by dropping leaves of paper during the detonation of a test bomb. The Fermi Process or Fermization, as Tetlock called it in a great book called Superforecasters , is about breaking down a problem into smaller parts. Then estimate each of the subcomponents and then calculate the answer. How many piano tuners exist in Chicago? Can you estimate it? The answer is at the bottom of this post. This idea of breaking down predictions and forecasts into smaller bits has merit and has been proven across several different fields. It’s worth considering as a tool the next time you need to decide on a complex topic. As Kahneman says, the best decisions are made by algorithms and the closer we can get to structured decisions, the more we can supress bias. The podcast has several other interesting jaunts on different topics in work psychology. But the thing that I admire most about the author is his integrity. It’s rare to see a man of such prominence admit fallibility. It’s a trait to admire and emulate. *Chicago has about 290 piano tuners. See this explanation

We are very excited about open source software. Open source is a powerful distribution mechanism to get software and people’s hands early and easily. In an era where SaaS customer acquisition cost increases monotonically , open source can be a powerful antidote. The other area that we are spending time in is open source at the application tier. Mattermost is our latest investment there, and we continue to look for others. They tend to be very capital efficient, fast growing businesses that can be quite disruptive. User experience has never been something that open source projects are known for. If you’ve used GIMP or OpenOffice or other tools, you know that the user interfaces are probably designed by the engineers who built the tools, which are great initial iterations. But the polish doesn’t compare to close source alternatives. One of the questions I’ve been curious about is why designers don’t participate as actively within the open source ecosystem as engineers. Googling, I found lots of different reasons. But this answer on StackExchange summarizes all them well. The quick synopsis: Open source projects parallelize tasks across lots of people and decisions are made by committee. Designers tend to work in much smaller teams. [Parallelization] becomes design by committee and the final product can easily become an inconsistent mess that no individual who contributed to it will want in their portfolio The best design teams establish design standards for products. Many innovative companies now have design operations teams that do this is a full-time job. No open-source project to my knowledge has a similar idea. Open source projects revolve around Github. Most designers have little to no knowledge/experience using this workflow. I’ve found other arguments too: Developer culture praises open source. Designer culture seems to be vehemently opposed to free spec work. link and, that designers contribute but in a different way: The analogous [open source contributions] for graphics design would be something like textures & Photoshop filters. Or icon packs. Or fonts. Which you can find lots of for free (sometimes even with useful licensing attached). link Bridging the gap between design and engineering in open source software is a huge opportunity. There are lots of obstacles to overcome: workflow, structure, appropriate recognition, and perhaps some cultural change. But if we are able to overcome it, the amount of creativity we could unlock could be enormous. It could catalyze a wave of increasingly beautiful open-source software. If you have interest or are passionate about this topic, please let me know. I’d love to get in touch with you

We’ve all seen the data on the average increases in round sizes over the last four or five years. Startups are able to raise larger early rounds because of the financial environment. One way of thinking about the early-stage fundraising market is as a collection of financial products. In 2008, there was a $5M series A product and a $10M series B product. Those were the most popular. As I’ve written about before, there’s now a continuum of financial products available to startups at the early stage . The relative market share of each of these financial products has whipsawed in four years. The chart above shows the share of the market of each financial product by count. The top left chart shows a $1M round had about 41% market share in 2010;  that grew to about 54% in 2014; now it has fallen to 35%. The $3M round has suffered a similar loss of share. The $5M round declined during that same time. But is now at the same level it was in 2010. But something changed. In 2010, it was very likely that a business raised a $1M round before raising a $3-5M dollar round. Today, the first institutional round of capital is that $3-5M in 54% of cases, up from 39% in 2014. Looking at the second row, we see that larger round sizes, those above $10M, all follow the same geometric curve since 2014.  They are much more popular than they used to be. Just how much more popular? The bar chart above shows the change in share of round sizes by count over the same time frame. $1M rounds are 16% less common. Meanwhile, $20M rounds are 80% more common. $15M rounds are 64% more common. These numbers would be more extreme if benchmarked to 2014. In an economy with a very low cost of capital, these trends are to be expected. The surprising part is the speed and magnitude of the shift. If we examine the same market share trends with dollars instead of count, we see slightly different picture. $1M rounds have lost 51% of their market share since 2010 in dollars. If you’re a founder and can raise more capital for the same dilution, why wouldn’t you? If you’re raising a first round, at this point, the odds that your round will be $1M are roughly equal to a $3-5M round.

In a recent interview, Sid Sijbrandij, the founder of Gitlab observed something about remote teams that I think is absolutely true. I’ve seen it in many of the remote/distributed companies we work with. He said: Remote forces you to do the things you should be doing any way earlier and better As companies scale, they need to develop infrastructure to successfully manage and coordinate large numbers of people. But in the early days, by virtue of being close to each other physically, it’s easier to delay some of these investments. A quick hallway meeting of a few key stakeholders might be all it takes to commit to a strategic change. A last-minute all hands roused through word-of-mouth may be the prelude to a fundraising announcement. For a business that exists somewhere on the distributed-to-remote continuum these options don’t exist, or at least they are significantly harder.  These kind of communications are just as necessary within remote or distributed teams, but they require more planning, more foresight in order to be successful. This is often why we see remote and distributed companies invest in human resources functions earlier on. consequently, these businesses articulate their values sooner. They are more deliberate about their internal communication at far younger stages. They typically run meetings in more structured and formal ways. Each of these disciplines eventually emerge within larger companies as they sprout new offices. But for remote and distributed companies, these investments must be made often in the very earliest days. And this is a really good thing. It used to be that we would point to the largest companies as the epitome of managerial excellence. You would go to an IBM training program. I went through the Google APM program. At that scale of tens or hundreds of thousands of employees,  management discipline and excellence is a prerequisite to operating the business. It’s the only way to align large numbers of people. The difference today is that some very early stage companies are bringing in these disciplines from the outset, because of the demands of remote work. And this is a wonderful thing, because this investment will compound over the life of the business.

Over the weekend, there was quite a bit of press about the challenged state of startup IPOs this year. I was curious about the real trends in share prices, so I gathered the data on some of the more salient IPOs. The chart above shows 11 IPOs at different points in their life cycles. The leftmost column is the price of the shares at IPO, followed by the share price on the first day close, followed by Friday’s price. There are all kinds of patterns in the data. Zoom and Pinterest have positive trajectories. The first day close is higher than the IPO price, and today’s price is higher still. You could argue that these shares were mispriced at the IPO -  but that’s a topic for another post. Companies like Uber, SmileDirectClub, Peloton and Lyft have the opposite pattern. The IPO price is the highest share price; first day close is lower; and today’s price is lower still. An interesting correlation: all of these companies are consumer businesses with lower gross margins. A third category to see a pop after the first day of trading, followed by some compression. CrowdStrike, DataDog, Dynatrace, PagerDuty and Slack. So, there isn’t one story here. Each company is trading differently depending on the characteristics of that business. A negatively-biased story might focus on the fact that most 2019 IPOs trade below their first day close price. The chart above shows the delta between the current price of the stock and the first close price. Only two have appreciated. Another perspective would compare current stock prices to the IPO price, which presents a far more balanced case with about half of the names appreciating. This data suggests that the IPO market in 2019 has been characterized by very aggressive price increases on the first day of trading, which deflate over time. This deflation may have several causes. First, it’s hard not to cite the changing public market sentiment in the recent correction in valuations/forward multiples. Second,  large holders of these shares may be selling big blocks of shares in these companies, depressing prices as lock-ups expire (or don’t exist in the case of a direct listing). As the sentiments in the markets shift, they will impact startup valuations. And though the IPO window has been open for 2019, some of this data suggests investor demand may not be as exuberant as it was a few months ago, when growth was prized above all.

I’ve been searching for a great history of the venture capital industry since before I joined Redpoint. There are a handful of books that are pretty good. Done Deals. eBoys. Creative Capital. But there’s a great one called VC by Tom Nicholas. Nicholas traces the history of the venture capital industry back to whaling. They weren’t called venture capitalists back then, but they serve the same role. Men would broker relationships between wealthy individuals and adventuresome captains. Capital met ambition, and crew set sail for years at a time in search of whale oil and balene, the flexible bone whales use to harvest krill from the ocean. Some would return with huge catches, fetching incredible sums of money back at shore, and netting the investors handsome profits. Others returned empty-handed after years at sea. Still others lost their lives in the pursuit of white whales. Understanding the origins of the industry was interesting. But more fascinating still were the descriptions of the venture capital   industry in the 1980s. Creative Capital did a great job explaining the history of American Research & Development, what many call the first venture-capital firm started by Georges Doriot. But there was an era in the 80s through the mid-90s that is reminiscent of the dot com era that I knew nothing of. In 1983, there were 173 venture backed technology IPOs. Almost 1 each working day. Then there are a lot of other details in this book. For example, in 1996, Kleiner Perkins invested $8 million for a 13% stake in Amazon, a surprisingly low ownership stake for the first institutional round in a company. Or talk of the pacing of venture funds in the dot com era. Typically most venture firms raise funds for ten year periods, but invest them over two or three. In the late 1990s, one firm invested $600 million in 12 months and another deployed their entire fund in 9. And if you want to know which venture firm created the archetype of limited partners, associates, diligence processes, Monday partner meetings and deal memos, you’ll have to read the book. Here are a few hints: this firm was started with an initial investment from T. Rowe Price, and one of the founders was a lieutenant of Georges Doriot at ARD. In fact, it was Doriot who named this firm.

I’ve gotten to know Marc Randolph as a fellow board member at Looker. Marc has helped many companies get off the ground, but the most famous is Netflix. Marc founded the business and served as its first CEO until Reed Hastings took the helm in 2003. In That Will Never Work , Marc recounts the early days of the $130B market cap company first started in Santa Cruz and it’s a remarkable story. One in which Redpoint partner Tim Haley has a cameo (Tim led the Series A.) The book starts out in a car with Marc and Reed commuting together, fighting the traffic on 101 to San Francisco and batting around ideas for new companies. There’s a familiar pattern to these conversations. Marc suggests the idea, and Reed identifies the flaws. Eventually, Marc and his team identify the concept that will become Netflix. I won’t spoil the details, because the story is riveting, and well worth reading. Marc writes about the origins of the culture of Netflix, one that is held in the highest regards to this day. He writes about the first CD sent through the mail to test if it would work and how he dropped off at the Santa Cruz post office. He brings you back to a time when DVD players were new, and no one had them; and when the movie studios preferred to sell DVDs rather than rent them. And to a time before streaming video. There’s also a really hilarious incident with a Bill Clinton DVD that Netflix sends out for two cents but many customer receive an unexpected surprise. The part that is the most unusual about this business history is the CEO transition. CEO transitions can be very difficult times in a company’s life and in a CEO/founder’s life. Each one has its own story, its own complications, its  own denouement. “Marc,” Reed started slowly, “I’ve been thinking a lot about the future. And I’m worried." He paused, trying to read my face. Then he pursed his lips, looking down at the screen like it was a set of cue cards, and continued. “I’m worried about us. Actually, I’m worried about you. About your judgment.” While the entire book is riveting, this is the chapter that I read and re-read. It may be the hardest moment in a founder’s life. You have founded the business; you’ve gotten off the ground; raised capital; achieved product market fit; are scaling; and then someone comes into your office and says words like these. I love the honesty and candor in this book. Marc writes clearly about the challenges he faced as a founder and CEO, which takes incredible strength. That Will Never Work is a great book to the annals of Silicon Valley lore.

Last week, SaaS stocks fell by about 18% on average. The chart above shows the most recent enterprise value to forward multiple for a basket of next-generation software companies. The red line is the value and the blue line is the median over the same time frame. As of Friday, the median forward multiple is 9.3x which is a 11% drop from the previous high of 10.5x. The current valuation level is still top decile across this time period, despite the drop. In other words, the valuation environment is still at elevated levels. Let’s look at individual names. Only four stocks have seen multiple expansion in the last 3 months. The median drop is 19% over that time. ZScaler and 2U saw their multiples halve. PagerDuty is not far behind. in other words, this is a broad movement. If we look at the annual change of the multiple, the picture is a bit more balanced. But still we see a 10% median drop. Which companies were most affected?  The ones growing the fastest. In fact, revenue growth is correlated with margin compression at an R^2 of 0.596. This means that 60% of the margin compression is explained by revenue growth. In other words, public market investors decided to sell fastest growing companies, deciding the prices were too expensive. It’s natural that in times of economic uncertainty and questions about both the interest-rate environment and the economy, investors cycle out of the fastest growing stocks in search of something perhaps a bit more conservative. We have seen these kinds of dips in the past. The worst of them was in February 2016 when multiples fell by approximately 60%. This correction, at least so far, is much milder. It is reminiscent of the correction in December 2018 - and smaller so far. The bottom line for startups is that the market continues to price next-generation software companies at close to all time premiums, even with the recent vacillations.

Selling based on ROI (return-on-investment) sounds great. A salesperson lays out an iron-clad case for how the customer will make 5x or 6x or 10x their initial investment in a piece of software in three years or less. The champion will use ROI math to assuage upper management and procurement’s concerns. Or so the thinking goes. If we reflect on the most successful software companies, the very largest, very few sell based on ROI. What is the return on investment of a Salesforce or a Workday deployment? How do you calculate it? How does an AE defend it? Many times these ROI calculations assert unquestionable numbers. But most buyers approach these kinds of arguments with skepticism and even cynicism. Sometimes, they have been burned in the past making kind of arguments. Other times, buyers recognize that it is almost impossible to measure true return on investment. Switching costs are rarely accounted for in his calculations. Measuring increasing productivity is very difficult. Soft costs challenge the math. Most of the time, I advise companies to move away from ROI based pricing for all the reasons above. Second, a true ROI based sale, one in which startup captures a fraction of the incremental revenue, is a tough place to be. At the beginning, it seems to align incentives of the buyer and the vendor. The more revenue the buyer generates, the greater the fee for the vendor. But there are challenges in renewal. Every year, the buyer will ask you, “what have you done for me above and beyond the baseline we established last year?” The pricing model invites a deflationary renewal conversation. Unless you’re able to keep up a manic pace of product innovation. There are some cases where ROI based sales are effective. Software that eliminates entire teams or infrastructure products may slash costs. Hardware is often sold like this. The more the market is commodified, the more effective an ROI based sale is. But workflow software or collaboration software or other kinds of productivity based software typically are sold on the promise of the future; digital transformation; competitive advantage; or more intangible forms of efficiency. For those kinds of businesses, selling that promise is far more effective, more lucrative and more credible.

I’ve playing with a new mental model for early-stage startups: a pendulum. This pendulum oscillates between the limiting factors of the business at different stages. There are only two limiting factors in this mental model: product and go to market. At the moment a startup is founded, the business is product limited. You can’t do much without a product. After the company establishes product market fit, the pendulum swings to go-to-market. Now sales and marketing limits the company’s growth. Time to hire account executives and demand generation. As those teams begin to achieve lift, they exert stress on the product again. And the pendulum swings back. Proofs of concept and pilots are rocky. Customers ask for new features or bug fixes. The product and engineering teams’ ability to quickly satisfy these demands limits progress. Over some time, product and engineering bevel and chamfer the product’s sharp edges. Buoyed by this advance, sales and marketing accelerate their efforts and grow their teams. Regional vice presidents join the sales ranks. They will hire account executives in different regions. After a bit, these new AEs will begin closing business that requires more product work. SOC2 compliance, single sign-on integration, auditing, deeper security, etc. Often these are larger accounts. And the ball is passed back to product and engineering. Finally, the company has mastered both the product and the go to market for this first product. The cycle starts once again with a new product that might be built internally or acquired. One of the questions I started asking myself when working with companies at different stages is: where is the pendulum of this business? Is the limiting factor product or go to market? I find it is a helpful framing for prioritizing the efforts of the business and in particular the management team.

There’s a new debate about marketing efficiency recently, and it’s an important one in the era of product-led growth. If a startup has great net dollar retention (NDR), should it be willing to increase its customer acquisition spend proportionately? I remain a believer that months-to-repay is the best metric for measuring customer acquisition efficiency for a single reason. You know the answer immediately and accurately. With the annual contract you have in your hand and the amount of money you spent in sales and marketing to acquire a set number of customers in a period, you know exactly your MTR. Metrics like LTV/CAC or NDR-corrected CAC require predicting the future. Can a company that’s been around for 2 years accurately predict a 7 year customer lifetime? Can a startup with 2 annual cohorts predict NDR will remain at 140% for the foreseeable future? At the scale of a public company, with years of operating experience and a proven ability to predict performance, these other metrics may pose less risk to a business. But in the early days of a startup, when single customers or individual marketing/sales campaigns can inject meaningful variance, there’s much more risk. The risk is burning more cash than you might like. If your startup has a huge balance sheet, then it’s in a better position to take more risk and these metrics may suit you. You take more risk because if you assume a 160% NDR this year, and the cohorts regress to 140%, your MTR metric will suffer. In addition, you will burn more cash than you expected because you need more months to recoup your acquisition cost. Setting aside the philosophy, let’s look at the numbers. We know from the free trial survey that the top quartile NDR metrics are 120%+ and the top decile are 140%+. This means a customer cohort acquired last year is worth 140% their collective ARR this year, including customer losses and expansions. If your business has great account expansion, one could argue the company then consider the ACV to be 1.2x or 1.4x or 1.6x ACV. Then use that figure to determine whether the CAC is within an acceptable range. After all, buying more of these rapidly increasing annuities earlier means more ARR later. Let’s walk through a scenario. Assume a SaaS company with $20k ACV, 75% gross margin. The marketing team has set a months-to-repay threshold of 18 months, gross margin burdened. This means that the maximum CAC is $20k ACV x 75% gross margin x 18 months/12 months per year for $22.5k CAC maximum. NDR Table NDR Max CAC Effective MTR 100% 22,500 18 110% 24,750 20 120% 27,000 22 130% 29,250 23 140% 31,500 25 150% 33,750 27 160% 36,000 29 The table above shows the maximum CAC if you were to use the end of year ACV corrected for NDR scaling from the $22.5k we calculated above to $36k at 160% NDR in the Max CAC column. The Effective MTR column is the number of months this new CAC would take to repay if the cohort doesn’t grow and remains at 100% NDR. CAC increases linearly with NDR. The Effective MTR grows from 18 months to 29 months, also a 60% increase, which could imply a 60% increase in sales and marketing expense if you decide to float your CAC based on NDR. So, the math is easy. The key question to deciding whether to scale your CAC as a function of NDR is: how confident are you in your ability to sustain your planned NDR over the long term? And how much risk are you willing to assume given your balance sheet?

Recently, we’ve seen a series of product-driven companies building huge customer bases with tremendous account expansion and terrific sales efficiency. DataDog is no exception. DataDog provides a very popular IT monitoring solution that has grown from its founding in 2010 to a huge business. During that time the product has grown from infrastructure monitoring to application performance management, logging and user experience products. The company published its S-1 Friday. DataDog counts more than 8800 customers, 590 of which spend more than $100k, and 40 of which spend more than a $1M. No customer represents more than 5% of ARR, which means the largest customer isn’t spending more than $15M a year - still huge. The company’s business is predominantly in the US. 24% of revenues are international. Additionally, the product expansion has borne fruit. New products generated 35% of bookings last year. The company is currently at $333M in quarterly ARR and generated $265M in trailing 12 months revenues, up from $145M the previous period. Look at that beautiful curve! To put the company’s stellar trajectory in context, I’ve plotted its metrics relative to two other incredible monitoring companies: NewRelic (NEWR) and AppDynamics (APPD). NewRelic is public and is worth $3.3B as of this morning. Cisco acquired AppDynamics for $3.7B in 2017, the day before their IPO. At the time of IPO, both DDOG and APPD filed at about $200M in revenue. NewRelic filed with about $85M. This has more to do  with the trend that current IPOs tend to be around $200M and New Relic went public in 2014, when the median revenue at IPO was closer to $100M. New Relic and DataDog grew at similar rates in the year before the IPO at about 95% each. AppDynamics grew 150%, quite a bit more. But this chart doesn’t tell the whole story. DataDog is 2x the scale of New Relic but growing just as fast. And as for the comparison to AppD… DataDog is effectively profitable compared to its peers, who were at about -65% net income margin. An amazing feat to be growing fast at scale and profitable. Here’s why: For every dollar of sales and marketing investment, DataDog generates $1.68 of gross profit, 60% better than the others. A big part of this sales efficiency is the net dollar retention difference across the group. NDR is the value of a cohort of customers one year after they sign. It includes lost and expanded customers. In DataDog’s case, a cohort that generated $100 last year will generate $151 this year, more than 22% higher than NEWR and APPD. DataDog’s average customer is worth $23k at IPO, compared to $8k for New Relic and $104k for AppDynamics. This average and the data points above about the number of $100k and $1M accounts suggests DataDog serves customers across the spectrum. NewRelic started with smaller accounts. AppDynamics started with enterprise accounts and they met in the mid-market. DataDog is playing across price points. One last chart: revenue dollars at IPO per venture dollar invested. This is a measure of turning investment dollars into revenue, a sort of return on equity metric. DataDog’s return on equity is 2-4x its peers. In every dimension, DataDog is an exceptional business. It has a beautiful and efficient product-led go-to-market that enables it to grow at incredible rates efficiently. Congratulations to the team and the investors in the business on a marvelous company.

Which sectors see more startup company formation than others? The answer has changed quite a bit over the last 8 years. Some sectors have hit their apogee and are declining. Others have grown by more than 3x. Yet others are growing geometrically. Let’s take a look. Hot Spaces Artificial Intelligence - yes, it’s a buzzword but it’s more than that. AI or Machine Learning is a new technology that will benefit nearly every type of sector and we’re still in the very earliest innings. Eight years ago, there were nearly zero AI startups seeded. Today, that number is 400 and the chart is a classic S-curve, tapering after a period of intense growth. Blockchain - another exponential curve that shows growth from 0 to 200 startups in eight years. Blockchain is clearly the category with the steepest slope. We can’t predict when the curve will resemble an S, but given the trajectory, it won’t be soon. FinTech - challenger banks, new electronic stock brokers, AI-powered investment advisors; startups are besieging the incumbents of this regulated world and assailing them in ever greater numbers. Food and Beverage - the way we eat and farm is evolving quickly. Vertical farming, novel protein sources which replace meats, branded water in a can that resembles beer so you won’t be lampooned at a party. Consumer preferences are evolving and startups are rising to meet the demand. Software - up more than 3x, Software is a perennial category. Automating expensive internal processes in novel ways is Levi’s 501 jean of the startup world: a stylish classic that will never go out of style. Cooling Spaces Advertising - Google and Facebook have dominated the online advertising world. With their end-to-end visibility of the user, publisher and advertiser relationship, few in the ecosystem can compete. Analytics - surprisingly, this category has seen its zenith. A few winners have emerged. But the recent wave of consolidation (Tableau, Looker, Periscope) suggests more opportunity might beckon founders soon. Big Data - largely powered by Hadoop adoption, Big Data’s heyday is yesterday. The world has moved on from MapReduce jobs and is reverting to other data sources that speak SQL natively or are cloud-native. Social Media - Facebook went public in 2012. Two years later, founders no longer started companies in social media.  Facebook’s hegemony reduced the rates of social media seeding by more than 65%. Overall, the data is consistent with our observations on the ground. Many sectors have fallen out of favor, and others have risen suddenly. A contrarian might found a company in a deflating category; a counter-argument might be to ride the next big wave and start there. Whichever your perspective, the main conclusion is that there’s an incredible amount of opportunity.

Earlier this year, I read Algorithms to Live By, a book that explains how to use insights from computer science in daily life. One of the rules is the 37% rule. It’s an important rule because it’s broadly applicable. But I had forgotten about it until I listened to the author on the Software Engineering Daily podcast . The 37% rule says that if you have a decision to make, you should spend 37% of the amount of time you have. This is called exploration period. Seek advice, learn about demands of the role, and meet some candidates. After you’ve explored, you transition to exploit. Exploit in this context doesn’t mean to take advantage of or misuse, but to seize the opportunity and capitalize on your knowledge. How do you do that? You pick the best candidate you’ve met so far or meet very shortly thereafter. For example, assume you need to hire a salesperson or a marketer. If you give yourself 90 days, spend the first 33 days and then pick the best choice immediately after that. You’ll find the optimal candidate 37% of the time, which is an odd coincidence. This strategy, however, is the optimal one. Computer scientists call this the multi-armed bandit problem. A one-armed bandit is another name for a slot machine. If you go to a casino and want to optimize your winnings, how do you pick the right slot machine? You spend 37% of your time figuring out which machine is lucky and then spend the rest of the time with that machine. Once you look for this pattern, you’ll see it many places. Children try many different things but elderly people focus on the things they love.  Each are on opposite ends of this continuum - called the explore vs exploit tradeoff. You visit a restaurant frequently because you love it. How many dishes should you try before settling on a favorite? 37%. We see it in startups all the time. For example, an early-stage startup spends some amount of its life figuring out the right sales strategy. It might take a few months or a few years to identify the correct playbook, ideal customer profile, and product to sell. Then the business transitions to scaling. The first period is the explore period and the second the exploit period.

If you must choose a long term headquarters for your startup, call an executive recruiter who focuses in that city. Ask her about each of the key roles your company will need to hire in the next 2 to 3 years. VP Engineering, VP Product, VP Sales, VP Customer Success, VP Marketing, or VP Operations. How large is the candidate pool for each search? Which are the hardest searches to complete in this geography? Where are the best talent pools to sift through? After establishing product market fit, the startups grow their management team to scale. Three prototypes exist: hire from the outside, cultivate talent internally, and a combination. By far the most common is the last. Startups typically promote several leaders from within the business and hire a few from outside. This balances the risks of hiring less known leaders with the benefits of adding external perspectives and experience. Without a large pool of talent to mine, a startup will struggle to hire teams. The business may need to relocate someone, train someone, or hire someone remote. These challenges are surmountable, but they blunt the startup’s advantage: speed. The hiring challenge will recur and reverberate immediately and for a long time. Once hired, the executive will build his team, most likely hiring from his network. He will seek people with relevant experience. If there are few, team construction will lag. Some startups solve this problem with distributed teams . The same perspective applies to them. When starting a new office, pick the location based on talent pool. And who better to call to understand the labor market dynamics than an executive recruiter from that locale?

My perception of books was shattered in first grade. A friend and I were arguing about the extinction of dinosaurs. “It’s right here!” I yelled pointing to the book in my hand.“A meteor crashed, cooled the earth, and killed all the dinosaurs.“ My friend countered with a book of his own. Volcanic eruptions had blackened the sky with ash and cooled the earth, he recited. Locked in stalemate, we appealed to a higher authority. Our science teacher told us that the books were just one person’s opinion. No one knows why the dinosaurs died but other species lived. Each of our books were speculation. To this day, scientists still don’t have a unified view . In that moment, books lost their authority. Each book has its own insights and biases and that’s what makes them so fascinating. When you read, you have to sift through the stream of sentences to pan for the bias and the insight. If you read The Things They Carried and then The Sympathizer , you’ll have studied diametrically opposed perspectives on the Vietnam War. The Dalai Lama’s My Spiritual Journey and Christopher Hitchen’s God is Not Great each advocate passionately for a different view of religion and spirituality. The breezy, crisp punches of Hemingway’s stories oppose the gangling vines of Faulkner’s endless lexical Amazons. Since then, I’ve read as much as I can. I’ve also read lots about how to read books: speedreading, skimming, memorization. None of them have translated into reading more. But one thing has: an electronic library card tied to a Kindle . You can get one online, signup with your mobile phone number and start checking out books in less than five minutes. Books can be expensive. $10 for a paperback, $17 for a novel, $30 for a new release. Pretty quickly, you can spend more on books each month than a fully loaded cable subscription. Instead, you can borrow an ebook or audiobook for free. It appears on a Kindle a few seconds later and disappears on cue, returned to the library in the cloud, right on time. The due date is a motivator to finish the book. And the price means you can keep up on all the advances in dinosaur extinction.

A little while ago, we were lucky to host Guillaume Cabane at Office Hours in a new format: 30 minute 1-on-1s with a few companies. It was a huge success and a format that we will continue because of all the learning. Guillaume was kind to share some takeaways from the event below. If you’re in B2B SaaS, you most likely have a finite TAM. For the love of ARR, please get the exact list of all accounts in your TAM (at least US). Do some simple math to output a predicted value per account. Then decide which accounts you want to go after, with which channels, at what cost. Start charting your TAM penetration (in volume & separately in value) When doing outbound, lead with value. Never send an email where you focus on you or your product. If your contact to demo rate is below 1%, you’re burning your TAM inefficiently. Top companies with a strong brand, leading with value in an email, often get >10% demo rate on cold emails. Differentiate yourself. Think of your marketing like your product. Would you create the same features as your competitors? Of course not. Your marketing can be a defensible moat: use different words, leverage different channels. In essence, try to be memorable. If you’ve scored your TAM, you now know how much you can invest for each potential account. Be smart about it, maximize the effectiveness of that spend to create an experience unlike your competitor. And if you love your VC, don’t compete head on with paid channels. Paid is an OK channel at best, great if you can get a CAC/LTV < 1 (rare in SaaS). Guillaume has an exquisitely tuned acumen for how to build scalable marketing systems. Watching him advise startups on how to build their machines, I noticed how much of an innovative thinker he is. The notes above echo it. Thank you so much for coming to SaaS Office Hours, Guillaume. And for revealing the magic behind the way you’ve built your teams.

I’ve written before about the Jacob’s Ladder of Fundraising . The Jacob’s Ladder is a children’s toy that flips over, and it’s a great metaphor for the seed market. Seed rounds are rapidly approaching and now often equal to the sizes of Series As just five years ago. The chart above shows the mean round size in the US across. As the Jacob’s Ladder flips, a series of important strategic questions arise in the market. For founders, the increase of seed rounds (and the proliferation of seed derivatives like pre/post/second seeds) are a boon. A greater diversity of financial products serve a broader set of founder needs. Wonderful. It means now there are many more ways to reach $10M in ARR. $1M or $3M or $5M seed. $7M or $12M or $15M or $25M Series A. Mix and match the financial product to the company need at the time. This week we saw a $10M round at $800M in Notion. If you’re a bottoms up, product driven, capital efficient business, that operates at a profit, a $2M seed for 10% of the business may be enough to reach that $20M Series A. If you prefer to build a business that consumes more capital either for ramping GTM or developing a more technical product, a $5M seed might be a better bet. Competition amongst investors drives this this panoply of options in  the seed market. Seed investors are moving up, with some raising bigger funds. Series A investors must choose to move earlier into the new seed rounds, or play later in bigger Series As (the Series Bs of yore). The same dynamic is occuring at most stages of venture investing. And this means that the financial product that we call the Series Seed or Series A is meaningless; it’s just the header on the fundraising documents. The previously fixed financial products that existed in 2008 of a $4-6M Series A and a $10-12M Series B are gone. Instead of these arbitrary discrete ranges, the market has evolved to provide a smooth continuum of fundraising options. Competition has brought diversity and innovation into the private capital markets. And once again, it’s the founders who reap the benefits. Namely, much more diverse and varied financing options to suit the precise needs of a particular startup. Which is the right fundraising product for your business? In this market, it’s choose your own adventure.

Wing.vc published the Enterprise Tech 30 last week. It’s a coaches poll of the top enterprise startups broken into early, mid and growth stage. Congratulations to all the companies and in particular, the 8 Redpoint companies on the list: Mattermost, Cockroach Labs, LaunchDarkly, Tray.io, AppZen, Snowflake, Hashicorp and Stripe. Coaches polls are fun because they provide a different perspective on the market. I analyzed the data set and added a few columns to it to see if there are any trends. I categorized each company by their primary buyer. Engineering dominates with 37%. Many is the next category. These are products that sell across departments: Mattermost, Notion, Zapier, etc. Design is next, followed by Sales and Finance. These are very different buyers than I expected. A few years ago, I analyzed the public market cap of SaaS companies by buyer . HR and Sales dominated, with IT a close third. Engineering barely made the list. I should re-run that analysis. But this data suggests the distribution will be markedly different in a few years. 5 of the 11 companies selling to engineering are open source - about half. Open source remains a viable customer acquisition strategy despite the threat from the cloud vendors; Amazon in particular. Next, I divided the top 30 companies by their place in the stack. We think of enterprise companies in three layers. Applications are software used by business users. Platform includes products that help developers to build applications: payment gateways and low code platforms. Infrastructure comprises core information technology: databases, monitoring, key management. Application and Infrastructure companies each represent about 40% with Platform filling out the rest. If we were to weight this by market cap, we would see a different result since Stripe’s most recent round values the company at $22B+. The data does suggest there are fewer companies in the platform layer, though, which is consistent with our experience. Last, I bucketed the companies into price segments: SMB, Mid-Market and Enterprise, based on my estimates of their ACVs. As I’ve said many times, there are many ways to build a very successful business. And the data shows that. There’s a broad distribution of companies across each price segment. It’s always interesting to see how other investors view the enterprise market. Thanks to the team at Wing for pulling together this great survey.

In Rethinking Customer Churn Rate & LTV/CAC , Thibaud Clement illuminates a counter-intuitive concept about churn. The faster you increase your growth rate (acceleration rate), the higher the churn rate. Consider the same startup under two scenarios: one in which the acceleration rate is 50% and one in which the acceleration rate is 0%. In the 50% scenario, churn will be 67% higher. A surprising result. Why does this happen? Because the odds of churn decrease with time, particularly for products with monthly billing. If a business acquires many customers in one month, a big chunk of the customer base is at the point of highest churn risk. We should define acceleration rate. 50% acceleration rate means your growth rate increases 50% per month. In month 1, it’s 7%; month 2, 10.5%; month 3, 15.75%. In other words, acceleration rate is the first derivative of MRR growth. For most companies, this will be a short-lived phenomenon because it’s very difficult to maintain high acceleration rates for very long. Growing from 10% m/m to 15% m/m is quite possible in the sub-$5m ARR range, but much harder at $20m in ARR. At that scale, acceleration rate is typically negative (i.e., growth slows). There’s a corollary: this means as growth slows, churn decreases, assuming no changes in customer behavior. A greater fraction of the customer base is mature and much more likely to continue to pay. If your SaaS business is growing really fast, and you’re wondering why churn is growing despite high NPS (net promoter score) or other metrics, this is why.

When I shared the Redpoint SaaS Metrics Template, I wrote about the difficulty I had identifying key engineering metrics. I was grateful for all the responses from leaders at many startups to share their expertise. I’ve updated the template with a few metrics. Reliability - percent of application requests that load. 1 minus reliability is the percentage downtime. This measures the durability of the application. Availability - percent of application requests that load within a certain latency. 99% uptime means for 99% of seconds within a month, the application responded to requests within 5 seconds. Each company should define the acceptable latency. This measures the responsiveness of the application. Incident rate - support case count divided by active users. This is a proxy for product quality. If the support case count declines on a per user basis, this indicates product quality broadly defined has improved. I think these three metrics provide a sense of engineering efforts for boards and executives to discuss. I wish there a way to get a sense of engineering cadence or productivity (similar to AE quota attainment), but that remains elusive. Thank you to everyone who wrote in!

When we published the results of the freemium survey earlier this year , we noticed respondents targeting the enterprise observed higher net dollar retention and lower churn than those startups targeting other segments. I wondered if we could observe any other patterns about enterprise businesses, so I produced this analysis of public companies with ACVs (annual contract values) of $100k or greater. In the series of charts that follow, the red bars indicate the value of the metric during the year of IPO. And the blue dashed line is the median. Revenue growth at IPO spans quite a wide range from FireEye’s 148% to Financial Engine’s 19%. The median is 70%, which is consistent across all other modern software companies at IPO. Gross margins are also span the gamut from 79% to 34%. These distributions indicate that there’s no clustering as a result of a higher price point. However, in this case, the $100K gross margins of 60% are about 10% lower than the entire population sitting at 66%. The p value is 0.1 suggesting the difference has a high likelihood of being a material difference. There are a few potential hypotheses for this. Gross margins are lower when customer support costs are higher and when hosting costs are higher. If enterprise customers demand more support or if they demand more expensive infrastructure (like single tenant databases), they may impose lower gross margins on their vendors. Last, enterprise customers often demand more professional services which tend to run at much lower gross margins than software, which may also depress the margins. Examining net income margin (profitability), we find one outlier in Hortonworks. Again, a broad distribution exists. The median NIM at IPO is -31% identical to -29% across the board. Next, let’s turn to Sales and Marketing as a Percentage of Revenue. The most efficient here is Veeva, spending only 15% of revenue on sales, just incredible. The median is 54%, which again doesn’t deviate from the population as a whole. Last, let’s examine payback period. We know churn rates are meaningfully lower for enterprise companies. Does the other side of the customer equation also favor them? The median estimated payback period is 18 months. Veeva clocked 3.7 months and Hortonworks 29 months. The median across all companies is 15.5 months compared to 18.4 months in the enterprise. But the t test suggests no meaningful difference, with a p value of 0.97, indicating the means are identical. In conclusion, the only meaningful difference between enterprise companies and the rest of the public software population is a slightly lower gross margin - about a 10% decline - relative to others.

Every six months or so, I take a look at how the public markets are valuing next-generation software companies. There’s been quite a bit of volatility over the last five years, and this update is no exception. As of mid-June, the public markets value software companies at all-time highs. The chart above shows the total enterprise value (TEV)/forward revenue multiple for the basket of public software companies. Just a quick reminder on these metrics. Enterprise value equals market capitalization plus debt minus cash and short-term equivalents. Forward revenue is the sum of the projected revenues over the next 12 months. The blue line the chart is the median over the period which is approximately 5.7x. The red line shows the median across the stocks in that particular month. In 2014, the median touched 7.7x forward before falling by about 60% to 3.3x two years later. Since then, we’ve seen an incredible bull run that brought the forward multiples to 9.5x. A correction followed to 7.1x at the end of 2018. Next, a resurgence back to 9.6x forward. In short, we are in the priciest valuation environment of the last seven years. Let’s break this down by stock. Zoom tops the list at 44x forward, followed by ZScaler and Okta at around 25x. Then Veeva and Atlassian at 21x. These are numbers we’ve never seen before. On the other hand, these are also some incredibly efficient businesses growing at incredible rates in very large markets. And investors understand these businesses at a deeper level than they have in the past because companies disclose key metrics like net dollar retention. So a question arises: is the market indiscriminate in the way values companies? The answer is no. About half of the stocks have witnessed declines in multiples in the last 12 months, some very significantly. On the other hand, others have seen massive expansion, nearly doubling of multiples. In other words, the variance of valuations has exploded. The chart above shows that the variance of the forward multiple has increased from about 3x to about 7.6x in the last six months. It’s another way of saying that   multiples have expanded at the upper end of the spectrum quite significantly. We’ve always seen some software businesses trade at 3x and 5x, but we’ve rarely seen businesses trade at more than 20x. The most attractive companies have become much, much, much more expensive relative to their peers. The chart above is a correlation chart between the change in forward multiple over the last 12 months and the current forward multiple. If a stock had a big multiple 12 months ago is very likely that the multiple has expanded by 50% or greater since then. The R squared is 0.83, indicating a very strong relationship. This multiple expansion is great news for public companies. It means they can raise capital at lower and lower costs, and smaller and smaller dilution. These multiples imply investors believe these businesses can continue to execute very well in massive markets for years to come . But they do raise questions about whether we will see reversion to the mean in the near future.

Just a few months ago, we partnered with Mattermost and led the Series A . We believe that open source applications will be an important part of the future of software because of their security, lower costs of customer acquisition and the flexibility they offer customers. Today, Mattermost is announcing a $50M Series B from Y Combinator Continuity and Battery. I’m thrilled to partner with Ali Rowghani from Y Combinator and Neeraj Agarwal from Battery for the next leg of the journey. They both share the same vision of open source application software changing the enterprise landscape. Customer after customer connects Mattermost to their most important systems. Often, these systems are invisible to the Internet. Security operations teams create air-gapped networks for incident response, operations teams developing workflows to fetch logs from different systems to remediate outages, and IT teams developing powerful workflows to automate inbound support tickets from their users - all on Mattermost. Mattermost’s momentum is a result of tremendous developer adoption. Developers love the product because they can customize it. They modify the UI to incorporate key development and deployment metrics, embed Mattermost chat into internal applications, and rich communication support for gifs and emojis. And because it’s written in Go and compiles to single binary, Mattermost installs and upgrades easily. Just copy a single file to your server. And it scales and scales handling tens of thousands of concurrent requests. The collaboration market is measured in the tens of billions. Enterprise buyers’ increased desire for data control, compliance and security signifies a substantial chunk of that market is addressable by open source. Mattermost’s Series B is another step forward to fulfilling that ambition. Congratulations to the team on another great milestone.

Over the last decade or so, I’ve compiled a metrics sheet to summarise a SaaS business. While no living document like this is ever perfect, this is currently the best board-level summary of the overall health of a business I have found. I’m sharing it so that others may benefit and improve it. If you have suggestions, please email me. Google Sheet: Theory SaaS Metrics Template Direct Download: Theory SaaS Metrics Template (xlsx) The template is broken into six sections: People, Bookings & Revenue, Cash, Sales, Marketing, Customer Success. People is the first section because people are a startup’s most important element. This section covers employee satisfaction, headcount, and recruiting metrics. Indicators of challenges include a spike of  non-regretted attrition or a decreasing employee satisfaction score. Bookings and Revenue illuminates the company’s performance in closing new business (bookings) and recurring revenue. These are pretty straightforward. Cash works through the cash balance, burn and implied number of operational months. Sales breaks down the new customer acquisition metrics: total AEs, number of ramping account executives, bookings capacity, quota attainment and so on. It’s important to track the number of leads in the conversion rates to sales generated by sales. Oftentimes, companies won’t make explicit the lead generation responsibilities between sales and marketing, but I think that’s really important to diagnosing potential issues in the go to market. Marketing digs into lead generation and conversion metrics. Also, unit economics for repayment and lead velocity rate. Months to repay is a powerful composite metric that describes the ultimate efficiency of the marketing lead acquisition portfolio. Customer Success reviews the net dollar and logo retention, plus churns and expansions. You’ll notice there is no engineering section. I found it’s really difficult to identify consistent metrics of engineering performance. Lines of code, count of P0 bugs, days of delay in releases. So engineering tends to be more qualitative, if so I hope someone can surface a better way. The template is meant to provide a high-level overview of a business and identify where areas of excellence and areas worthy of deeper investigation. It’s another tool for your workbench.

Next week, on the 27th of June, Redpoint will host Office Hours with Guillaume Cabane . Guillaume is an exceptional marketer. He built the highly successful growth practices at Segment and Drift. He stands out because of his persistence at the cutting edge. I remember when he told me of how he used the Clearbit Reveal API to change the content of conversations in Drift pop-ups to meaningfully improve conversion. He’s always at the vanguard of using technology to drive awareness and demand for SaaS products. Typically, Office Hours are hour long fireside chats with a speaker. We host them at our office in San Francisco and we gather questions from a small audience of about 30-40 people in a closed door format. This time, we’re trying a new format. Over the course of two hours, we’ll invite four startups to conduct one-on-one office hours for 30 minutes with Guillaume and I to discuss go-to-market issues and questions facing their startup. Apply to attend these office hours here. Demand for these events often exceeds our hosting capacity, so we will email confirmations five days before the event.

Yesterday, Salesforce announced it would acquire Tableau for $15.7B. Tableau sells data visualization software and the team has built an incredible business. We analyzed the S-1 in 2014 . The company has grown since its public offering to generate about $1.1B in revenue, growing at 29%. Let’s put this acquisition in context. First, it’s the third business intelligence related acquisition in the past month. Google announced the Looker acquisition last week . SiSense acquired Periscope Data . And now Salesforce is merging with Tableau. This wave of consolidation in the BI world suggests this is a key area of competition amongst the biggest software companies in the world over the next decade. Collectively, these acquirers have spent $18.4B on these three businesses. Second, the Salesforce/Tableau acquisition is the third largest software acquisition since 2012, second to Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn and IBM purchasing RedHat. Third, Salesforce paid 11.2x trailing (or last 12 months’ revenue) for Tableau, which is the lower middle of the multiples across these transactions. I’ve included only companies who have disclosed their financials in this data set. To get a sense of how this price and multiple compares in clearer terms, lets look at multiples vs growth rate. The 2019 mergers are in red. They include Tableau, SendGrid and Hortonworks. Tableau is the middle red dot. These acquisition multiples are in line with the two previous years of large acquisitions, suggesting that the pricing in the M&A market for the first six months of 2019 hasn’t changed materially. The $23.9B in acquisitions suggests that 2019 will be similarly active as 2018, which saw $66B of acquisitions. It’s all good news for startups.

You’ve found product market fit. You’ve hired a team, including some managers. Your initial, small customer base is very happy. You’ve discovered an initial channel of customer acquisition that’s working. You’ve raised a meaningful round of capital. And then, right then, product innovation decelerates to zero. The fast pace that characterized the past 12-18 months, when you would germinate an idea and write the code in less than a few days, has evaporated. Suddenly, the product and engineering teams are bogged down. Every innovation requires a Herculean effort to achieve. Why? Why does this fact pattern evolve in many software companies? Here are the most common reasons I’ve seen. First, technical debt. The freewheeling, hedonistic days of idea to instantiation in an instant are over. They’ve left you with the hangover of technical debt. Architectural issues arise that the team didn’t anticipate when you were building features for a single customer or isolated use case. Now, there’s a growing customer base and more complex integrations. It’s time to shore up the initial infrastructure with production ready code. This happens at nearly every company, even Google . Few people are as motivated to refactor code as write new features. Combine technical debt with demoralized people and you get molasses every time. Second, the founder/CEO’s once singular focus on product is no longer possible. Rewind a year ago, when 90% of their time was spent on product: finding product market fit, understanding customer needs, translating that into a vision and mocks to be coded. Today, the demands on the CEO’s time have exploded manifold. Fundraising, recruiting, press, hiring, managing, board meetings; the task count and diversity has exploded. Instead of focusing 90% on product, they may have 15% or 20%. Without someone driving the product roadmap, product innovation decelerates. Third, inertia. As your customer base grows, the product can’t move as quickly as you’d like because each iteration requires existing customer education. Even minor UI tweaks spike inbound customer support queries, which cost real money. Fourth, testing. There’s a colloquialism for a collection of testing software within the quality assurance world: harness. The idea is to harness the furious efforts of the thoroughbred engineering team into a smooth release process that ensures few errors for customers in production. At this stage, the mot juste isn’t a harness, but a yoke, a heavy wooden cross beam braced across the shoulders of oxen. Because just as the engineering team has accrued technical debt, so has quality assurance. Few companies have invested the effort during the crusade for product market fit to develop a robust testing suite. But as the business scales, testing becomes another key part of scaling infrastructure that requires significant investment, without any user-facing advances. Most of these issues cannot be countered. Developing tests before product market fit isn’t worthwhile. You might anticipate inertia, but you won’t be able to meaningfully change customer behavior; we all habituate to software as we learn it. But startups can focus on these areas when they arise by prioritizing great quality assurance, creating transition plans for existing customers, and finding a way for someone in the organization to run product nearly full time again; either by hiring someone and delegating that responsibility, or by delegating the other parts of the CEO job and focusing on product.

Today, Looker is announcing they are joining Google Cloud . During the past seven years, Looker has evolved to become the business intelligence platform for the modern business, that sits atop the next-generation data warehouses like BigQuery, Snowflake and RedShift. Throughout the journey, the long term vision has always remained the same: to become the single data layer across an enterprise. And over the last seven years, Looker has taken the first big steps to seeing it through by working with hundreds of customers to empower them with data. More than building an enduring business, Looker is a company with a big heart. The culture that Lloyd and Frank imbued into the business sets it apart, and it’s an inspiration to see how they’ve built Looker into an enduring business starting with strong values. The combination of Looker and Google’s Cloud Platform is another important step to fulfilling Looker’s vision and mission. Congratulations to Looker and Google on starting a new chapter! It’s been an honor for everyone at Redpoint to partner with you.

Imagine a hypothetical startup with 10 account executives that is growing quickly. This startup has two AEs that outperform meaningfully, six that are at typical quota attainment, and two that are underperforming. Where should your sales enablement team focus their time? This is the team’s performance last year. They generated 8.6M in bookings on 10M in quota capacity (which is really good). Most teams aim for 70-75% attainment. If the sales enablement teams had focus on the top quartile AEs and improve their performance by 20%, the company would have booked $9.3M. The distribution looks like this. The two top reps jump from $3.5m to $4.2m in bookings. Nice result. How does it compare to an alternative of improving the middle two quartiles’ performance by 20%? In this case, bookings grows to $9.5M, a 10% improvement over the baseline and a more modest 2% improvement over the result from focusing on top quartile performance. If the outcomes are similar, which is better? The second is better for two reasons. First, the sales enablement team has shown they can improve performance over a broader group of people. Each salesperson has a different style and technique. Demonstrating success across more people reaffirms the enablement can work across a larger population of account executives, not just the top performers. Second, as the company scales, the middle quartiles by definition will be twice as large as the top quartile. Creating consistency within that group will eliminate big swings in bookings performance. If our top performer misses because of personal reasons, health issues, whatever, and books 0.5M instead of 2M, that’s a material impact to the business. There’s bookings concentration risk. By enabling more AEs to contribute consistently, the startup mitigates some of that concentration risk. This is analogous to building a repeatable inside sales team to complement the higher variance field sales teams. The Monte Carlo simulation we ran shows the impact on bookings can be meaningful and unpredictable. Same idea here. Predictable growth is the most attractive characteristic of a business. Focusing enablement efforts on creating consistency in the middle of the sales team is an important step to establishing a reliable cadence of success.

In 2013, Scott Berkun authored a book called The Year Without Pants. Scott shared his experience working remotely for Wordpress. After I read the book, I wrote : In the coming years, video conferencing and online meetings will become much more prevalent as stories like the ones Scott shares are told and retold. If you’re looking to understand how a fully distributed team used chat and video conferencing to build a world changing product, reading The Year Without Pants is a great way to answer those questions. Six years later, it’s become a norm with a few different flavors. There are examples of fully distributed companies. Wordpress was among the earliest. Invision, Buffer and Gitlab are three others. This is a corporate structure where team members rarely come into the office and work through the internet. There are examples of semi-distributed companies. Hashicorp and Mattermost staff their GTM functions in headquarters, but manage a distributed engineering team. This structure is common across companies monetizing open source software. The engineering community contributing to a project often are scattered across the globe. They are among the best engineers to recruit to the team and the first to join. And there are plenty of examples of companies with a HQ in the US and an engineering team in another country. Ten years ago, Israel and India were the most common. Today, China, Brazil, India, Argentina, France, Ireland, Germany; you name it, there’s a startup with a remote office there. The last is something that’s not discussed as much but is increasingly common: a collection of small offices. Several of the companies in our portfolio operate the business from three or four small offices before they reach 100 people. Sometimes, management spins up new offices to start a functional team like support or success or sales development. (This is different from starting a sales office with an AE covering a region.) Other times, a key executive who operates remotely catalyzes a new office. And still other offices form from acquisitions. These new models afford startups flexibility in the way they build their companies and the talent pools to farm. This flexibility does have some trade-offs. The immediately obvious one: developing techniques to communicate well across geographies. We’ve all been the lone person to video conference when everyone else is in person. It’s much harder to be effective. Some companies employ an egalitarian policy: if one person is on video, all participants must video. The second one is managing internal communication. Many hallway conversations happen in person. How does a company share those decisions and knowledge with the distributed team? Answering this question is key to sustaining a healthy culture. Third, hiring and paying employees in other countries is complex. New legal entities, varying governmental policies for stock options, taxes, benefits, severance. This costs money and attention to get it right. Last, there’s an open question of how public market investors and in particular acquirers will evaluate a distributed team. Is there a greater risk in managing a distributed team for a classically structured acquirer? Is that outweighed by the access to talent? How does an acquirer assimilate a distributed team? It’s too early to say. Venture investors seem unfazed by these new models, and I hope that this sets the precedent for other investors and acquirers. Ultimately, these novel corporate structures are here to stay. The benefits to quality of life for employees, access to new forms of talent, and the potential labor market arbitrage are simply too compelling to pass up.

Before you raise your next round, ask yourself this question. Are there any key people you need to hire? Essential executives, critical engineers, important managers or anyone else? Your common stock value, or 409a valuation will increase the second you receive a term sheet. And the strike price of any new options will increase with the 409a valuation. Let’s take a step back. When you hire someone, you’ll grant them a salary and options. An option is the right to buy shares of the business at some future point in time. The strike price of the option is equal to the value of the common stock, which is set by the company’s board periodically, based on a report by an independent appraiser, the 409a valuation. During the early stages of a company, the board typically ratifies an updated 409a valuation annually. As the company grows and approaches an IPO, the company sets 409a valuations more frequently; starting bi-annually, then quarterly, then monthly. The 409a valuation should converge to the price of a share at IPO because the value of exercising an option at IPO should be zero, since you could just buy the share in the public markets at that price through your broker. The greater the strike price of an option, the smaller the upside. If I offer you an option to buy a share of a business at $0.01 and in ten years, the share is worth $15, your upside is $14.99. If I offer you that same option at $10, your upside is $5. I’m ignoring taxes here. Significant events in a company’s life will affect the 409a valuation. If the company meaningfully beats its plan, the valuation may increase. If public market multiples increase in value, so will the 409a. If the company completes a secondary transaction, the 409a may be impacted. The most common significant event affecting the 409a valuation of an early stage company is receiving a a term sheet for a new financing. A term sheet to finance the business or acquire the business means a third party has valued the business. That term sheet will be considered as part of the next 409a valuation process. If you receive a term sheet, you must wait until the next 409a to issue options and their strike price will be the new, higher 409a price. To maximize the value of the options to new key hires, hire them before you raise your next round. There could be a material change in the value of those options to your hires. It’s also a great tool to drive urgency in the hiring process.

As we grow in our careers, we first become individual contributors, then managers of individuals, and then managers of managers . That transition is a tough one, and one that comes very quickly in startups. A bit flips and a leader must begin to delegate. Delegation is the only way a leader of a team or company develops leverage in the organization. A good friend told me about a Vanity Fair interview with former President Obama . When asked about the stress of his days, he replied: But if you happen to be president just now, what you are faced with, mainly, is not a public-relations problem but an endless string of decisions. Putting it the way George W. Bush did sounded silly but he was right: the president is a decider. Many if not most of his decisions are thrust upon the president, out of the blue, by events beyond his control: oil spills, financial panics, pandemics, earthquakes, fires, coups, invasions, underwear bombers, movie-theater shooters, and on and on and on. They don’t order themselves neatly for his consideration but come in waves, jumbled on top of each other. “Nothing comes to my desk that is perfectly solvable,” Obama said at one point. “Otherwise, someone else would have solved it. So you wind up dealing with probabilities. Any given decision you make you’ll wind up with a 30 to 40 percent chance that it isn’t going to work. You have to own that and feel comfortable with the way you made the decision. You can’t be paralyzed by the fact that it might not work out.” On top of all of this, after you have made your decision, you need to feign total certainty about it. People being led do not want to think probabilistically. That’s effective delegation. He’s focused only on the work he is uniquely positioned to complete and exceptionally good at. I wish I had been taught how to delegate effectively. I’m not sure why this part of management wasn’t a component of the business school curriculum, but it should be. Here’s why: The management team of a company is a decision-making and productivity chokepoint. Critical decisions flow through them. If the management team ruminates on most decisions, the company’s progress stalls. In a 100 person startup, five slow-to-decide executives limit the productivity of 95 employees. In a 1000 person startup, the ratio might be 10:990. There’s enormous leverage in a hierarchical organization if the leadership moves quickly. The converse is equally true. Sluggish decision-making halts all progress. link There are a few good resources on delegation. Peter Drucker argued good decisions have four parts . The name of the directly responsible individual, or DRI; something Apple did well A clear deadline A list of people who would be involved, and communication plan A list of people who would be affected, and communication plan That’s the first step. Deciding what to do and who to do it. The second part is refraining from deciding how to do it. Define the what but delegate the how. Great delegators decentralize decision making. John Boyd talks about the importance of decentralized decisions in Certain to Win . They key concept is the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide and Act). There are lots of benefits to this. Speed is the most obvious. This management style engenders trust by creating space for others to be creative and grow. It opens up the solution space to novel ideas. The last part is measuring success and creating a culture of transparency and honesty. Any number of frameworks will work including OKRs or weekly stand-ups. The critical part is only getting involved at a deeper level if the team isn’t executing. Delegation is a critical skill for every leader. Without it, leaders become bottlenecks and slow down everyone in the business, limiting the success. With it, leaders empower people and develop tremendous leverage from the organization, and the company becomes much more than the sum of its parts. Photo by Maksym Gryshchenko on Unsplash

In a recent meeting, a founder asked me what I thought of the fundraising environment. My answer was: it’s become incredibly sophisticated along three dimensions: diversity of product offering, pricing sophistication, and efficiency of investment processes. If you read eBoys or Done Deals or Creative Capital, you’ll get a sense of the early days of the venture industry. It started out with six men at a famous restaurant in San Francisco hearing pitches over lunch. None of them could afford to lead the entire round, so they would syndicate and take turns on the board. That was the “industry.” Today, we’re a far cry from a Sancerre and oysters lunch. Last year, startups raised the most capital in history, even adjusting for inflation. Founders have at least five flavors of seed: friends & family, angel, pre-seed, seed, and post-seed. Founders can go it alone or partner with incubators and accelerators for almost every type of business. Founders can raise $7M Series As and $15M Series As. Would you like a series A from a generalist fund or a specialist fund? Founders can raise a $15M Series B or a $200M Series B. Would you like that Series B from an opportunity fund, an SPV funded by direct LP investment or from a third party? Founders can IPO, ICO or raise a unicorn round in the private markets. Founders can crowdfund. Founders can borrow venture debt or employ revolving lines of credit. Founders can sell secondary at many more stages than ever. For the right business, the number of different financial products available has never been higher. Startup valuations have become much more quantitative. That’s not to say startups trade exactly like the public market, but the pendulum has swung considerably from art to science. The pricing mechanisms in the venture market are tied much more to the public markets than at any time I’ve been in venture. Public markets price high growth software companies in terms of enterprise value to forward revenue. So do private market investors. The multiples are similar across stages. My partner Annie who spends time in marketplaces tells me there’s a similar dynamic in consumer: price is a multiple of future GMV. There’s still art and judgement of course, but many times the art is debating a premium or discount on a base multiple. The pace of the fundraising market has also changed quite a bit. The number of pre-emptive rounds is increasing. I wish I had data on this, but it’s a trend we’ve certainly noticed in our portfolio. For the most exciting businesses especially in later stages, investors catalyze fundraising processes, not founders. These pre-emptive processes require far less time to consummate than the classic process. For founders who have established product market fit, a panoply of capital choices exist. In my view, the fundraising market in 2019 is the strongest it’s ever been. Founders have more options than ever. Photo by Nathan Dumlao on Unsplash

A public market investors asked me if there are any patterns in the list of recent software IPOs with the best sales efficiencies. As I looked through the list, I noticed one. All of these businesses sell bottom up with small initial ACVs that grow dramatically.  Atlassian, Zoom, Twilio, Slack, New Relic, Elastic. All of them target small groups of users within larger organization who introduce the vendor. Over time, usage grows, accounts expand. Some acquire through open source, others through virality (Zoom). And since expanding an existing customer costs significantly less than acquiring a new one, these expansion dollars require far fewer (and potentially zero) sales and marketing investment. If a majority of bookings come from expansion, then the business develops an incredible sales efficiency. Let’s walk through an example. Imagine a $100M ARR business growing at 50% annually. Suppose the business generates 130% in net dollar retention (NDR). The business will grow this year by $50M. $30M will come from account expansion. The remaining $20M is new sales. So, this business must build a sales team large enough to generate $20M in new bookings; something like 30 account executives at $1M in annual quota and 70% attainment. Contrast the same business with 110% account expansion. The business must staff a sales team of 58 AEs, about 2x. Holding sales and marketing costs constant, that means the sales and marketing spend of the second business is 2x, and the sales efficiency is half. A few questions arise: First, in order to generate great NDR, does the business require a small ACV? Yes. The companies above with greater than 1.0 in sales efficiency have an average ACV of $5.5k with a standard deviation of $0.9k; a very tight band. But there’s an important caveat. These businesses have smaller initial ACVs but target mid-market and enterprise accounts, where total account values can be $100k+. For example, Slack’s ACV is $4.5k but accounts worth $100k generate 40% of revenues. Second, if a business has a very good NDR, is sales efficiency the right way to analyze a business? Probably not since the expansion dollars boost the implied sales efficiency materially. In many of these businesses, customer success drives the expansion, rather than sales. To get a better sense of the sales and marketing performance, the sales efficiency should be calculated on new logo acquisition solely, unless the sales and marketing teams exert significant effort in the expansion motions. Third, to have a great sales efficiency number, do you need a great NDR? The answer is quite likely yes. 42% of sales efficiency is explained by NDR. Fourth, do companies with great NDR spend materially less on sales and marketing (and is the theory proposed in the second question validated in practice)? It’s a very strong yes. NDR has a -73% correlation with reduced sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. To summarize, if you want to build a business with world class sales efficiency develop a product that is adopted bottoms up but that grow to $100k+ ACVs in a large market.

As I looked through the list of public SaaS companies this morning, I read their forward multiples. ZScaler: 23.1x; Okta: 21.8x; Veeva: 18.8x; Coupa: 18.6x; Shopify: 17.0x. Those multiples are calculated by dividing the enterprise value today by its projected future revenue of the company. But what do they mean? What do they imply? First, we need to set some context. There are two kinds of companies: those valued on growth and those valued on profits. All of the companies mentioned above and the vast majority of startups are valued on growth. That’s because most of the value creation of the business is yet to occur . Companies valued on profits typically grow at rates of -15% to 15% annually are likely to be valued on profits, typically EBITDA. Since high growth companies are valued for their future potential rather that current profits, growth rate is the predominant driver of valuation (highest correlation)[1]. In other words, growth companies are valued on their future revenues, also called forward or NTM revenue for Next Twelve Months revenues. To estimate a business’ value, we need two numbers. The revenue and the multiple. For a startup to increase its value, it must grow revenues or the market must increase its multiple. Multiples may increase for many reasons. Better efficiency, good stock market conditions, belief in the management team, net dollar retention, etc. I’ve been tracking forward revenue multiples for SaaS companies over the past 17 years or so. The median across all businesses is about 5.5x and the top quartile was around 9x. Today, we’re at elevated levels approaching a 10x median. The top quartile trade at 20x forward. Now let’s talk about what the multiple implies. Assume we have a company generating $200M in revenue, growing at 50%, then 45%, then 40%, then 35%. The revenue ramp will be $200M, $300M, $435M, $609M and $822M. How much is this business worth? If we were using the historical median, it would be worth $300M x 9 or $2.7B. Using today’s multiples, it’s worth $300M x 20 or $6.0B. Those figures assume the company will execute its plan for the next year: one year of “perfect execution[2].” If it underperforms, the multiple will fall. If it outperforms, the multiple may increase. Another thought experiment: Suppose you believe the stock market today is going to revert to the mean. That means the top quartile multiple falls to the historical top quartile multiple of 9x. The value of our business will compress to $2.7B this year. And to be worth $6B+ , the company would need to execute perfectly for the next three years. It would need to trade on $822M in forward revenue at a 9x multiple, and it would trade that way in three years, when it generates $609M in revenue. If an investor believes the long term historical median is the right multiple to value a business, then today’s valuations price in a lot of risk: three years of perfect execution. If on the other hand, you believe SaaS companies should trade higher than historical averages, and they are correctly priced, then you are assuming one year of risk. How much risk an investor assumes, that’s all up to them! So what does the multiple imply? How many years and months an investor of perfect execution an investor is willing to believe. [1] When a startup so IPOs, some are quick critique the business’ lack of profits. If the business is growing quickly - 30% or more - profits matter less. A business growing 50% per year will grow to 2.25x in two years. Investors wager those profits will come as the business matures. Of course, a credible path to profitability is important to ensure the business is viable long term. [2]Perfect execution: by this I mean the company hitting its plan. Most public companies have internal plans and street plans, and significant margin for error between them.

Slack has transformed the way we work. By replacing email with beautiful and simple internal chat, Slack has productized productivity. Founded as a gaming company called Tiny Speck in 2009, the company’s initial product, Glitch, didn’t catch on as expected. So the business pivoted to commercialize an internal tool - a S earchable L og of A ll C onversation and K nowledge, Slack. Since those early days, the company has grown to employ 1500 employees according to their S-1 . The company filed to trade under the ticker SK. Let’s examine this remarkable company and compare it to Zoom , another recent IPO in enterprise collaboration. Also, we’ll compare metrics to a peer group with similar ACVs. Slack generated $105m in revenue in 2017, $221m in 2018 and $401m in 2019. Note these years are fiscal years, not calendar years. Slack, like many others, uses a fiscal year that ends of January 31st. Zoom, in blue has been smaller in each year, but is growing faster.This compares to $61m, $151m and $331m in revenue for Zoom. Both of these businesses are growing incredibly quickly. Slack grew 110% and 82% in 2018 and 2019, compared to Zoom’s 149% and 118%. Examining growth rate across a peer set of companies with similar ACVs, Slack has attained a growth rate similar to Atlassian at IPO, which is amazing thing considering the size of the business at the time of the IPO. Across the peer set, Slack’s revenue at IPO is substantially larger than others: 20% larger than Zoom and Atlassian, and 371% larger than New Relic. Slack’s average annual contract value is the smallest of the group at $4.6k and closest to Zoom’s. This is an interesting parallel: the two fastest growing and largest collaboration tools of the past decade both pursued bottoms-up strategies. Slack has approximately 17 users per organization on average (though the distribution likely follows a power law with a few organizations in the tens and potentially hundreds of thousands of seats). The number of $100k+ accounts has about doubled year over year to 575 out of total customer base of 88,000, and these large customers constitute 40% of revenue. Slack’s combination of greater revenue and a smaller ACV translates into a much larger customer base: 88k customers in 2019 vs 51k for Zoom. Slack records 143% net dollar retention, which is top decile according to Redpoint’s freemium study , and dead center of the peer group and equal to Zoom. Let’s compare gross margin. Slack’s gross margin is consistently five to six points above Zoom. This makes sense since Zoom bears greater infrastructure costs for hosting video compared to Slack which hosts mostly text and images. Slack’s sales efficiency exceeds 111%, which is sensational. One dollar of sales and marketing spend today generates $1.11 in gross profit next year. Zoom’s sales efficiency is at 180%. One hypothesis to explain the difference: Zoom is externally viral while Slack is internally viral; we send Zoom invitations outside of our companies, but Slack messages to our colleagues. In terms of net income margin/profitability, Slack is closest to Twilio at -34% net income margin. The company has been operating the business consistently at -$40m in net income for the past three years, as revenue has grown from $105m to $401m, and the net income has become decreasingly negative with time, a positive trend. As I wrote about in the Zoom S-1, Zoom has generated profits throughout its growth. There are two major drivers of this profitability. The first is the sales efficiency, mentioned above. The second is Zoom very efficient R&D expense because the majority of its engineering resides in China. And this comes out in the data. Slack spends 39% of revenues on R&D compared to 10% for Zoom. In dollar terms, that’s $156m vs $33m. In addition, Zoom employs 1000 people to Slack at 1500 people, 33% less. Slack’s business is a marvel of scale, expansion and growth. It’s going to be an exceptionally valuable business. Congratulations to the Slack team on building an incredible business.

Charlie Munger is famous for championing the idea of mental models . Mental models help us think about the world by simplifying very complex topics into more digestible and tractable ideas. The challenge with mental models is first learning about them and second figuring out which model applies when. We use mental models in our daily lives. The 80/20 rule is the Pareto Principle. Focus on the stuff that will yield 80% of the result with 20% of the work. Scott Page’s The Model Thinker is a deeper dive into the theory of mental models and the math behind them. Page  is a professor at the University of Michigan, and his book explores mental models in a wonderful way. Two of those explanations have stuck with me. The first is about random walks. Imagine ten startups (or venture firms) competing. Assume they have an identical journey and equal odds of success of winning a customer during a sales process. Also assume that the winning company gains a small advantage from that win: ability to hire a person, raise more capital or generate more revenue. The math shows that the outcomes will follow a power law. There will be one company that wins most of the market. The book also says that if one has a slight advantage, they should try to accelerate things as much as possible. In other words, raise as much money to hire sales executives to touch as many customers. This will reinforce their advantage and further accelerate the power law. Page uses a basketball analogy. If one team is even slightly better than another, that team should play faster. More possessions means more shots on the basket, which should drive greater disparity in the score at the end of the game. The second interesting topic was the structure of social networks. There are four types of social networks: random, geographic, power-law and small world networks. Each one has different properties. If you’re looking to leverage social networks for distribution/virality or some other component of your product, it’s worthwhile to understand the nuances and the ideal type of network to engender to maximize success. There’s another chapter on Markov Models. I fell in love with Markov Models in grad school. If you want to model how to load passengers into aircraft or decide how to layout a checkout (single lines with many registers or many lines with many registers), you can use Markovs. All of these mental models have assumptions and limitations but exploring them and knowing them is another set of powerful tools to think through business strategy.

It’s time to start SaaS Office Hours again! Starting on May 14, I’ll be hosting a monthly event from the Redpoint San Francisco offices called SaaS Office Hours. During these two hours, we will discuss the tactical issues and questions facing seed and Series A SaaS companies in a small group. That’s why we call them Office Hours. We’ve done them in the past and they’ve been a great success. Rather than deliver presentations, SaaS Office Hours are meant to be casual, tactical and collaborative. Sometimes, we’ll invite guests for off-the-cuff conversations and Q&A focused on focused questions like how should I build my startup’s marketing team? How can I evangelize my product to developers? How do I create the right kind of recruiting process? In the past, we’ve welcomed guests Pete Koomen (founder of Optimizely), Kenny van Zant (architect of the flywheel GTM), Bill Macaitis (CMO at Zendesk and Slack), and Maia Josebachvilli (head of people at Stripe). On May 14, we’ll welcome Travis Bryant ! Travis is a former VP at Salesforce, SVP Sales at Optimizely, and Head of Customer Growth at Front. With Travis, we’ll talk about go-to-market for early stage companies. How to plan and build it. What to look for in your first GTM hires. And why you should consider calling your CRO or VPS something different. You can also ask him for some advice on parenting newborns! Sign up for Office Hours here . Demand for these events often exceeds our hosting capacity, so we will email confirmations a week or two before the event. A quick note about SaaS Office Hours: these events are in person, so please register only if you are certain you can attend. Our goal is to create an intimate environment for founders and executives to network and learn from the SaaS world’s leading experts in different fields. We’ll continue to experiment with the program over time. If you have feedback, suggestions or ideas, please email me using the link on the top right of this page.

Since writing The AI Agency: A Novel GTM for Machine Learning Startups , I’ve been meeting many companies who operate this way. These startups use machine learning to disrupt an industry traditionally dominated by agencies: law, accounting, recruiting, translation, debt collection, marketing…the list is long. I will publish a landscape soon on the area. If you’re operating an AI Agency, I’d love to hear from you. In meeting many of these innovative businesses, I’ve observed they face four strategic questions. First, to sell to the agency or to be the agency? This is an early strategic question, perhaps the first strategic question an AI Agency will face. Many startups start out selling to agencies and then run into a wall. Classic agencies don’t value the software enough to engender pricing power, develop fast sales cycles, or change the operations of their business to maximize the value of the ML innovation. In some cases, agencies sell their time. Increases in productivity don’t imply increases in revenue. Other times, agencies prefer to operate they’ve always done. Consequently, product market fit is weak. It’s possible to build a business, but hard to achieve lift-off.  At that point, do you continue the business you have or compete with your customers? Most of the successful startups decide to compete with their customers by building an agency. Rather, they masquerade as an agency with a completely different engine, one powered by algorithms. The combination results in a larger market size with better gross margins than a classic agency. Second, how to price the product relative to the competition? At the outset, many AI Agencies price at a substantial discount to the market for two reasons. Gathering training data is critical and more valuable than initial revenue dollars. They market their technology as differentiation and buyers approach the business with some skepticism, also pushing down the price. These are two short term pricing headwinds. Ultimately, AI Agencies should price at comparable levels or even at a premium. And they ought to develop that pricing power. They will provide higher quality, more consistent work products faster than the competition. Third, how to employ the labor force? There are four models: as full time employees, as channel partners, as customer employees, or in a true marketplace. There is no consistent pattern across the startups I’ve met in their decision. Some hire full time employees to accomplish primarily to control the end-to-end user experience for very high quality. Some go to market with channel partners (BPOs, consulting agencies, marketing agencies) who benefit from the technology, sell into an existing customer base and provide a skill that the agency is unwilling to furnish themselves. Still others create a skilled labor market place of individual contractors who complete the work. The last group uses a team within the customer to work the software. There is no pattern primarily because each industry has its own evolution and dynamics that govern it. This labor force question is an important one. It impacts margin, ability to generate feedback data to improve ML models and sales processes. It’s worth testing and figuring out. Many AI Agencies start with one model and then migrate to a second. Last, what is the optimal type of AE: familiar with the domain or familiar with the technology? Across the companies I’ve met, more seem to succeed with AEs from the domain. Relationships matter most in agency sales. Buyers either love or hate their agencies. This bipolar nature of the relationship reinforces the benefit of AEs with existing relationships who should ramp faster and drive sales quicker. In addition, many AI agencies focus on enterprise accounts to drive higher ACVs. This strategy is consistent with the trade of lower gross margins for greater TAM compared to a software vendor. Hiring more senior AEs follows this upmarket strategy. In this novel GTM, these strategic questions seem to be the most important strategic questions. Different paths will lead to business models, data aggregation and margin structures than can differ significantly. If you’re building one of these businesses and have a comment or another point of view, please contact me. Photo by Victor Garcia on Unsplash

In a world where there are no secrets, where innovations are quickly imitated or become obsolete, the theory of competitive advantage may have had its day. Realistically, ask yourself, If all your competitors gave their strategic plans to each other, would it really make a difference? In 1986, Amar Bhide wrote “ Hustle as Strategy ” for the Harvard Business Review. At the time, he was an assistant professor at HBS. He examined the dynamics within the financial services market. Why was Goldman Sachs earning so much in profits relative to its peers? It’s not a powerful new strategy that a new leader infuses into the organization. Instead, it’s about focus and hustle. Opportunities to gain lasting advantage through blockbuster strategic moves are rare in any business. What mostly counts are vigor and nimbleness. Finance, like many other industries, and many software segments, sells a commodity. What differentiates the best banks from the middle of the pack aren’t differentiated financial products or novel go-to-market strategies or new insights into the market. As soon as one innovates, another copies - potentially with a year or two. The only way to make the vision real is through superior execution. That’s the key. It’s the resulting hustle that outlasts product cycles and wins against unremitting competition. How did these businesses compete? First, they focused on handful of key metrics. One manager, responsible for a remarkable turnaround in American banking, attributes much of his success to “a very rigorous and steady management review process, which was one of the hardest things that was put in, and which was done right in the beginning. Every month we sit down with every division and review where we stand against goals" Second, they hired for hustle and instituted great training programs that balanced operations with marketing. My partner Alex often shares the advice Marc Benioff gave him: “great businesses are formed at the Venn diagram intersection of a great product and equally great go to market.” In addition, the most senior people at the firms were responsible for recruiting. In many SaaS categories as well as in venture capital, this idea is absolutely true. Great execution is a winning strategy. And that starts with a focus on metrics and hiring the right people.

Why does growth rate matter so much? Why does growth rate influence valuation so much? I was reading a book recently written by a hedge fund manager who discussed valuation frameworks . His explanation was one of the best I’ve come across. If your business is growing at 100% next year, then 90% the year after, and then about 80% the year after, the business will have grown 6.9x. That’s the way I’ve always looked at company. But this hedge fund investor said it a different way: 85% of the value of the business will be created in the next 3 years.  At 10% growth, the company’s value today is 77% of the value in three years. The value won’t change that much. It’s already the most of the size it will be. Same cup, same water, just a different perspective. The chart above shows how this changes with different growth rates. It assumes a company starts growing at the growth rate on the y-axis. This growth rate falls 10% each year. On the x-axis, you can see the fraction of the enterprise value (EV) that will be created in the next 3 years. Instead of looking at today’s valuations as a multiple of current revenues, we can think about it as a discount to the future value. This math makes that perspective concrete.

In 2014, I published a post called Do Startup Require Less Capital to Succeed than 10 Years Ago ? It’s been five years and time to see how things have changed. In the analysis, I created a metric, the return on invested capital (ROIC). ROIC is the number of revenue dollars that one venture dollar bought. In other words, at IPO, how much revenue per VC dollar did the company generate. In 2014 we saw increasing efficiencies over time, which was very exciting because it reaffirmed the efficiency of SaaS go-to-market. The chart above updates that analysis. As a reminder, the bars represent the ROIC for 4 year buckets starting in the year marked on the x-axis. Startups going public from 2006-2009 showed a median ROIC of 0.42. One venture dollar bought forty-two cents at IPO. In 2010, one venture dollar bought $1.24 of revenue at IPO. If we look at the ROIC across IPOs across the last 12 years or so, we see that same initial dynamic of incredibly efficient companies in the 2010 and 2014 IPO cohorts. But the efficiency is declining, markedly. There are a few reasons for this. First, availability of capital. The era after 2006 and through the 2008 financial crisis was a different time to raise capital. It was harder. You needed to do more with less. As the amount of private capital has increased, so has the median amount raised before IPO. It’s tripled from about $92m to more than $300M since 2010. With more capital, startups can take more risk, explore more customer acquisition channels (some which may not work), develop more products and potentially grow faster. And the financial market has met the need many times over, with bigger checks at larger valuations. Because of the surfeit of capital, SaaS startups face increasing competition and monotonically increasing costs of customer acquisition , increasing their capital consumption; to say nothing of increasing wages in San Francisco and across the US. And that’s borne out in the data. SaaS companies go public later. The median revenue at IPO has increased from $55m in 2006 to $200m in 2018-2019. That’s quite a jump! At least 2 more years of operation, likely 3-4 more years, which implies something like $75m-$150m more in opex. ROIC has declined a certain extent. It’s partly due to more competitive market dynamics, partly due to an ability to raise larger amounts of capital, and partly due to the desire to go public at greater revenue scale. None of these trends is a negative implication necessarily. The figures highlight the changing market dynamics created by an 11 year bull market in software and the ability of startups to experiment more, hire more to grow as quickly as possible; which is the most attractive thing to investors in today’s market.

In early and developing markets, selling complete products is often a superior go to market strategy, rather than selling an innovation in a layer in the stack. This is true for five reasons. First , for early customers to generate value from a novel technology, that technology must solve a business problem completely. End-to-end products do that. Layers in the stack don’t. They optimize existing systems. In early markets, customers want to buy a car, not a better camshaft. Second , in early markets, most of the buyers don’t understand the nuances of the technology, whether it’s IoT platforms, or machine learning infrastructures, or data lakes. Everything is brand-new. So differentiating on one layer of the stack or a different feature  within a layer doesn’t matter to the buyer. Why is a Kafka stream better than a Rabbit message queue? Unless you have operated large-scale internal data pipelines, you may not have the experience to discern the pros and cons of each. Similarly, until the broader market has enough experience running large-scale big data systems, the market demand for a superior data movement layer will be small. Third , by building an end-to-end products you’ll capture much more of the upside - at least 5x more. Imagine you have just written machine learning model that prices stocks better than anything else in the market. Which will generate more value: selling that machine learning model to existing public market investors, or starting a hedge fund? The answer is starting hedge fund. By starting a hedge fund, you’ll be able to capture more of the value. You’ll earn 100% of the gains, plus build equity value in the business. If you sell the software, you might get 20% of the gains; the remainder goes to your customers. Fourth , you reinforce competitive advantage. Keeping the technology to yourself prevents anyone else from using it, learning about it and developing a better system. Fifth , you control the sales process. If you sell a layer in the stack, you will rely on partners, those adjacent to you in the stack, to go to market. Alliances and channel partners will be critical to your success. You sell through or with someone else. If you build an end to end product, you can go directly to the customer, get feedback and iterate faster. Not every market will work this way. But on the whole, selling end to end products in early market enables startups to influence the market, capture more of the value, and ensure greater success with their initial customers as they create the category.

In the past few years, Zoom has become a verb: the act of video conferencing someone. Eight years ago, Eric Yuan, former VP Engineering at WebEx left to create a business with a better video conferencing product. He and his team authored a new codec, which is far more resilient than others. The innovation results in higher quality calls. Focused on capital efficiency from the earliest days of the business, Eric has built a monster software business, with few comparisons in both absolute scale and efficiency. The company filed their S-1 on Friday. The company grew from $61m to $331m in revenue in the past three years. Zoom, growing at 148% and 119% in ‘18 and ‘19. Let’s put Zoom’s growth rates into context by comparing them to others within similar ACV ranges. Even at Zoom’s scale, across this peer set, Zoom is the fastest growing, edging New Relic by 5 percentage points. In addition to the terrific growth rate, Zoom has grown profitably with 2% net income margin recorded last year. Only Atlassian and Fleetmatics have charted similar numbers in the year of the IPO. One key driver of profitability is labor-market arbitrage. Nearly one third of Zoom’s team, and the majority of its engineering team is based in China. The result is the company spends less than 10% of its revenue on R&D, which is less than half the median of the peer set. In addition to reduced labor costs, Zoom benefits from a 1.8 sales efficiency, meaning one dollar of sales and marketing spend results  in $1.80 of gross profit in the next year. This is second to Atlassian. This math also implies a payback period, gross margin burdened, of less than 7 months. The public median is 18 months and the private median is 14 months. These customer acquisition paybacks resemble consumer acquisition figures more than software. If we examine net dollar retention, the current value of last year’s cohort today net of churn and gross of expansion, we see Zoom is in the top decile at 140%. In other words, customers who started paying Zoom last year pay 40% more this year, including the ones who have attrited. These metrics are the result of exceptional product market fit. Exceptionally fast and efficient growth define Zoom, the next iconic video conferencing platform. Expect this business to fetch stellar multiples, most likely similar to Atlassian because the revenue, growth rates, sales efficiency and profitability metrics are comparable. Congratulations to the team!

Imagine-75 years ago-our Commencement date was listed as January 1, 1943. Our “last supper” date was December 12, 1942. It was in the main dining room. President Hopkins and Arthur Hayes Sulzberger, president and publisher of the New York Times, were the keynote speakers. No pomp, no valedictorian, no honorary degrees, no cap and gown, no family. The dinner ended with hugs and tears eyes. We scattered in different directions the next morning. We were facing World War II in its darkest moments…91% of the class was headed for the armed forces. I went to a college that publishes a monthly magazine and sends it to graduates every month. In the back of the magazine, there’s a section that lists updates from alumni  grouped by the year of graduation. As I read the latest issue, I found this paragraph on the first page of those alumni updates. It was written by one of the surviving members of the class of 1943, who must be in their 90s. When I was in college, my grandfather died. I went to Europe to spend a few weeks with my grandmother, and she shared with me the diary my great-grandfather wrote throughout WWII. My ancestor wrote it in Polish, my grandmother translated it to French, and I to English. In that process, I felt an immense sense of the smallness of my worldview, of the triviality of my challenges, of gratitude for all the sacrifice and hardship our families endured. Like many millions of others across innumerable conflicts, our family’s history has stories of tragedy and horror and narrow escapes. As a great founder once told me, “Most of the challenges in our lives are puzzles, not problems.” Reading the note from the graduate of 1943, I was brought back to transcribing the journal and I remembered how very grateful I am to be solving puzzles.

PagerDuty was founded in 2009 by 3 former Amazon engineers who were often on-call. To engineers, being on call means carrying a pager to respond to crises when software breaks or services go down. In the 10 years since that day, PagerDuty has built an exceptional business. Their product has evolved from on-call management, which includes routing calls, triaging alerts, and creating workflows to handle crises in real time; to an incident management platform that manages the standard operating procedures for responding to crises; to real-time operations dashboards that provide visibility and health scores for infrastructure. On Friday, the company published its S-1 and revealed to the world a very strong business. the company generated $107M of trailing 12 month revenue, services 33% of the Fortune 500, grew revenue at 48% and has a net retention rate of 139% across 10,800 customers. The average customer is worth about $10,000. Let’s compare PagerDuty to other recent software IPOs for companies selling to engineers at their IPO. Let’s first look at one of the key SaaS metrics: the dollar retention. This is the value of a cohort a year later inclusive of churn and expansion.  PagerDuty is at 139%, which puts it smack in the midst of an exceptional group. According to the recent Redpoint free trial survey, the 140% net retention puts the business in the top decile of businesses. Next, let’s compare the sales efficiency. Sales efficiency is a measure of the marginal gross profit generated by a dollar invested in sales and marketing. Here we can see that Atlassian is off the charts, with their super-efficient market model. PagerDuty is again right in the midst of everyone else at 70%. Looking at gross margin, which is the revenue minus the cost of goods sold (typically hosting costs and customers success), PagerDuty tops the list of 85%. This is substantially above the publicly traded median of 71%, Which again reinforces a very capital efficient go to market. In terms of price point, PagerDuty is right around the $10,000 revenue per customer per year. In the last year, the number of customers generating more than $100,000 per year in revenue nearly doubled to 203 from 132 the period before. This is likely due to a combination of moving upmarket and also the terrific account expansion. A typical account starting at $10,000 will exceed $100,000 in seven years at today’s NDR. In terms of revenue growth at IPO, PagerDuty is on the lower end of this exceptional group, but the combination of the terrific NDR and very capital efficient sales and marketing means PagerDuty will continue to be a very successful business. Congratulations to the PagerDuty team on building an impressive business. Comparing the metrics to other world-class companies, we can see that PagerDuty’s metrics are clearly the top decile, and represent another fantastic software IPO. *This post has an updated sales efficiency chart. The previous reported Twilio’s sales efficiency incorrectly.

Rewind a decade. Angel investing was an important part of the Startupland ecosystem. Today, you can’t make the same argument. 2018 observed the fewest number of angel-led financing rounds since before 2010. Angels led 156 rounds last year, a figure that collapsed from 714 in 2015. In that same time period, the median angel round has fallen from $500k to $270k. And the total number of dollars invested by angels halved from a peak of $365M to $177M. Angel investing used to account for nearly one-quarter of the dollars at the very first round. Today, it’s 4.3%, an 81% decline. What’s happening to the very earliest stages of the fund raising market? The answer? Institutional seed has come to dominate the first round of capital. It’s massively outstripped any growth in angel investing, growing from about $0.5B annually to just about $4B in 8 years. Seed fund checks are larger than angel checks, which corroborate what we all observe to be the case: valuations and round sizes at the very earliest stages are rising. Institutional seed funds might respond to this trend by writing bigger checks, raising bigger funds, raising opportunity funds or concentrating their portfolios. Angel investors, on the other hand, seem either to be walking away, or raising an institutional seed fund of their own. This pattern is broadly true across the top six states by angel round dollars, but Georgia and Colorado are bucking the trend to some extent. Look at Georgia - a sign of things to come or an anomaly, I wonder. What does this mean for startupland? Startup investing is no longer a cottage industry. It’s formalized, a standalone asset class deploying $100B a year. And the earliest stages are no exception. As one of my partners told me recently, venture investing in the valley started with six men who would lunch on Thursdays and syndicate investing because none could write a big enough check to cover a round on their own. We’re a long way from a white linen tablecloth lunch at a San Francisco oyster bar. And the implications for startups? It means that angels, while still an important part of the ecosystem, represent a small and shrinking share of investors who will lead your first round. You’re 20x more likely to raise your seed round from an institutional seed than an angel syndicate.

A founder posed me a question earlier this week: Do you have any data/perspective on whether it’s worth keeping the unassisted free trial flow vs. providing only one path which leads to a demo and an assisted free trial? This is a complex question. Let’s break it down. The unassisted free trial has benefits. There’s a deeper discussion in this post: Confessions of a Perpetual Freeloader . You capture the buyer at the point of maximum intent and reduces the activation energy of the sale . You broaden the universe of people who try the product. You educate the market on your product. You establish longer term relationships with customers since they can engage with the brand and product earlier on in their journey. You create barriers to entry by reducing the cost of customer acquisition and inhibit newer competitors who might disrupt using this acquisition strategy. There are also costs. Unassisted free trial accounts are likely to be smaller. Many more prospects will email customer support, which can be expensive. It requires a more mature product. Salespeople can gloss over faults and holes in the product during a demo. A solo user is bound to find bugs and rough edges and that can damage your brand. A brand is the sum total of all the interactions a customer has with your company. It may also require dividing the product roadmap because you might serve two different customer segments. The SMBs might prefer unassisted conversion and the enterprise assisted. This has some downstream effects.* Where do startups run into trouble? When the unassisted and the assisted flows target the same customer base and price point. Salespeople spend time with small accounts which challenge the unit economics and quota attainment. And very large customers don’t get the attention they warrant. To be able to sustain both paths, your company and product should be able to create a fork in the road to divide customers. You should have a pricing plan that clearly separates the customers that will close by themselves at a lower price from those that will pay more but ask/require sales help. How do you create this fork in the road? Some ask customers to identify which type of customer they are and they are treated differently. Others use lead scoring or enrichment technologies to suss out which flow a customer should pursue. Others may create different landing pages and flows to segment the customer base. And of course, you could treat everyone the same and wait until you get a call from a big customer who wants to buy a broader license: the flywheel model . To summarize, running both strategies is better, but it’s more work. The key to managing that complexity is having a team that can serve both customers, that can segment the customers well, and a pricing model that makes the unit economics work. This is a complex topic and I’ve tried to generalize to simplify it. I’m sure I’m overlooking some important facets. If you have another perspective, please write or tweet. I’d love to hear it. *Unassisted free trial creates PQLs (product qualified leads) and assisted free trials create MQLs or SQLs (marketing or sales qualified leads). These differences are important because they require differences in focus. To create a successful PQL conversion process, product and engineering and growth marketing work together to optimize a conversion funnel. Prospects move down the conversion funnel by using the product and by receiving emails or in product alerts to educate. On the other hand, to create a successful MQL/SQL funnel requires marketing support, sales execution and customer success.

Last week, the dynamic Harry Stebbings and I recorded episode 213 of the Saastr podcast , where we discussed the learnings from the free trial survey in a bit more detail . Harry’s a wonderful interviewer, and moves effortlessly from topic to topic. I made him laugh once later in the show when I told him about the last book I read. Normally, he’s the one making me laugh. Discussing the results with Harry, the data that is the most baffling to me remains the activity scoring data. In that analysis, the data showed lead scoring was ineffective at lower price points and negatively correlated with conversion rate at higher price points. As I said on the show, my hypothesis is that buyers in the upper price points may poke around in the product once or twice, and still buy. In contrast, trial-ers of  0-5k ACV software may use the product much more because the buyer is the user. The part I can’t overcome is I studied machine learning and our teams used it at Google to great success. Many of the startups I work with use machine learning successfully. ML works. Why doesn’t it seem to work in this case?! If anyone has a hypothesis, I’m keen to hear it. Given all the interest in this data and the wonderful response to it, we’ll be publishing more surveys like these. Also, this post is a milestone posts. It’s the 1000th post on tomtunguz.com. Thanks for the support and the time.

I remember the first time I visited China. We landed around 11pm local time in Beijing in the midst of the summer heat wave. As we landed, humidity fogged the Boeing’s windows, and the runway lights projected mirages from the haze. I could have sworn that heat was the product of a billion people’s fervent labor to advance their country and pull themselves into a new era. Since that trip, when I visited RenRen, Autonavi and a few other blossoming startups, the Chinese startup ecosystem has grown tremendously. Chinese startups raise nearly half of all venture capital dollars and nearly 100 are valued at $1B . Kai-Fu Lee’s book, AI Superpowers , provides some of the best history and perspective on the Chinese startup ecosystem I’ve read. Dr. Lee was President of Google China, and has held executive roles at Microsoft, Apple and SGI, among other places. He’s a venture capitalist in China and knows the ecosystem well. There are two ideas in the book that will remain with me. The first is his view of the influence of machine learning in the world. The second are his descriptions of the fierce competitive dynamics in China. On machine learning, The AI world order will combine winner-take-all economics with an unprecedented concentration of wealth in the hands of a few companies in China and the US…China’s data advantage extends from quantity to quality. The country’s massive number of Internet users- greater that the US and Europe combined- gives it the quantity…Unlike American companies which gather data about online interactions, Chinese companies gather data about the physical world. This quote spans a few chapters but I wove it together to make a few key points. First, the book embraces the idea that machine learning creates monopolies based on data aggregation. Second, China will have more data. Third, Chinese data captures a greater fraction of human behavior. More of it measures the physical world because the Chinese internet blossomed first on mobile in a wave called O2O, online to offline. On startup competition, Chinese founders differ from their US counterparts in that the Chinese entrepreneurs what Dr. Lee dubs “gladiator entrepreneurs.” As we enter the age of AI implementation, this cutthroat entrepreneurial environment will be one of China’s core assets in building a machine learning economy…In my view, the willingness to get one’s hands dirty in the real world separates Chinese technology companies from their Silicon Valley peers. The book argues startups in the US prefer to solve problems with software rather than with people or by moving atoms, and casts them in the light of operators as armchair generals, compared to Chinese founders who are infantry. For example, the competition in the Chinese ecosystem exemplified by the War of a Thousand Groupons in the mid-2010s in which hundreds of GroupOn clones fought for survival first by vying to acquire the most customers at the lowest margins and then to establish competitive barriers to entry via diversification, created Meituan , a $ 320B conglomerate that’s less than 4 years old. The book argues a piquant point of view and one that deserves to be read and considered. To me, the Chinese and US startup ecosystems differ because of their history. One started with PCs and laptops, the other with mobile phones. One began with expensive labor and the other with inexpensive labor (and this is the reason for the differences in go-to-market approaches mentioned above; many Chinese strategies are simply too expensive to pursue in the US, hence the obsession with the leverage software provides). One has a government that has embraced - until recently - laissez faire policies toward technology, while the other has a government investing enormous sums to accelerate technology and entrepreneurialism. Success in technology is a national priority for China. AI Superpowers shares the Chinese startup history and provides a contrast between that ecosystem and the US, and is a starting point for good debate about how we should think about the next 20 years of startups: in a far more global context than at any time in the past.

When I was a teenager, I read many books about Dr. Richard Feynman. The irreverent but kind Nobel prize winner in physics became famous for his contributions to quantum mechanics. Though I’ve never understood quantum mechanics all that well, I’ve always admired Feynman, like many others. To read Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman is to hear about his upbringing in Queens, New York, where as a boy Feynman teaches himself advanced math, plays practical jokes and fixes radios during the Great Depression to help neighbors, and impresses all of them with his intellect. He wrote many books which weave his personal history into historical events like the Manhattan Project and the Challenger disaster investigation. In each, he played a pivotal role. And throughout some serious times, including the loss of his first wife, Feynman displays a wonder of the world, an eagerness to play practical jokes, the will to speak his mind authentically, but kindly. He spends days experimenting with ants to understand exactly how they communicate where sugar lies. He creates paper ferries to relocated them and test their ability to deal with change. And he uses the results of those experiments to free his apartment from ants without injuring a single one. Over the weekend, I listened to a Feynman lecture . I’d read his voice and played in my head for hours reading all his book, but it was different to hear it. Here he was, one of the most sophisticated minds of our time, and he explained complex topics with ease. Students adored Feynman. And in watching the video, it’s easy to see why. He makes you laugh when talking about wave particle duality of electrons. He teaches you about the wonder he sees that drives him to love physics. He compares light waves and radio waves and gamma rays to a bug watching people jump into a pool and it all makes sense. Feynman worked hard to deliver these presentations. He writes letters to his family about them . That desire to teach and share and simplify engendered tremendous amounts of goodwill. When Feynman died, Caltech hosted two ceremonies on the same day, and both exceeded capacity. To take complex topics and simplify them in a way that invigorates people, that makes them dream and love the ideas; what a lasting and enduring gift. To me, Feynman is an inspiration, a model of someone who pushes the field forward and all the while gives back to the community. Despite his renown and fame and profound intellect, he was modest, even in accepting his Nobel. The Prize was a signal to permit [my friends] to express, and me to learn about, their feelings. Each joy, though transient thrill, repeated in so many places amounts to a considerable sum of human happiness. And, each note of affection released thus one upon another has permitted me to realize a depth of love for my friends and acquaintances, which I had never felt so poignantly before.

Startups are innovation machines. They identify market opportunities, develop novel products and go out to change the world. Some companies want to change the world in one dimension: a better product or a disruptive go-to-market. Others want to innovate in every dimension and re-invent every discipline from pricing to marketing to support to customer success. Brad Birnbaum, founder and CEO of Kustomer , discussed the challenges of innovating on two dimensions simultaneously on the Saastr podcast . Kustomer’s platform is a fundamental re-architecture of customer support software. That product innovation is novel and differentiated in the market. At the outset, Brad also sought to change the pricing model. So pricing’s a really difficult thing, right? It’s something that we wrestled with in the earliest days of Kustomer. We wanted to be innovative. We thought innovator pricing would be very important to us. We quickly learned as we started talking to customers that they didn’t want innovative pricing. They wanted repeatable, consistent pricing that mapped to the budget they already had in place. Now as we are going mid-market and above, we’re mostly replacing existing solutions, whether it be Zendesk or Salesforce. So they already had a budget in place, so they just said, “Hey, we have X amount allocated for a solution. Our solution is better, it’s robust, it does more, but this is the budget that we have.” So they wanted a pricing model that, frankly, mapped to the way they’re accustomed to doing business It was highly predictable. So while we wanted to think about doing a consumption model here at Kustomer, because we thought that was innovative, we realized our customers didn’t want a consumption model. Innovating in one dimension is already a challenge. You need to find customers who want it. Then you must hire the team who believes in it and can execute the plan. That’s hard enough. In Kustomer’s case, the product evolution is a hit and the company is achieving hypergrowth. But customers wanted the better product with the same pricing framework as the rest of the industry. Pricing and budget aren’t the customers’ pain point. Access to data and efficiency are. Innovating in many dimensions can slow sales cycles. If you have to describe first how your product is different and then educate your buyer on why the pricing is different, you may be hindering your champion, especially if the buyer doesn’t need innovation in pricing. Prioritizing how to differentiate in the market is a key aspect of product management. There are spaces where pricing innovation is welcome, especially when there is a large, expensive incumbent. In that case, a lower cost, less expensive competitor with a new pricing model may be highly disruptive. You’ll hear customers will complain about cost openly and may contort themselves to save money by reducing usage. Before changing pricing models, listen to customer perspectives on budget.

In Defense of Troublemakers . I love the title. Who doesn’t want to be a troublemaker? Charlan Nemeth is a professor at Berkeley of Psychology. She’s studied the role of dissent in group decision-making and written this book on the topic. It’s a critical part of a functioning team. Here’s what I learned from the book: The minority, dissenting opinion in an argument is essential to ensure we make the best decisions. When we are exposed to dissent, our thinking does not narrow as it does when we are exposed to consensus. In fact, dissent broadens our thinking. This is because dissenters often share a critical perspective or data point that the majority didn’t know or hasn’t considered. That “one piece of unique information could change the whole picture and the final decision” Importantly, dissenting opinions don’t have to be correct to improve the decision. Dissent breaks the blind following of the consensus and dissent stimulates thought that is more divergent. By exploring a problem space more broadly, a group makes a better decision. But dissent in a room must be genuine. Tools like playing Devil’s Advocate work only if the person playing Satan’s lawyer genuinely believes in the dissenting view or genuinely wants to explore the other argument. Creating a culture that actively encourages dissent is one of the hardest managerial challenges. Teammates must trust each other to be able to argue a minority position, and to feel confident enough to explore new angles, share new data points, and take the time to debate an issue, rather than simply agreeing with the majority. If you’re curious about the research and findings on dissent, and the techniques to foster more dissent within your team, this is a good book.

After publishing the survey last week, I received many questions. I’ve answered a few here. I’m happy the data has garnered so much interest and I hope it’s helping with our two goals of sharing benchmarks and sparking conversations about how to optimize trial. If you have stories or data that buttresses or contradicts any of these findings, please share them. I’d love to publish them here. Also, if you have ideas for future surveys like this, send them my way. Matt asked: Is there any meaningful difference in conversion or other metrics for companies in different ARR buckets? Not substantially. Chart below. There are some variances across ARR buckets. I would have expected companies in the $1M or less in ARR to observe lower conversion rates because they are earlier in their go-to-market development. Consequently, earlier startups might have a lower conversion baseline, whereas a business at $20M in ARR has spent several years optimizing trial. But statistical tests indicate that the differences in conversion rates aren’t meaningful. Jonathan asked: Can you share trial length by market segment? This was a good intuition. Enterprises tend to use longer free trials than their SMB counterparts. This may be due a perception that enterprise buyers navigate longer and more complex decision-making process. But the conversion rates across different trial lengths aren’t different to statistical significance. And can you show payment collected by ARR? The popularity of requiring payment is constant across ARR buckets. The only one that stands out is the $150M ARR bucket, but there weren’t many of those in the respondent set, so the result is skewed by a small sample set. Jason asked: when you wrote “require payment to start trial," does that mean collecting payment information or actually charging the card? I suspect the effect on the top of the funnel and the ultimate conversion rate is the same. But charging the card immediately would mean the trial wasn’t free! And if they did cancel the trial, you would have to credit accounts which could get tricky. Andrew asked: Does requiring payment have an impact on retention? And when is that conversion counted… is that on payment capture? Good question. We don’t have the data to answer it. Dustin asked: Was there any meaningful impact in combining free trial limiters? ie. a usage + time bound free trial model converting better than usage or time alone? We didn’t ask this in the survey, so I don’t have a good answer for this. Perhaps a useful question to ask in the future.

As you build out your startup’s financial model for 2019, a key component will be the hiring plan. You’ll need to calculate the number of managers and individual contributors to achieve your goals. But don’t forget to plan for mishires. You will make mistakes hiring people. We all do and it’s part of the process of building a company. Someone looks great on paper but isn’t a culture fit. Another doesn’t ramp quickly enough. A third might not have the work ethic. Whatever the reason, it will happen. In the hiring plan, you should anticipate this. Many startups plan to over-hire in sales, but not in other departments. Why is this? It’s because AE hiring is directly tied to bookings capacity and consequently growth. A mis-hire might cost the business $500k in ARR, which can be the difference between growing 2x and 2.5x at the early stages. So it matters. Overhiring in other GTM teams like customer support, customer success, sales engineering should be considered, especially if the company is on a steep ramp and hiring quickly; and the business has the balance sheet to support this hedging strategy. There’s no way to know exactly what fraction of hires won’t work out. Many businesses project 20% mis-hire rate, which is a good initial estimate. Whatever your estimate, take the time to think through over-hiring in the key GTM and support teams to ensure you’ll have the right capacity to support your growing customer base.

Before we’d leave campus - Christmas vacation or spring break or summer vacation - our rowing coach would tell us, “You’re either getting faster or you’re getting slower. There’s no such thing as staying the same.” It was his way of inspiring us to train hard during those times. I’ve never forgotten it. More recently I came across two math equations that confers the same idea, with a twist. The compounding effect of improving every day. What if you could improve how you do something by 1% each day for a year? You’d be 37x better. What if your performance declined by 1% every day for a year. You’d lose 97% of your performance. It’s a reminder that getting just a little bit better every day has dramatic effects in relatively short periods of time. To bastardize Einstein: Compounding improvement is the most powerful force in the universe.

Top 10 Learning about Free Trials from Tomasz Tunguz At Saastr yesterday, I presented the top 10 learnings from the Redpoint Free Trial Survey that we distributed in October. The data confirmed many rules of thumb but also raised some interesting new questions about the best way to use trials. When we distributed the survey, we never would have expected the response. About 600 companies submitted data. They span single digit ARR businesses to publicly traded SaaS companies. These businesses sell at every price point and sell to every operational buyer. From product to sales, from legal to marketing. We processed the data with 1000+ lines of R code to parse the insights from the data and test for statistical significance. In sharing the results, we have two goals Share benchmarks to calibrate your startup’s free trials Spark conversations about new free trial tests to run for your startup. Let’s jump into the list. Annual Contracts Dominate. Between 60-80% of respondents tie annual contracts to free trials. Annual contracts dominate in the mid-market. In the SMB, month to month is more common. In the enterprise, multi-year contracts emerge. As we dug into the data, we couldn’t find any meaningful difference in free trial conversion based on contract length. So, stick to annual contracts unless you have a good reason to diverge. Aim for 90%+ Logo Retention. More than one-third of respondents retain 90% or more of their customers by count one year after acquiring them. Higher rates of customer retention are more common in the mid-market and enterprise. Target 100-140% Net Dollar Retention. The top quartile of respondents observe net dollar retention of 120%+. The top decile grow at 140%. Startups targeting enterprises typically see better NDR than those targeting smaller accounts. Time and Usage Based Free Trials Convert Better. There are four ways to limit trial. Usage: 500 of API calls, then upgrade. Seats: first two seats free. Time: 30 day trial. Feature: upgrade for better security. Time and Usage based trials have at least 2x the conversion rates. Conversion Rates Aren’t Impacted by Trial Length. Shorten Trial Length. Most companies employ 14 day trial. But all time-bound free trials convert at the same rate. Salespeople Increase Conversion by 3.5x+. 75% of respondents employ salespeople to call upon prospects. This is true across every price point. Target 4%+ Unassisted Conversion. The 50th percentile of respondents convert 4% of leads to paying customers, when the conversion is unassisted (doesn’t involve a salesperson). Target 15%+ Assisted Conversion. The 50th percentile convert 15.5% of free trial leads to paying customers when assisted by a salesperson. Scoring Leads by Activity May Lead to False Conclusions. Many companies use activity data to score leads. How frequently someone uses the product, how many people were invited etc. The data suggests activity scoring may be disqualifying good leads because bigger buyers exhibit different usage patterns before buying. Requiring payment Increases Conversion Rate by 2.5x. Only 12% of respondents require payment to start trial. The others bet that by filling the top of the funnel with more leads and getting data on prospective leads is a better trade. The data suggests it’s worth testing payment requirement for mid-market and SMB price points. Thank you to everyone who participated in the survey, and in particular to my colleague Patrick Chase. If you have questions or observations about this data, please email me or send me a tweet.

The first wave of SaaS is 20 years old. Today, the SaaS model dominates. But we’re seeing the emergence of a different type of next-generation software company. A new wave of companies that is responding to the changing needs of customers by innovating their architecture. Very simply, they liberate the database from the application. In license software, the database ran alongside the application on-prem. In SaaS, the database runs next to the application in the cloud. But what if you freed customers from this constraint, and gave the customer the choice of where to run each? Suddenly, the customer is in control of their data in a way they never can be with SaaS. Customers can choose where to host the database, how to secure it, monitor it, ensure it complies with new data privacy regulations, limit access, and service it. They can run it in their cloud, in a VPC or on premises. Meanwhile, the application is delivered as any other SaaS app. It’s updated just as quickly. Even better when the app is open source. Customers can audit the code, fork it to customize it, and embed it wherever. We’ve been looking for companies building software this way. Today, I’m thrilled to announce our investment in and partnership with Mattermost . Mattermost embodies this new wave of software companies. They deliver open source messaging to secure enterprises and DevOps teams. They work with Uber, USAA, Department of Defense, ING, Bristol Meyers, Virgin, Samsung and many others. We’ve spent a long time getting to know Ian and the terrific team at Mattermost. In that time, we’ve been impressed by three things. First, the recognition by the most demanding teams that this new data architecture satisfies their requirements. Second, how this model has propelled the business to far larger revenue than typical at a Series A. Third, the explosive distribution of open source also applies at the application tier, not just infrastructure. If you’re a developer looking for a high performance, secure messenger, or you work in an enterprise that values control over data, give it a whirl .

As you start to go to market, there are two things to prioritize from early customers that matter more than cash. Feedback and marketing rights. The feedback matters for obvious reasons. The product is early; customer feedback will help you hew the raw granite of your initial product into shape. The second may not be so obvious. Every prospect championing a software purchase will be asked by the opponents of the sale and decision-makers : “Who else is using the software?” The more impressive your customer list, the stronger the case your champion can extol. Logos confer credibility. Software vendors are in the business of selling promotions . And the best way to fight the inertia in sales is to equip your champions . Social proof is one of the strongest influences for buyers and best ways to defeat the preference for buyers to continue as they are. There is safety in conformity. That’s why logos are worth more than cash. If you negotiate the rights to market some great customer brands, you’ll be able to use them in every sales process, in every press release, in every recruiting conversation. That’s worth much more than cash and larger bookings in the early days. A great customer logo slide is like a bank account. It compounds its value with time. Great brands attract other great brands. Be sure to invest early in those logos, even at the material expense of bookings.

Late last year, my colleague Pat Chase and I announced the Redpoint Free Trial SaaS Survey . Over the course of a few weeks, we received roughly 600 responses from SaaS startups who use these marketing techniques. They span companies from $1M in ARR to more than $100M. The respondents sold into every key function of a business and at all different price points. On February 5 at 10am, I’ll be sharing the top 10 learnings from the survey at Saastr . After the conference, I’ll post the slides with the conclusions here. This is the first time we’ve run a large scale survey. We were surprised in three ways. The first is the amount of responses; we were stunned by the volume of data and willingness to share. Thank you to everyone who contributed. Second, it takes quite a bit of work to analyze the data, far more than I expected. We wrote more than 1000 lines of code to identify the ways startups use free trials. We cut the data by contract size, target buyer, free trial structure, and many other dimensions. Then we tested the results for statistical significance to ensure we’re pointing startups in the right direction. Third, the data suggests that some of the common knowledge about free trials is correct. And some of it deserves more testing. But that most of the conclusions apply across a broad base of startups. I’m excited to share more soon. Photo by Capturing the human heart. on Unsplash

It’s very difficult question to answer. How do you judge a leader? Is it financial success? The loyalty they engender? Their ability to inspire? There are war-time leaders and peace-time leaders. Leaders may be understated or zealous. I’m not sure we’ll ever be able to say definitively what constitutes a great leader. Regardless, we all want to improve our ability to lead, whether it’s a small team or a Fortune 500. But how? One way of looking at leadership development is through Adult Development Theory, an idea pioneered by Dr. Robert Kegan , a developmental psychologist at Harvard that borrows from others in the field. Adult development theory has five stages. The first two we develop in childhood: impulsive mind and imperial mind. The next three we learn in adulthood. I’ve put together a quick summary below. For greater depth, there’s a good overview here . Socialized Mind (most adults): we have built relationships with our team  and those social connections influence our ideas the most. We see ourselves the way others see us and look for external validation from others about how we’re doing as leaders. Self-Authoring Mind (some adults): we shift from validating ourselves in the eyes of others to establishing an internal sense of self, and begin to direct ourselves independently. We have limits, values, goals and drive that comes from within, and those govern our leadership. Self-Transforming Mind (very few adults): we’re able to balance both the perspectives of others with our our sense of self-direction. Tricky business! If I think about the style of management epitomized by Steve Jobs (or at the least the public perception of his management style), he would be in the self-authoring mind, caring very little for others’ perspectives. Reading some books including Creative Selection, I’m sure Jobs’ style was more nuanced. Jennifer Garvey Berger applies this framework to leadership . In her view, great leaders make those around them feel bigger, bolder and able to do great things. A charismatic leader, on the other hand, awes you and so you feel better about the leader, not you. Simon Sinek likens leadership to falling in love with someone. Every day we perform simple habits of true compassion and living by our values. That’s how we become leaders in others’ eyes. Both believe the core of leadership starts with listening and then being able to balance the external points of view with a strong sense of self (values, direction, belief). Maybe that’s why leadership is so hard to evaluate. It all comes down to judging many opinions including our own and managing relationships well after the decisions are made. This framework got me thinking about where I am in the Adult Development Theory. Kegan said that we all see ourselves one step ahead in development of where we actually are. Where are you? Where do you want to get to? Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash

Over the weekend, the NY Times interviewed a classmate of mine from Dartmouth and fellow oarsman on the freshman crew team, Cal Newport, about his book and his idea, Deep Work . Here’s the crux of the idea: Deep work is my term for the activity of focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It describes, in other words, when you’re really locked into doing something hard with your mind…In order for a session to count as deep work there must be zero distractions. Even a quick glance at your phone or email inbox can significantly reduce your performance due to the cost of context switching. The costs of switching and of interruptions is real. The typical American worker is interrupted every 210 seconds. But half of those interruptions are self-interruptions. If we check our phones every 12 minutes or 70 times per day , the question is how much deep work can we do? The longer I work in technology, the more I value long blocks of uninterrupted time. It’s probably the scarcest resource at work. When is the last time you had 90 minutes to work on a project without an interruption: a phone call, a text message, an email, a buzz or a ring or a knock? In a different book Make Time by two Googlers, Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky introduce the infinity pool. The infinity pool is technology that deliberately devours as much of your time as possible. We all have these insatiable monsters in our pockets. They are boredom cures, fixes for dopamine desire, triggered by a two minute YouTube video, a quick Fortnight campaign, a voyeur’s social media blitz. In Make Time, the authors advise you not to wait for technology to give you back your time. Because it won’t. There are PhDs in every discipline learning how to take it from you. The authors advocate extreme measures to combat the algorithms using our predilections for newness against us. Delete all infinity pools from your phone. It’s an interesting experiment, but I’m not ready to go that far. Instead, I installed an app that recorded each time I activated my phone, and challenged myself to reduce it touches from about 40 to about 20 times per day, which I thought was great. But then I realized, that’s still more than once per hour. A long way to go. They also push for checking email once per day, which might be possible in some work environments, but definitely not for me. Deep work is the most satisfying work. I like to write early in the morning because then I have the luxury of uninterruptedness. I’m sure we all know that feeling. We can make real progress in short periods of time; we’re at our intellectual peak. We have to defend it, first by being aware of the challenges impeding our focus.

Your startup is growing quickly. To hit next year’s target, you may need to hire many people. Where do you start? Bottoms up or top down? Both are viable strategies, but hiring a strong management team at every level provides some key benefits. First, they help you hire more effectively. Second, they will guide new additions to the team to success. Third, they will reduce unnecessary turnover. As you grow, your company well need to interview and hire large numbers of new people. Managers help this by bringing their own network , spending 30-50 percent of their time interviewing and recruiting, and will on board these new hires successfully As you grow, you’ll want to keep all these great people. it is very expensive to recruit. Keeping the span of control to 7 or 8 ensures each employee has enough mentorship and leadership to thrive. This means for every 32 people, you’ll need at least 5 managers assuming one doesn’t work out. Managers and leaders often recruit lieutenants from their previous work experience. When hiring a leader in an existing team, it’s reasonable to assume a fair amount of attrition when they ‘bring in their people’. Instead of hiring twice, hire the leader first to build out the team once. Management can come from within the company or outside. Many companies aim for a blend, half an internal and half external, to keep the culture strong, ensure continuity and alloy them with external perspectives and networks. For companies entering hyper growth, building a management layer is an important step to scaling effectively. As you build your financial plan, be sure to consider the number of managers you’ll need to hire and the timing. They are critical parts of the infrastructure of the team.

How much can a customer success manager manage? I’d heard the wisdom of $1-2M in ARR per year and around 80 accounts. But I hadn’t come across any data. Last summer, Gainsight posted the results of their survey on the topic. The truth is most CSMs manage between $2-5M in ARR and somewhere between 10-500 accounts. But it varies by segment. The charts above display Gainsight’s data . I’ve reformatted them to compare segments side-by-side. In the Enterprise and MidMarket, the survey indicates most CSMs manage $2-5M in ARR. We see a normal distribution with a slight left skew. This means it’s rarer to see a CSM manage 10-20M in ARR than $0.5M-$1M in ARR in both cases. In the enterprise, CSMs may be dedicated to a handful of large accounts boosting ARR per CSM. In the mid-market, where each account is worth in the mid-tens-of-thousands, 75% fewer CSMs manage $5-10M in ARR than in the enterprise. There is an upper limit to the number of relationships a CSM can manage. We’ll look at that data in a second. In the SMB the distribution is more uniform. Price points in the SMB can vary widely, as can the success effort. In some cases, much of the CSM work might be automated because the work is lighter touch enabling greater efficiency per CSM and consequently higher managed ARR. If we look at counts of accounts managed, the data is as you would expect. The lower the price point, the greater the number of accounts managed to reach that $2-5M in ARR managed per CSM. If we take the midpoint of the most popular ranges in the enterprise to estimate enterprise ACV, we get $3.5M in ARR/25 accounts for $140k ACV. The mid-market has a bimodal distribution: a spike at 50-100 accounts and another spike at 250-500 accounts. Doing the same midpoint math, the data suggests there are two types of MM companies: those in the 10k range and others in the 50k range. They are roughly equal in sample size for this survey. The ARR per CSM figures in this survey were higher than I had expected. This is a pleasant surprise for startups because it means the CSM investment per dollar of ARR goes further. The next analysis I’d like to see is the correlation of ARR/CSM to logo retention and customer expansion to answer the question: does a lower ratio of ARR/CSM translate into better expansion and retention?

Last year, I talked wrote 1% of Salesforce’s Revenue Makes a Unicorn. The post talked about the potential in the SaaS ecosystem for startups to identify underserved customers in existing installed bases of incumbents and build big companies serving them better. Kustomer is a customer support software business based in New York that is doing just that. And today they’re announcing two milestones for the business: their $35M Series C and 5x annual growth. Since we partnered with Kustomer six months ago, more and more companies have become our customers and benefitted from the software Brad and Jeremy have built. They include Ring, Rent the Runway, Glossier, Away Travel, UNTUCKit and Sweetgreen. There’s a category of businesses who deeply value the relationship with their customer. They don’t call their customer support agents by that name, but by other words: ambassador, relationship manager, guide, friend, and many other words that better capture the idea that commerce happens between two people. Not one person and a company. It’s those companies that we strive to serve at Kustomer. By unifying all the information about a customer in one place and providing a platform to act faster, with more knowledge, Kustomer empowers those businesses to fulfill their brand promises. That segment of companies who value support and customer engagement are underserved by existing platforms and they constitute a very large and growing segment. Beyond the round and the milestone, I’m excited to be working with Neeraj Agrawal at Battery, one of the top investors in software companies. Kustomer’s milestone is a step forward for the company and for a broader movement of startups satisfying the needs of underserved customer segments.

In the car yesterday, I listened to an interview with Eugene Wei, who described the dynamics of consumer technology as if they were plain as day. It’s rare to hear someone lucidly describe complex topics like the reasons for Twitter’s success and struggles. Eugene wrote many of his ideas in this post though there are some ideas that I found only in the podcast. Eugene was an early PM at Amazon, SVP of Product and Marketing at Hulu, Head of Product at Flipboard, and Head of Video at Oculus. He’s deep in consumer technologies. Here are some of the ideas that I found compelling: Humans like to peacock their status. Scarce things convey status but, the digital world makes fewer things scarce. Today, you can access any video, any song, any book through the Internet. We look  for scarce things in the physical world like eating at a Michelin three star restaurant. We pursue them in the digital world, too. Disappearing stories or CryptoKitties (there’s only one). Many new consumer products leverage this notion of status. The white headphones of the iPod, for example. Proof of work * in social networks is the key to growth in the early days. Facebook’s proof of work was a harvard.edu email address. Those are scarce and hard to obtain. 18 years of effort.  As Facebook grow, the requirement to prove work/scarcity diminished in favor of increasing the size of the user base. First to the rest of the Ivies. Then more colleges by rank. Then everyone. Many social networks follow this pattern. But reducing the proof of work requirement cools the social network. Status is less meaningful because it’s easier to obtain. So networks shift their value proposition from status displays to utility. WeChat started as a social network. Today, it’s deeply entrenched in the Chinese daily life as a payment mechanism that it’s still essential despite the fact that everyone’s grandmother and three year old niece has an account. Books sequester most of human knowledge in text, which though important, is the least accessible medium. The average American watches more than five hours of video per day, but reads 17 minutes. There is a big opportunity to transfer the deep reservoir of knowledge encoded in text to more accessible forms of media. Passive forms of media are powerful. This is the reason the audiobooks have taken off. Unlike reading, audiobooks continue even if I’m bored listening to it. If I’m reading a book and a board, I put down, unlikely to pick up. But if I’m in the car, I can tune out and tune in, and continue to learn passively. Invisible asymptotes. Every business and every person follows the S curve:  a period of slow discovery, rapid growth and then plateau. The upper shoulder of the S-curve, the plateau, is an invisible asymptote. It is very difficult to anticipate, but it is the key to continued growth for both people and businesses. In the blog post, Eugene describes Bezos’ anticipation of Amazon’s invisible asymptote. It’s worth reading. Eugene introduced several mental models of how the tech ecosystem works. They are worth thinking through. * Proof of work is a concept borrowed from cryptocurrencies. The idea is to develop status, someone has to exhibit a fair amount of effort.

I’m thrilled to welcome Travis Bryant as an entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) to Redpoint. I first heard Travis speak at a technology conference a few years ago. I noticed then that his thinking on go-to-market strategy is among the most modern in Startupland because it combines all of the key aspects of SaaS go-to-market in novel ways. Travis started his career in technology as an Oracle database administrator but moved into sales. He became VP of Commercial Sales at Salesforce, then SVP Sales at Optimizely and helped them grow from single digits to tens of millions of ARR. Travis is an expert in SaaS go-to-market and brings some insightful points of view. If you bump into him, ask him why, though he’s a proponent of aligning lead generation, sales and customer success under one leader, he’s not a fan of the Chief Revenue Officer title. We’ll be hosting a SaaS Office Hours with Travis at the Redpoint offices soon.

In 2015, I wrote about the trade-off facing vertical SaaS companies . Vertical SaaS companies focus their efforts on a particular group of customers. Procore targets construction with their software and Veeva targets pharmaceuticals with their CRM. This concentration limits the market size, but improves product market fit. Both of those businesses are now worth more than $3B. There is a new twist in SaaS with a parallel dynamic. I’ve started to call them AI Agencies. AI Agencies use machine learning to disrupt a market dominated by agencies. Often, these startups begin as software companies selling machine learning software into agencies. Finding scant market demand from the incumbents whose owners prefer status quo, these startups start their own agency. If you can’t sell to ’em, beat ’em. But they are not the typical agency. The startup leverages machine learning under the hood. AI agencies exist in recruiting, translation and online advertising. I expect this trend to continue across all major agency segments. Agencies scale revenue linearly with people. To grow revenue, an agency must hire more people. Most technology companies scale revenue independently of people. Consequently, agencies generate lower gross margins than software companies. The costs of goods sold - the salaries of employees - is higher than a server’s electricity bill. The AI Agency aims to leverage technology to break free from the linear relationship between revenue and people. Starting an AI Agency has two important benefits for machine learning companies. First, they create a data advantage. As they operate, AI agencies create high quality data for training machine learning models. In its early days, an AI agency operates identically to its less sophisticated cousin. But as it scales and as it grows, the AI agency replaces human hands with software. They accelerate workflows, and eventually automates some fraction of them. Second, they grow their market size. A software vendor in many of these categories might be able to address 5-10% of the total spend. Agencies address 95-100%. By repositioning as an agency, the start up increases market size by 10x-20x. The AI agency strives to have the best of both worlds. Larger market size and competitive gross margins through the use of technology. They will be an important movement in software over the next decade. Photo by Nick Hillier on Unsplash

In their book, It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work , Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, the founders of 37Signals share how they’ve built and run their very successful company Basecamp . There’s a novel idea in the book: your company is a product used by its employees. [W]hen you think of the company as a product, you ask different questions: Do people who work here know how to use the company? Is it simple? Complex? Is it obvious how it works? What’s fast about it? What’s slow about it? Are there bugs? What’s broken that we can fix quickly and what’s going to take a long time? In the book, Jason and David discuss the different iterations for project-work. First, they tackle projects for as long as they take - months. Then they found projects for three months maximum, before settling upon six-week project cycles. This turns out to be the optimal cadence for Basecamp. This philosophy extends to other areas of the company like vacations which are fully paid for by the company; favoring asynchronous communication;  kneecapping salary negotiations: no haggling allowed. Not least, the company champions a family first credo. The best companies aren’t families. They’re supporters of families. Allies of families. They’re there to provide healthy, fulfilling work environments so that when workers shut their laptops at a reasonable hour, they’re the best husbands, wives, parents, siblings, and children they can be. Their view: a company is a product used by its employees. In this light culture isn’t a static thing. The authors advocate pushing culture forward deliberately, actively managing it to harmonize it with the values of the business. As I read through the book, I wondered: who is the product manager for an organization? Who is evaluating the usability of the company, testing different ways business works better, and converging the ideals of the business into the day-to-day? For 37Signals, the founders are. But does this role exist in other companies outside the C-suite? I’m not sure. Maybe it should. This is a very different business book. There’s a section entitled Curb Your Ambition with chapters entitled Bury the Hustle; Our Goal: No Goals; and Don’t Change the World. Many in Silicon Valley embrace an opposite value system: maximizing ambition, demarcating a path to success through goals and, damn the torpedoes, let’s change the world. The authors challenge those notions directly. It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work advocates articulates a different way of building a company, with a different philosophy. Even if your ambitions differ it’s worth a read because there are some thought provoking ideas about how to run a very successful company.

In the public stock market, share repurchases/buybacks have reached more than $1 trillion in 2018 , a historic high. As the amount of private capital increases, share repurchases in startups are popping up. Typically, they are a very inefficient use of capital. A share repurchase occurs when the company uses cash on its balance sheet to buy shares from an existing shareholder, typically an employee or an early investor. For public companies, buying shares is a way of using excess capital to increase the earnings per share (EPS) and other metrics that investors care about. For startups, EPS isn’t a concern and cash is very expensive. Every dollar on the balance sheet dilutes shareholders, assuming the business is venture funded and unprofitable. If the business is a fast growing SaaS company, then each dollar invested to grow revenue increases the revenue of the company substantially. But a dollar invested to buy back a share increases the value of a business by a scintilla. Here’s how the math works. Assume a company sits at a $30M post money. Assume the company would like to repurchase 1% of common equity for about $300k. The number of outstanding shares has been reduced by 1%, so the price per share increases by 1.01%. Let’s compare to investing in the business. Assume the company used the $300k to hire two account executives at $150k OTE (on-target earnings) each with a $600k quota. Assume 60% quota attainment. In 12 months, these AEs have produced $720k in combined new ARR bolstering the valuation of the company by $7.2M. That’s a 250x better ROI that the share repurchase - quite a difference. There are reasons to pursue share repurchases. But when evaluating them, consider the significant opportunity cost of investing those dollars into the business, especially in the early stages of a company. NB: These types of buybacks differ from a share repurchase as part of a secondary transaction. With many large later stage rounds, new investors would like to own as much of the company as possible and accomplish this goal by buying shares from early employees because the company doesn’t want to bear more dilution than necessary. Because new investors ask for preferred shares and employees typically hold common, often these secondaries are structured as share repurchases. The investor gives money to the company, the company buys the shares from the common holders, retires the common shares, and creates new preferred shares in the same amount. There are downsides to this type of transaction as well, including increasing the depth preference stack (total value of preferred shares), without increasing the balance sheet of the company.

How far along was the typical SaaS Series A in 2018? The median business was at $1.8M in ARR and growing at 250%. The chart below shows a representative sample of SaaS Series As’ ARR and projected ARR growth rate for 2018. Breaking this down a bit more into quartiles, the ARR quartiles were: 25th 50th 75th 1.4 1.8 3.0 And the ARR growth rate quartiles were: 25th 50th 75th 140% 230% 320% These figures are larger than I expected. To be fair, 22% of companies raised at $0 in ARR. But the average MRR has increased substantially from [the last time I analyzed the data](last time I analyzed the data). (note I’m switching from median to average here). 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 50 112 163 n/a 203 In 4 years, we’ve seen a 4x increase in the median MRR of a Series A SaaS company.  That’s quite a growth rate. I didn’t calculate this figure in 2017. There are two reasons for this increase. First, the science of building SaaS companies is better understood today than in 2014. Consequently, more companies are able to reach $1M in ARR than in the past because they can be more efficient with their capital. Second, round sizes at the seed and the A have increased. More money enables startups to achieve greater milestones before raising the next round. Both of these factor work to increase the ARR at Series A. As for the growth rates, the 230% projected growth rate is close to the triple, triple, double, double, double growth strategy that has permeated SaaS. There are a handful of businesses who project greater than 300%, which is a bold assertion at such an early stage, but possible. The usual caveats to this data analysis apply. The sample size is on the smaller side; there are companies who raise Series Bs at less ARR than the median A for other factors; this analysis ignores space, competitive dynamics, team composition and auction pressure of financings.

Reading the news in the past week made me wonder. Just where are we pricing SaaS companies today? The Nasdaq and the S&P have toyed with a bear market. Many stocks are down 10 to 50%. Absolute valuations are one consideration, but let’s understand it at a deeper level. Have multiples compressed? The answer is yes, they have, but enterprise value to forward revenue multiples are still at some of the highest levels for SaaS companies in the  past eight years. In February 2014, forward multiples touched 7.7x. Then prices began a long descent into the February nadir at 3.3x forward. The market pushed higher for nearly 36 months to a new high in September 2018 at 9.5x forward. Yes, we have fallen 25% from highs. And that’s quite a correction. But we’re not close to the 8 year median of 5.2x. The most highly sought after businesses like Atlassian, Okta and Alteryx trade at 11x+ and top out at 15x. These are exceptional businesses growing at exceptional rates trading at exceptional prices. And despite the overall change in multiples, more SaaS companies have benefitted from multiple expansion over the last 12 months than those whose multiples have compressed. What does this mean for early stage startups? If prices hold at these levels, even with the recent correction, I don’t think there’s much impact to the private markets. With approximately $100B raised in the last 12 months by venture and growth funds, all with an approximately 3 year investment period, the supply of venture dollars should still be strong. Rising interest rates suggest venture debt, which has been sold very inexpensively since quantitative easing decreased interest rates, may increase in price. The exit markets may see some changes. Multiples at IPO will be lower in 2019 than for most of 2018. But 2018’s multiples were at decade highs, and 2019s figures are are 40%+ larger than the trailing 8 year median. M&A may also slow as acquirers’ multiples have compressed as well: Google touched a 52 week low this week. SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and others have all suffered contractions of 20-40%. The public market perturbation may decrease the big fishes’ appetites. Perhaps the biggest changes may be in customer budgets. From the WSJ , “Sentiment among chief financial officers, who help set budgets that will shape investment and hiring decisions, has also soured. Half of CFOs believe a recession will start within a year, and 80% think a recession will hit by the end of 2020, according to a Duke University survey.” There’s volatility in the public markets, but SaaS companies are still some of the most expensive equities around, which is great news for startups. The biggest question is how buyers and their budgets evolve in this period of volatility.

Here are some predictions for 2019 and a review of my thoughts for 2018, many of which were wrong. The M&A market slows meaningfully , especially at the multi-billion dollar level. The recent seasickness in the public markets forces most CEOs adopt a more conservative approach to acquisitions. Facing large swings in valuation, these leaders may struggle to advocate and articulate that large acquisitions are accretive and will be immediately rewarded by share appreciation after an acquisition. The IPO market remains open despite the turbulence of the public markets because institutional investors still seek better than market returns. Multiples of SaaS companies have remained at relative highs: still trading at 8x forward as of today, which is 45% above historical averages. Blockchain technology finds its second killer application. After all the hype and ICO-mania in 2017, the flurry of startups attempting to solve every startup with a distributed ledger and the collapse of currencies in 2018, one startup emerges in 2019 with the next killer use case; Bitcoin being the first.  I suspect the second killer application will not be currency based, but a consumer product. The Monoclouds continue to challenge the open source ecosystem by offering hosted services of popular projects. This will force startups to move up-the-stack into the platform and application tiers. Startups begin to siphon off important but underserved segments of SaaS incumbent’s customer bases. 1% of Salesforce’s revenue makes a unicorn . This will occur in all major SaaS categories, products serving VPs of Marketing, Sales, Engineering, and Customer Support. Data engineering is the new Customer Success. A decade ago Customer Success wasn’t on anyone’s lips. There were no VPs of CS in most software businesses. Data engineering, the discipline of moving data well, will have a breakout moment, complete with conferences, thought leaders and a company that becomes the symbol of the category. [ 2018 Predictions ](Photo by Ramón Salinero on Unsplash) The tax holiday for repatriation creates one of the most active M&A environments of the past ten years. This was true . Software M&A volume neared $100B, almost 3x better than any year in the past seven. There were many take-privates, acquisitions the day before the IPO (2 of those), and classic M&A. The most notable thing may have been the multiples which were 2x higher than in recent years. The SaaS fundraising market remains ebullient through 2018 as vibrant M&A and an open IPO window trigger substantial liquidity for shareholders . Right. SaaS fundraising remained strong. Volumes relative to 2017 didn’t change materially, though. Machine learning fades as a buzzword. To an extent. There are still many pitches with ML, but chatbots have faded and so has the idea of applying ML to everything with the thesis that it will differentiate the product in market. __Blockchain in the enterprise takes the reign as the buzzword for 2018.*__ Wrong. In retrospect, Kubernetes is the technology for 2018 that broke out, both in adoption and VMWare’s acquisition of Heptio. The classic open source strategy of the last fifteen years is abandoned because of the competitive threats from infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS vendors). Correct. Amazon launched competitors to many startups at its annual Reinvent conference, especially at the database tier. GDPR becomes an important consideration in most SaaS companies. Wrong . Regulations like GDPR remain important, but after the initial panic and slower sales cycles, it seems to me that these regulations have become no different than SOC2 and ISO compliances. A cost of doing business. Businesses emerge that create opinionated stacks for different functional roles and simplify day-to-day tasks for knowledge workers. Wrong. We didn’t see this in 2018 at all! Looking forward to a great 2019. Happy holidays to everyone. Photo by Ramón Salinero on Unsplash

The five most popular posts of 2018 were: The Strategic Shift in Revenue for SaaS Startups as They Scale -  or popular by any other post by a factor of 10, this post discusses the importance of focusing on renewals as a business reaches $10M, $20M and beyond in ARR. The dynamics of retention meaningfully change the way the business ought to be managed. Ten Year’s Worth of Learnings About Pricing - This post is a summary of a presentation I gave to the executive team at Twilio. The presentation and the post summarize everything I know about pricing, which remains today one of the most befuddling questions for founders, and one of the most frequent questions I’m asked. Dropbox S-1 - There were many questions surrounding the Dropbox IPO. The most memorable one was how does the business compare to Box.  of course, we know now that they serve different markets. Box It is almost entirely enterprise while Dropbox serves predominantly the consumer market. Dropbox’s efficient customer acquisition is exceptional. Red Hat’s Acquisition - A Triumph of Open Source - We saw many massive acquisitions this year. The RedHat acquisition demarcates a new high water mark for open source. Acquisition is particularly important this year, a year in which many investors have questioned the viability of open-source businesses in the next few years. Competition from Amazon and other cloud providers who host successful open source products has become an increasingly stiff headwind. The Clearest Articulation of a Marketing Roadmap -  After I interviewed a VP Marketing candidate, I summarized her perspective on marketing with this post. I still think it captures the key responsibility a marketer possesses: guiding a market and the buyer through a journey. In retrospect, I think there’s one key component missing which is a discussion around product marketing, and I hope to remedy that with a post soon. They span quite a few different topics including marketing, M&A, and financial planning.

These are my ten favorite books from 2018. The (Mis)Behavior of Markets - Written by Benoit Mandelbrot, the Belgian mathematician who pioneered fractals, this book and theory inspired Naseem Taleb. It’s a powerful book on the uncertain nature of financial turbulence. Creative Selection - Ken Kocienda, a former Apple engineer who co-authored Safari and the iPhone keyboard, writes about culture at Apple. Among other insights , he discusses the most effective ways to brainstorm with teams - it’s not with ideas. American Pastoral - Philip Roth is the most decorated novelist in American history. I read his speech “ I Have Fallen in Love with American Names ” in the New Yorker and I won’t ever forget the way it evoked in me a sense of pride in American unity. When a founder told me about this book, I read it right away. He is right. American Pastoral is one of Roth’s finest books, and a Pulitzer winner. The Zurich Axioms - Max Gunther, former journalist and Princeton graduate in the 1950s, interviews many of the most successful Swiss bankers and condenses his learnings into a book. There are some provocative points of view including: investing is the same as gambling, we just call it another name. American Kingpin - the true story of an Eagle Scout became one of the US largest drug runners in about five years; and how three government agencies captured him in a public library in San Francisco. The Importance of Being Earnest - a classic play by Oscar Wilde. Most humor doesn’t endure, but this satire does. This short book is laugh out loud funny. Finite and Infinite Games - This book forces you to think about the world differently. Every time you engage with someone else, you’re either playing a finite game or an infinite game. And how you ought to engage in each is radically different. The Courage to be Disliked - Alder was a master philosopher, a contemporary of Freud and Jung, but less well known. In this book, the author explains Alderian psychology via conversations between a sage and a student. Why We Sleep - Read this book to understand why sleeping is the most important thing you should do today . More than working out. More than meditating. It’s the best investment of your time. Bad Blood - It will make your blood boil. It’s the story of Theranos, the failed medical startup.

Over the last month, I’ve been modernizing this site with one goal in mind: speed. The net result from that effort is a 90% reduction in page load time from 5 seconds to about 500 milliseconds. At Google, I learned page load time is highly correlated to engagement metrics including bounce rate and time on site. I’ve been focused on it ever since. This is how I did it. Hugo :  I moved to a static site generator in 2014 . Static site generators create webpages that load immediately. There are no database calls. Just fast load times. Initially, I used Jekyll, but now I’m Hugo, which runs faster because it’s written in go instead of ruby. Render : Render is a new cloud provider. I moved because of the seamless deployment, free https certificates, and a lightning fast network. Also, I compress JS and CSS during the build process through their platform. Plus, they have terrific customer support.  Before, I ran Route53, CloudFront and S3 static site hosting which is far more complicated. Cloudinary : Cloudinary is an image serving service that optimizes the image size, quality and format for the device and network connection. Since images are the largest assets, this change made a big difference. In addition to these core infrastructure changes, I use two other components. Algolia : Algolia powers the search. This is a long time coming after many requests. I use Render to create the search index and send it to Algolia after every new post. Forestry : Forestry is a beautiful web client for static sites that makes it easy to write new posts. It integrates into Cloudinary for easy image insertion. All these together should make it much easier to browse this blog and search previous posts. Photo by PAUL SMITH on Unsplash

If you have one marketing dollar to spend on your startup’s growth, should you spend it on acquiring a new customer or on expanding an existing customer? Mining the existing customer base for customer expansion seems very logical. Customers know your product and your sales team, so increasing the account value should be easier. Plus, the strategy is successful in practice. The PacCrest survey suggests upsell drives somewhere between 8-26% of new bookings for SaaS companies, depending on the scale of the business. The larger the business, the greater the fraction of new bookings from upsell. But at the early stages, investors value new logo acquisition more than customer expansions by investors. Why? There are three reasons. First, acquiring new customers is one of the hardest things to do efficiently in SaaS. And it’s getting harder. Scalable new customer acquisition suggests the business will continue to grow at attractive rates. New customer acquisition requires product market fit, a well run go-to-market function and differentiation. Second, a customer base has a maximum potential. If a business has 100 customers, and each customer at most can pay $100k, the total addressable revenue is $10M. Growth is capped. Even if all that $10M can be efficiently acquired, without new customers, the company’s value won’t appreciate materially. Third, in the end, distribution is the only long-term moat . A company that can’t achieve broad distribution to cross-sell products isn’t defensible. The competitor that figures out distribution will ultimately win the biggest chunk of the market . Account growth is also important, of course. Best in class companies typically achieve 120% negative net expansion. But in the early days, maximizing account value shouldn’t be the focus. Though it’s the harder path, spending that marketing dollar on new customer acquisition is the better way to build value for venture-backed startups. Photo by Daniel Lincoln on Unsplash

I’ve wondered what it’s like to work at Apple. I’ve read books and articles about Steve Jobs and the turbulence the company experienced. Ken Kocienda co-wrote the Safari browser and developed the first iPhone keyboard.  His book, Creative Selection, is the first book that provides a view of the day to day environment at Apple. It’s full of wisdom. These are my learnings from the book. There are few brainstorming sessions at Apple because ideas are difficult to debate. Debating something physical is much easier. When faced with a challenge, each person on a team creates their own solution to a problem and then presents that solution. The best ideas surface and improve through direct feedback and iteration. Ken calls this concept Creative Selection. A product’s definition of greatness . “Steve thought speed was the long term key to better browsing, so making a high performance browser became our top priority, our definition for greatness.” One of the release criteria for each build became a test called the Page Load Test. The PLT measured Safari’s time in loading pages from across the internet. Each time an engineer committed code, the team would accept it only if was PLT neutral or better. Each product should have a simple definition of greatness. For example, the best email client reduces the amount of time spent processing the same amount of mail. Market features customers value. When Ken is assigned to the iSync team, he asks a friend in marketing to help him develop a marketing strategy. His friend replies, “Ken, we don’t market sync. We don’t really consider it … well … a customer facing technology.” Which technologies do you market today that your customers don’t value? This goes back to starting with the why, why the technology matters Execute a single play very well, all the way to the Super Bowl. Great execution of simple things can win a market because great execution is a real challenge. Vince Lombardi took the Packers from last place in the NFL to the Superbowl in one season by focusing the team on a single play, the PowerSweep. The team executed that play over and over again. Though the competition knew it was coming, they couldn’t defend it well, so great was the execution. I think this idea is becoming more applicable in software/SaaS where technology differentiation is less pronounced and execution is a stronger differentiator. Creative Selection is a great read, and provided me a new lens into the world of the single greatest consumer electronics company of our generation. There are insights here which can apply to many different industries.

Customers will pay you to build your SaaS product. It’s one of the great advantages of a SaaS model. Annual prepay contracts - wherein customers pay for a year’s cost on day - is a free loan from customers. And every startup can benefit from this advance. There’s only one requirement: you must be able to sell your product while you’re building it. Step 1 is reaching product market fit, the point at which some group of potential customers will pay. This minimum viable product is likely very thin. Despite its thinness, there is an initial customer segment willing to pay for it. Then the startup develops a go-to-market to identify others who belong to that segment, and sells the basic product to them. The company collects revenue, hires more engineers and develops the second version of the product. Phase 2 may take many forms. It may be to increase the product’s price and sell it to the same customers (feature expansion). It may be to sell to a different customer segment (move up-market or pursue a new vertical). Or it may be to sell the product in a different way (self-sign up vs inside sales). Phase 3 to Phase n, however long into the future, repeats this idea. This strategy requires the product roadmap be architected to put new features and products into market early and often. Building a product for a long time without customers starves the business of revenue. This revenue  is non-dilutive capital. With enough money coming in, the business requires less external capital to grow and improve the product. But this is easier said than done. The company must maintain the product in a salable state. Product and engineering teams must work in synchrony, and the company must possess a good understanding of the market requirements early on. There are exceptions to this idea. First, if you can raise huge sums of capital and you know the market cold. Second, the market requires a fully developed product before acceptance. Snowflake is a company that we work with at Redpoint that meets both these criteria. They developed their software for years before releasing it. Setting aside these exceptions, many startups can benefit from releasing a product into market that generates cash to finance the development of a better product. It may take extra product effort, but the increase in capital efficiency pays for the investment many times over.

There many ways of measuring a SaaS company’s efficiency: magic number, payback period on cost of customer acquisition, lifetime value to cost customer acquisition ratio, quick ratio. These metrics primarily focus on measuring efficiency in customer acquisition. But, a software company’s true efficiency also have to include the cost to service contracts. A SaaS company’s revenues are a collection of annuities, contracts that pay fees on an ongoing basis. And the goal of a subscription businesses is more than to acquire those streams, but to nurture and sustain them. One way of measuring this is by calculating the company’s cost per recurring gross profit dollar (CRGPD). In other words, how much must a business spend in order to generate one recurring gross profit dollar over the course of a year? ‘Cost_per_Recurring_Gross_Profit_Dollar = (Cost_of_Acquisition /Annual_Revenue_Retention + Cost_to_Serve) / Gross_Profit’ If a company suffers a high churn rate, the business must acquire an initial customer and then pay again to acquire another customer later that year to replace the gross profit contribution of the churned customer. To figure out total CAC over the year, we divide the CAC by the annual revenue retention of the business. Plus, we have to add in the Cost to Serve, which are the cost of customer success. And last we divide by the gross profit dollars generated. Unlike CAC Payback Period or LTV/CAC which are unit metrics that measure efficiency on a per customer basis, CRGM measures efficiency on a per dollar basis. Why does this matter? It’s akin to the difference between churn on a customer basis and churn on a dollar basis. Both are important, but measure different things. Imagine a business that has a CAC of $1000, an ACV $2500, a gross margin of 80%, customer success cost of $500 and a churn rate of 10% per month. The payback period is 5 months, sales efficiency is 2, which are great, but the LTV/CAC is 1.2 but the churn is off the charts. ‘CRGPD = (1000/.28	 + 500)/2000 = 2.0’ In other words, to sustain a recurring gross profit dollar, this business must invest $2 each year. Imagine the same company with 0.5% monthly churn, and the CRGPD falls to $0.8. This more efficient business can invest about 40% of the dollars to maintain that annuity stream. The CRGPD measures the company’s efficiency in acquiring and sustaining a gross profit annuity stream. The smaller the figure, the more efficient the business.

Your startup is just getting off the ground. You might have a few account executives and a sales leader in place; maybe some revenue and a handful of customers. The sales team costs real money, and the question before the company is: how do you know what quota plan to assign to the account executives? I’ve seen four stages in early stage software companies. Some businesses employ all four, others just use one or two. Knowing about the options ahead of time may help you figure out the right sales plan for your startup. Stage 1: Management by Objectives In the very earliest stages, the company doesn’t know how to sell or how to price. The most important goal isn’t price maximization, but just closing some business. Many teams in this stage guarantee a draw/salary for the account executives, instead of assigning a commission, while the company figures out the sales process. The salary is influenced by traditional goals or OKRs. The key idea: MBOs enable AEs to experiment with new processes to find the right one. Stage 2: Logo Based Quota Bill Binch, former SVP at Marketo, employed this strategy in the early days . Quotas weren’t denominated in dollars; they were just a number. “Can you close six accounts this year worth more than $30k per year?” That’s a logo based quota. Logo based quotas empower AEs with more flexibility to find customers in new ways, build the important base of logos for marketing and fundraising, and enable AEs to develop confidence in their approaches. Stage 3: Short Term Quota As the business transitions from Stage 1 or Stage 2, quite a bit is changing. Marketing is generating pipeline, which is likely coming in fits and starts. The company is hiring more account executives and determining how to forecast ramp time, ratios of SDR/AE and Sales Engineer/AE. During these periods of flux, the company can roll out a short term quota, a six month quota, and reserve the right to modify quota up or down depending on performance. By communicating this clearly at sales kickoff or during interviews, you can set expectations properly with the team. Stage 4: Long Term Quota Long term quotas are annual quotas. At this point, the company has a predictable model in place which includes most of the key variables: ramp time, sales cycles, price points, consistent pipeline generation. And the company is confident in its ability to set up new and existing account executives to succeed. Long term quotas also might involve SPIFs (sales performance incentive funds) that incentivize different behaviors like upsells rather than new sales, or B2C customers vs B2B, or accelerators based on consistent quarterly performance that smooths bookings throughout the year. The ultimate goal of any compensation plan is to ensure account executive success at each stage. Managing these plans properly will enable the company to recruit new AEs to scale, because the current ones excel. In addition, as the business grows, changing the commission plans enables the business to balance AE success and commissions with burn rate and runway.

Another week, another blockbuster software acquisition! This time SAP has agreed to purchase Qualtrics for $8B. Qualtrics is a Utah based provider of experience management software. Qualtrics writes and sells software to ask questions of employees and customers to help businesses improve customer experience, employee satisfaction products, and brand. Qualtrics had intended to go public this week. The company generated $342M in the last twelve months and had grown 27% annually. Qualtrics fetched 23x trailing twelve months revenue multiple. This is the second largest among those I have tracked. The only one greater is the Microsoft/Github acquisition, which is based on press reports of Github’s revenue. Each of the other data points is substantiated through public investor disclosures. It’s the largest ever VC backed software acquisition. Congratulations to the Qualtrics team! Let’s put the 2018 acquisition environment into context. It’s the best M&A market in the last seven years for $1B+ sales with six. 2012 witnessed 3 acquisitions. In addition, 2018 acquisition values for this type of acquisition exceed $60B, more than twice 2016, which included the Microsoft/LinkedIn merger. Prices in 2018 are also the highest across this time frame. Before 2018, only two acquisitions were consummated at EV/TTM revenue multiples greater than 10. In 2018, six of seven acquisitions have gone off at 10x+ and three at 20x+. It’s astounding. Last November, a year ago, I estimated the latent purchasing power of the software ecosystem to be about $30B , excluding debt. I was off by a factor of 2. The shift to the cloud has happened at a greater scale than most legacy software businesses estimated. And they are spending to catch up.  Amongst acquirers IBM, Microsoft and SAP have spent the most: $25B+ each. IBM acquired one company, RedHat. Microsoft bought LinkedIn and Github. SAP bought 5 companies: Ariba, Callidus, Concur, Qualtrics, Successfactors. We’re bound to see more.

Over the weekend, IBM announced the largest software acquisition of Red Hat, an open-source software company, for $35B. It is the largest software acquisition in history, and the third largest technology acquisition (Dell/EMC at $67B and JDS/SDL for $41B were both larger hardware mergers). IBM will spend 31% of their current market cap for Red Hat and pay a 70% premium to Red Hat’s closing price on Friday. It’s a triumph of the open source strategy. Three of the largest software acquisitions of the last ten years have been open source. They have all occured in 2018, a year in which more than $60B of $1B+ software M&A has transpired. This price values the company at a 10.6x enterprise value/trailing twelve month revenue multiple. Relative to other multiples paid this year, this acquisition price isn’t an extreme. But the aggregate price certainly is. Red Hat employs nearly 12,000 people across 90 offices. The company generates $3.2B in annual revenue growing at 19% annually at 85% gross margin. Only 12% of revenue is professional services. Red Hat offers three groups of software products: Operating System (Linux and virtualization); Application Development (application server/JBoss); New Infrastructure (OpenShift, OpenStack and Ansible). Revenue contribution across these categories is 64%, 23% and 13%. The core infrastructure (operating system and app development) are certainly great businesses, growing between 10-25% annually. The New Infrastructure is the fastest growing, doubling year over year. I regard Red Hat’s OpenShift platform as the leader in enterprise platform-as-a-service. OpenShift provides a modern development environment for software engineers. OpenShift simplifies the deployment and management of complex technologies like Kubernetes for large enterprises. IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat reshapes the software ecosystem overnight. It validates open-source in a powerful way. IBM makes a huge leap forward in the open source community. Red Hat contributes to tens if not hundreds of the most important open source projects. And it provides IBM with software and services to sell.

Earlier this year, I wrote about MadKudu’s analysis of free trials and asked if readers were interested in another benchmarking survey on the topic, and the response was overwhelming. Over the last few weeks, my colleague Patrick Chase , and I (along with help from many people in the community) have been busy putting the survey together. I’d like to thank Ryan Janssen for lending a hand. If you’d like to participate, please fill out the survey here . Surveys are due November 2. It takes about 6 minutes complete. All the data collected is anonymized. Those participating will receive access to the raw, anonymized data. In a few more weeks, we’ll publish our findings on this blog. We hope to illuminate trends in freemium/free-trial such as: the optimal length of a free trial; the increase in conversion rate of a trial lead touched by sales; the use of free trial across customer segments and ACVs; and the structure of a free trial (is it time bound, feature bound, usage bound etc?) In our portfolio, we’ve seen the use of free trial and online customer acquisition be a powerful tool for SaaS and infrastructure software companies alike. In addition, the use of these marketing tactics spans the contract value gamut. I’m curious to learn how broad these trends are. Please spread the word so we can get a representative data set. We look forward to sharing the research with the community.

I’ve written quite a bit about the public market software multiples. They’ve increased to near historic levels with forward revenue multiples approaching 9x. As the public markets have appreciated, something has happened that I didn’t expect. Some public companies are now fetching the mulitples of the most attractive private companies. I thought valuations between the markets would normalize because of a deflation in both public and private. Today, we have the beginnings of normalization by inflation. In the private markets, high growth software companies are often priced as a function of the ARR at the end of next year . In industry parlance, this is NTM ARR, or next twelve months annual recurring revenue. Sought-after later stage private companies raise capital somewhere between 10x-20x NTM ARR. That’s a broad range. Multiples vary with growth rate, capital efficiency, market size, demand, and other characteristics. It’s dynamic. In the private markets, multiples have been increasing during the last few quarters. Public market investors don’t use this metric today. Instead, they use NTM Revenue multiple, summing the revenue over the next twelve months or LTM (last 12 months) summing revenue over the last twelve months. But what if we examined public companies in this way? By annualizing the most recent quarter of subscription revenue (i.e., multiply by four) we get estimated ARR. Then we can project next year’s ARR by using the company’s projected growth rate. Amazingly, there are nine companies who are valued at greater than 10x NTM ARR. Atlassian, Veeva, Appian, ZScaler, Okta, Coupa, Xero, Alteryx, and ServiceNow. Atlassian and Veeva are valued at 16x NTM ARR. These multiples are similar to those in the private markets. In retrospect, the normalization does make sense. What is the difference between a late stage private company and a new public company? Aside from compliance efforts, not much. They should be priced similarly, provided the metrics are similar. And that’s exactly what’s happened. Why do I look at these multiples? I’m not a public markets investor. But these numbers impact the startup markets. Multiples influence acquisition prices and valuations in the private markets. When acquirers consider an acquisition, they evaluate a comparable company data set, also called a comp sheet. Inevitably, these sheets list enterprise value multiples. In addition, later stage investors model new investments based on public trading comparables. Does this mean that we’re close to the top? We’re at or very near 10 year highs on enterprise multiples for software companies. The bull case: enterprises are moving to the cloud and shifting $1.5T of spend. All these companies will benefit. The bear case: valuations for these businesses assume long term continued success. Shakiness in future prospects of these companies could result in a correction.

Last week, AirBnB proposed granting their most valuable hosts shares in the company , much like employees. This requires a change in securities law. It’s a novel idea that has a history, promise and some risks. In 1998, an online travel agency, TravelZoo, tried this . They granted free shares to 700,000 people who signed up to use the service. Administration of these shares proved a headache for the company. Many of those who received the shares were unaware of conversion deadlines. The company honored its commitments anyway. The company bore some additional regulatory burden. In 2004, six years later fewer than 1000 of these shareholders had traded their shares for cash. Not a ringing success. Twenty years later, the Internet is far broader and more robust. 15% fewer American households own stock . Startups remain private longer. The SEC is actively investigating ways to provide main street with access to startups. And the Blockchain is here. This is a wonderful confluence of factors that provide a fertile environment for a far more successful try this time. Network effect businesses, those like AirBnB and Facebook, face a theoretical risk from blockchain startups. Blockchain technology incentivizes network participants. I received a token for using a service. If more people use that service, my token is worth more. I should do everything I can to increase the value of that token. The user benefits as the network scales. This doesn’t happen today. AirBnB’s idea defends their business from threats from crypto-upstarts. They propose to replicate tokens’ value with shares. Shares have several benefits over tokens in this model. First, familiarity. Half of Americans already hold shares; they’ve paid taxes for shares; they have brokerage accounts to hold them. Hosts aren’t required to open new accounts or learn about tokens. Second, shares are simpler. They don’t require new protocols, or miners, or management of a token economy. Protocol design is a new discipline, something that AirBnB may not have. Third, AirBnB doesn’t have to change its business very much. AirBnB’s IPO preparation will serve hosts/employees as well as institutional and retail investors. Imagine trying to manage both public market investors and a token economy. If the SEC permits AirBnB and other network-effect companies to reward usage with shares, the SEC may dull the competitive threat from blockchain - especially where there’s an incumbent. And it could kick off a broader wave of share or option distribution to non-employees as an incentive.

In early markets, customers prefer entire solutions, not best in class point products. These solutions often include significant professional services and education. At the beginning of a new wave, most customers don’t understand the technology well. So, they seek experts to guide them. Companies that provide services and education often win the early market. They develop customer relationships, reinforce their expertise with a strong brand, define the purchasing criteria in their favor and ultimately grow faster. In the earliest days of commercial Hadoop, Cloudera educated the market through services. As they grew the user base, they developed subscription products, which now account for about 75% of revenue . In the IoT (internet of things), C3IoT and UpTake have pursued similar strategies. In the cloud native world, Heptio provides consulting and training for Kubernetes, a new infrastructure technology. In each case, the new technology is complex and understood by few. During this early phase in the market - Carlota Perez calls it the installation phase - professional services is important. Professional services educates new buyers and grows the market. As a market matures and enters the deployment phase, the buyer refines their purchasing decision. They replace pieces of the initial all-in-one stack with best-of-breed point solutions. A few years in, they understand their needs better. If your startup operates in a new market or champions a new fundamental technology, you have a strategic decision. Do you offer education and professional services at scale? If you don’t offer those services, you bet that the market will mature quickly enough by itself to create a large market opportunity for you. That enough buyers will self-educate or educate themselves through other means. And, those buyers eventually come to buy your solution at that point. You may have to wait for the market to mature and that timing is difficult to predict. This is a defensive stance. I believe it’s better to be aggressive: offer PS and education. Instead of waiting, your startup can attack the market opportunity. Selling PS means your startup will find, educate and inculcate new buyers in your philosophies and methodologies. Most of them will choose to buy your software since they’ve asked you to educate them. Revenues will surge, you’ll build a brand, and understand the market in greater depth. You’ll have many more customer interactions. You’ll also influence the speed at which the market matures. Naturally, there is a tradeoff. Most boards and management teams steer businesses away from professional services. Services revenues are less valuable, less sustainable and consequently less attractive to investors. As a rough rule of thumb, one dollar of software revenue is worth 8x a dollar of services revenue. But in the early phases of fundamental infrastructure and software shifts, services and education are a powerful tool to shift the competitive playing field in your direction.

Dr. Richard Cook, formerly an associate professor at the University of Chicago, published a paper in 1998 entitled How Complex Systems Fail . In his paper, Dr. Cook lists 18 observations from his research in medicine about failure of complex systems. His insights are directly applicable to running software at scale, and those observations informed our latest investment in Gremlin . Some of his Cook’s are obvious. Complex systems are intrinsically hazardous systems.  Complex systems are heavily and successfully defended against failure. Catastrophe requires multiple failures – single point failures are not enough. Others are surprising.  Catastrophe is always just around the corner. Humans are both the producer and the defenders against failure. All practitioner actions are gambles. Change introduces new forms of failure. All of this applies to software. Every company is becoming a software company. Every company relies on software to make money. If that software fails, companies lose money. Gremlin solves that problem. Gremlin instills resiliency through orchestrated chaos. Kolton and Matt, the founders of Gremlin, understand deeply the challenges of operating colossal webscale systems. They lived it at Amazon, Salesforce and Netflix.  To achieve ever greater uptime in those organizations, they leveraged chaos engineering. Chaos engineering is the discipline of introducing failure into a software system on purpose to identify why, how and when it might break in the future; and then fixing it. Chaos teams start small, with experiments challenging the resilience of a single server or virtual machine. As the team gains confidence in their infrastructure, these experiments grow in scope. Gremlin’s software provides the platform for planning and executing these experiments, understanding the impacts and identifying the right next steps to fix issues before they arise. Companies like Twilio, Expedia and Under Armour use their technology today to fight the failure Dr. Cook observed in complex systems. We’re thrilled to partner with Gremlin, and work with Kolton and Matt to scale their business and bring the discipline and benefits of chaos engineering to many more companies.

About two years ago, Marketo was publicly traded and valued at roughly $1.1B. Vista Equity paid $1.8B to take the company private, a 64% premium. At the time it was taken private by Vista, Marketo generated $241M in trailing revenue, growing at 35% annually. Its net income margin was -31%. Last week, Adobe announced they acquired Marketo for $4.75B. By the time of the sale, revenues had grown to $321M, growing at about 21% annually and profitable. Presumably, the company traded investments in growth for profitability to service the new debt. The Marketo story highlights three important trends in SaaS. First, PE can generate spectacular results in software. Vista generated a estimated return of about 3.1x on $1.4B in equity for an IRR of about 72% in 25 months. According to reports from Reuters , Marketo/Vista borrowed $400M, and used equity for the remaining $1.4B. I expect PE to remain a very active acquirer of venture backed SaaS . Second, the M&A environment continues to boil. Adobe paid 14.8x trailing twelve months, the third highest multiple for large software acquisitions. The other two, Mulesoft and Github, also transpired this year. Had Adobe won the bidding in 2016 for the company, they could have owned the same asset for $3B less. In fact, relative to acquisitions of software companies growing at similar rates, at $4.75B, Third, the multiple expansion in the SaaS market continues, and it’s incredible. In the public market, Marketo was valued at about 5x trailing revenues. When it was taken private, the multiple jumped to 7.5x. At the Adobe sale, the multiple doubled to 14.8x. There are two major drivers of the multiple expansion in the market. First, there is the broader bullish backdrop of the decade long stock market run. But second, the markets software companies address are far bigger than previously anticipated, than previously estimated. Marketo is the brand name in the marketing automation category. Its evolution over the last two years is a microcosm of the surrounding SaaS environment.

A founder asked me recently if there were any trends in professional services across public SaaS companies. I had examined the gross margins and share of revenue from professional services about 3 years ago. Professional services are consulting fees software companies charge to customers for software configuration, customization and education. What has changed over the past 3 years? First, we have more comprehensive data set, since many more companies have gone public. Second, many newer software companies generate substantial fractions of their revenue from PS. Appian is close to 50%; Pegasystems is at 37%; Horton is at 24%; Mulesoft at 20%. In the past, companies with higher professional services components to their revenue have been valued less highly because PS revenue isn’t recurring and is lower margin than software revenue. In addition, the gross margins from professional services look different than three years ago. The variance is much higher. One one hand, Domo earns 41% of gross margin on their service; while Castlight operates a -72% gross margin PS business. While the average may be zero, that figure doesn’t capture the reality. Across all these companies, PS sees a fair amount of variance year by year. It’s difficult to project how much services revenue a company will book in a year. Staffing can be tricky. Hire too many people and your margin declines. Hire too few and you may not be able to on-board all those customers your sales team wants to close. As more companies go public, we observe many more models for deploying software at different price points, sales motions and fulfillment motions. This professional services data underscores that point. There are companies making healthy margins on PS, while others basically give services away. There are companies who use PS to win business and those who prefer to minimize services by either outsourcing it, or focusing on customers who don’t require it.

Last week, Elastic filed their S-1 to go public . Elastic is a Dutch company founded in 2012. Just five years later, the company generated $159.9M in revenue. Elastic commercializes open source software called the Elastic Stack, a set of different products that enable users to search and store data in many different sources and formats. This software is used for  application search, website search, enterprise search, application performance monitoring, and analytics for business and security data. To put this company’s exceptional success in context, I plotted their metrics alongside Mulesoft, another enormously successful open source company that Salesforce acquired for $6.5B. In the charts that follow,  I have plotted Elastic’s metrics the two years before their IPO, marked as -2 and -1. I have plotted Mulesoft’s metrics from 2015 and 2016, which was -3 and -2 years before IPO, but the companies were at similar scales. There are many important difference between these two companies. The most salient: the average customer value. Mulesoft pursues much larger contracts. At IPO,  a new customer generated $143,000 in revenue. Elastic, on the other hand, focuses more on the midmarket. Their ACV is $32k. this implies different go to market motions, different fractions of revenue generated from on premises versus hosted deployments, and likely different composition of their sales teams. Now, onto the numbers: First, let’s examine revenue. Elastic grew from $88.2M to $159.9M, an 80% annual growth rate. Mulesoft grew from $110 million to $188 million, a 71% growth rate. To grow at these rates and at this scale is exceptional. Moving on to gross margin. Gross margin is equal to revenue minus the cost of goods sold which includes things like hosting costs and customer support. The median publicly traded software company is at 71%. Mulesoft is right on the button at 70.1%, while Elastic has been higher but is asymptoting to that figure. To grow these rates, both companies spend quite a bit in sales and marketing. The chart above shows the sales and marketing spend divided by revenue.  Mulesoft invested 85% and 65% of revenue, while Elastic spent 64 and 52% of revenue. This suggests that Elastic’s sales and marketing motion is more efficient than Mulesoft. They spend less as a percentage of revenue on sales and marketing, yet grow revenue nine percentage points faster. Net dollar expansion is a bit better for Elastic. Mulesoft reported a 1.25x net dollar expansion rate compared to Elastic’s trailing 7 quarters of greater than a 1.3x, and the most recent quarter at 142%. This may have to do with the midmarket focus, which enables greater account expansion, since the company is starting from a lower price point. The sales efficiency coefficient confirms this. Elastic charts an impressive 0.89, compared to Mulesoft’s 0.65. The sales efficiency coefficient measures gross profit increase over a period divided by sales & marketing investment. In other words how much does the company have to spend in order to generate a marginal dollar of gross profit? In terms of net income margin, both companies are on effectively the same progression, improving profitability from roughly -60% to roughly -30%. Elastic is a marvelous business. Another example of the tremendous  distribution advantages of open source software, and the sales efficiencies that can fuel the businesses that commercialize open-source software. Mulesoft sold for $6.4B in what was at the time the highest revenue to enterprise value sale for a multibillion-dollar software company. If Mulesoft’s M&A valuation is any indication, Elastic sure to be an absolutely enormous business.

The SEC announced last week that it wants to find ways to let Main Street investors access stage private venture companies . This news item underscores an important trend that is reshaping the industry. Today in Startupland, startup access is the scarcest commodity. Everybody wants an allocation, an opportunity to invest in the very best companies. The SEC story highlights how much has changed in Startupland. In this post, I’ll touch on three. First, public market investors can’t access high growth companies at the stages they once could. Second, shares in the private market trade at a premium to public market shares. The public market liquidity premium of the 90s has been replaced by a private market access premium. Third, this confluence of factors creates an opportunity for vertical integration in venture, where VCs provide capital at every stage in the company’s lifecycle: from seed to A, B through to pre-IPO rounds. Public market access to startups. In the late 1990s and early 2000, public market investors were able to buy shares at IPO at the ground floor of the business. Amazon went public with $15.7M in trailing revenues in 1997. Concur went public with $11.7M of trailing nine-month revenues in 1998. This year, Dropbox went public with $1.1B in revenue. Others include Docusign: $382M, Zuora[1]: $179M, ZScaler: $126M,. These companies are at a radically different scale than 20 years ago. Private market premium. Twenty years ago, when a startup went public, it was worth more in the public markets than the private markets. Investors were willing to pay for the liquidity premium , the ability to sell stock immediately. Today, you could say there’s an illiquidity premium. More accurately, there is a access premium. Investors pay premia for companies before they go public. This premium can be 50% or 100% depending on the business and the stage. You can’t buy shares in many of the most exciting technology companies in the public markets today at revenue and valuation ranges anywhere close to the late 90s. Vertical integration emerges as a VC strategy. If access is the scarcest resource, logic guides a venture investor to invest at the earliest stages, and then continue to buy shares through fundraising rounds as an exceptional company grows. In the previous world of venture capital, with smaller funds and capital scarcity, distributing risk made more sense. Today, capital is abundant, and concentrating ownership is a winning strategy. There are many challenges to this including signaling risk and concentration risk particularly if the market should correct; but the rewards are enormous. The venture industry is evolving. And it is demanding changes both within industry itself, and the adjacent financial markets that serve it, like the IPO market. Today, we are in an epoch where investment access is the scarcest resource, and it is becoming increasingly scarce. [1] Redpoint is an investor in this company and holds shares.

In a post earlier this week, I argued 1% of Salesforce’s revenues creates a unicorn . More broadly, I said that the biggest SaaS companies are so large, that they must have underserved customer segments. And there is an opportunity for a startup to identify that underserved segment, build a product to serve it better, and build a unicorn. I received a lot of comments about this post, but not the kind that I expected. Many people wrote me to say that 1% of revenues does not equal 1% of market capitalization. In other words, even if start of were able to win over 1% of Salesforce’s revenues, it would not equate to a $1B valuation. Also, one person accused of clickbaiting: writing an article with a misleading headline, which is something I try very hard not to do. Given that feedback, I thought it important to explain in more detail how SaaS companies are valued. In the public markets, SaaS companies are valued based on an enterprise-value-to-revenue multiple, or EV/Rev.  To calculate the enterprise value, which is the market capitalization minus debt and cash on the balance sheet, you multiple the current revenue by this multiple. Salesforce’s current EV/Rev multiple is 9.7x. Salesforce’s trailing revenue is $11.8B. $11.8B of revenue x 9.7x EV/Rev ~= $114B in enterprise value, which is Salesforce’s current enterprise value. That math works. If you were to start a competitor to Salesforce - and the financial profile of the business were roughly the same - that startup would fetch a similar multiple in the public markets. 1% of Salesforce’s revenue is $118M. $118M at a 9.7x multiple = $1.144B in enterprise value. 1% of Salesforce’s revenue would create a unicorn in the public market. In the private market, where multiples are higher, the value of the business would be greater. That’s the math behind Monday’s post.

Salesforce is worth $113 billion. 1% of $113 billion is $1.13 billion. ServiceNow is worth $34B and Workday is worth $33B. 3% of $33-34B is $1B. Atlassian is worth $20.5B. 5% of $20.5B is $1B. Why am I doing all this simple math you might ask? We have reached a point in SaaS where a small fraction of an incumbent is a billion-dollar company. If you start a business tomorrow that is able to cleave 1% of revenue from Salesforce, you will have built a billion-dollar business. 1% is not that much. For every one of the 23 software companies listed in the chart above who are worth more than $5B, there is an unhappy customer segment. A customer segment that perhaps was initially well served by the company. A customer segment whose needs have changed. A customer segment that can be identified, targeted, and better served. A customer segment that can create a billion-dollar company. For the companies worth $5B-10B, taking 10 to 20% of their customers might be a tall order today. But as they grow, the number of customer segments they serve will grow, increasing the likelihood that at least one of these groups is underserved. the industry has been looking for ways to compete with some of these incumbents for a long time. Mobile, machine learning, blockchain. All these technologies have held some promise for disruption. I suspect old-fashioned product marketing may be the disruptive force to prise $1 billion worth of market away from some of these incumbents. Identifying a customer segment, determining the features that matter most of them, performing a gap analysis to identify where the incumbents fall down, and then building a product to meet that market need. That playbook can be hugely disruptive. And in this environment, where there are 23 next-generation software companies worth $5 billion or more, the playbook can create a unicorn.

How long should you let a customer use your software before they sign a contract? You could offer them a 7 day free trial. Or 14 or 21 or 30 or 90. Longer trials might be better. The customer could delve deeper into the product, become more committed and sign a larger contract. Shorter trials drive urgency, weed out the uncommitted, and result in shorter sales cycles. Both sides have compelling arguments. Unfortunately, most SaaS startups don’t have enough samples to reach a statistically significant answer. Anecdotally, I’ve heard from many marketers shorter trials are better. The team at MadKudu analyzed 9 companies with different customer acquisition and sales strategies. Their data showed conversion rates for most of these businesses follow an S curve. I’ve copied their chart above. Two have freemium plans (A & G); three have 14 day trials (D, E & F); four have 30 day plans (B, C, H & I). Longer trials do not convert customers at greater rates. In every case but one, 50% of customers convert within 30 days. In all but three cases, 50% of customers convert by the 14th day. In fact, as the original blog post states, it’s unlikely trial length has any meaningful impact on customer conversion rate. Other factors likely have greater impact. Things like the type of sales assistance: when do inside sales reps engage the customer? What types of conversion tactics are used to push customers to pay? How long are the contracts? Price points. And many others. Fleetmatix succeeded with two day sales cycles. In its early days, Salesforce discovered the 14 day trial was the optimal length. Company A in the data above has a linear customer payment rate. There are many differences here, and to date, we haven’t been able to understand the reasons why. I’m very curious about these factors and I’d like to run a large and anonymous survey to draw some broad observations about trials and the techniques that drive effective trials. If you’d like to participate, please fill out this form . My goal is to have 100 companies participate so we can reach statistical significance in these answers. If you’d like to contribute questions or help with the survey, please let me know that too.

Jacob’s Ladder is a toy of thin wooden blocks attached by ribbon. If you hold it in your hand and rotate it to touch the second block, it seems to set off a cascade of blocks falling from the top. The blocks haven’t changed positions, though they do rotate. It’s a moving optical illusion.  When I watch this toy, I’m reminded of the current state of the fundraising market. Long-term trends in the start of fundraising market have been consistent over the last 10 years. Median round sizes have increased from 2009 dramatically across seed and Series A-C. As these round sizes have grown, there is a Jacob’s Ladder effect. In the chart above, I’ve drawn dashed lines from the values in 2009 across the graph. The dashed blue line is the median series A from 2009.  Seed rounds have not surpassed 2009 Series A levels. That part of the Jacobs Ladder has not flipped. But in 2017, the Series A median surpassed the 2009 Series B median. And in 2013, the Series B median surpassed the 2009 Series C median. Two blocks of the ladder have flipped. We still call these rounds As and Bs. Through the lens of history, they look more like Bs and Cs. Many founders have aspired to “skip” a round of financing. Raise a large enough seed to jump straight to the Series B. Or a large enough Series A to go straight to the Series C.  The truth is -  in today’s market -  the median startup is doing that already. In 2009,  the median post Series C startup counted $20.8M of investment through that period. In 2018, a post-Series B startup  would have received $26.7M in investment - skipping a round of financing. How do you skip a round of financing? In today’s market, raise the median amount. You’re one round of capital ahead of the startups ten years ago.

There are three types of product features, a seasoned head of product told me recently. MMRs, neutralizers, and differentiators. MMRs are minimum market requirements; basic features that every customer expects and demands. Neutralizers mitigate competitive threat. Differentiators are your startup’s competitive advantage. As a product manager, I’d never thought about this type of roadmap segmentation before. But it made a lot of sense to me. When a startup has established product market fit, the differentiator is clear. This feature set distinguishes the company. It is the reason customers prefer the product to alternatives. The very first buyers buy irrespective of deficiencies. The differentiator is enough to overlook those faults. As the product team talks to customers, they are likely to hear feedback encouraging more investment in MMRs and neutralizers. “Your product is missing this feature. We need this capability that exists in another piece of software in yours.” This type of product feedback is important. It has a place in the product roadmap. But it shouldn’t drive all, or arguably even the majority of engineering effort. In her experience, customers rarely push vendors to further their differentiation. By definition, the unique selling proposition doesn’t exist elsewhere in the market. So advances or improvements to the differentiator may not be obvious to customers. Example: Henry Ford’s faster horses vs a car. Features that reinforce differentiation won’t surface in customer feedback. The product management team must take responsibility for reinforcing the startup’s differentiator. Once the market recognizes the startup’s advantage, every competitor will race to replicate it. The startup must invest in that differentiation to sustain their market lead. When I was a PM, sales and support teams pushed prioritize different features that would close large accounts, or minimize competitive weaknesses and churn. The pressure can be acute: e.g., not building a feature loses an account. Push through. Defending differentiation, investing in it, and reinforcing the startup’s competitive advantage. Is there any higher priority for a product team? Does your startup’s roadmap reflect this strategic reality?

I first met Elad Gil when I became an associate product manager at Google. Back then, he had an unusual habit I noticed right away. Most people carry their laptop in the same way. The laptop is closed, in hand, between the hand and the hip. Elad carries his laptop open, powered on and by the top or bottom corner. He’s so smart and has so much cognitive bandwidth, he simply doesn’t have time to wait for the computer to wake from sleep. I’ve admired the way Elad decomposes problems and proposes solutions from those early days in Building 42. High Growth Handbook shines as a straightforward manual for startup founders. It explains the theory and the practice of building a company from his point of view and that of many luminaries. There are a few passages from the book that struck me. Marc Andreessen: “In fact, the general model for successful tech companies, contrary to myth and legend, is that they become distribution centric rather than product centric…Would you rather have another two years’ lead on product, or two years’ lead on having a state-of-the-art growth effort?” The longer I’m involved in the world of startups, the more firmly I believe this. Distribution is a long term sustainable competitive advantage. That’s what it means to be a platform: distributing other products. Cisco, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce all do this to reinforce their dominance. Claire Hughes Johnson: “I wrote a document back when I was at Google called, ‘Working with Claire.’…It spread quite quickly through the organization…I think founders should write a guide to working with them.” In the book, Elad reprints Claire’s document. Seeing a document like this inspires me to create such a document. We all figure out how to work with each other over time, but it can take years. Short circuit the process to get to a stronger working relationship. Keith Rabois: “A really great executive is six to twelve months ahead of the curve. This is a simple, clear way of articulating how to evaluate management team members that founders and board members can debate. The book spans many topics and it’s worth reading once and then keeping it on your desk. It’s an almanac for anyone starting a company. If you do buy a copy, do me this favor. When you carry it around, hold it by the corner.

Your sales team is starting to close some terrific accounts. As your startup grows, your sales team will experiment with different sales techniques. For example, qualification, pricing, positioning, incentives and contract structure. This is a wonderful phase for a startup. However, there’s a common mistake to avoid. Your VP of Finance should model the impact and approve each experiment. Many startups don’t do this at the early stages of go to market. Failing to consider the cash flow impacts can balloon your burn. Customer contracts determine how and when customers pay you. Cash flows in. Sales commission plans govern how and when your startup pays account executives. Cash flows out. The inflows and outflows should match. When the inflows and outflows align, things work well. A customer signs on, sends a check to the company. The startup receives the cash and distributes a fraction to the sales team. Mismatched cash flows create hairy problems. Let’s say a startup sells software for $250,000 ACV. This quarter, four account executives close contracts. The commission payout totals approximately 20% of the sale or $200k. Your commission plan promises sales teams payment immediately. Contracts permits customers begin to pay 60 days from now. End result: your quarterly burn just increased by at least $200k. And this scenario assumes annual upfront payment. If you promise your customers monthly payment, your cash shortfall lasts five months, not two. Worse, imagine you have paid commission to an account executive. Before the 60 day window, the customer cancels the contract. You have to decide whether claw back the sales commission from the account executive or eat the cost. Discounting also presents cash flow timing risks. Imagine the sales team offers four months free on a 16 month contract. Your startup fronts the commission four months before being paid. The impact can be serious. One startup doubled their burn in a quarter because of novel sales tactics. Bookings went through the roof and so did the burn. Because the impact became apparent more than a quarter later, it took the business more than 6 months to react burning through millions and forced an early fundraise. When experimenting with novel compensation or new sales tactics, for use in the contract, ensure that your cash flows are well-timed.

Over the weekend, I read Tien Tzuo’s book, Subscribed. Tien is the founder and CEO of Zuora, and former CSO/CMO at Salesforce, where he started in 1999. He has been working in SaaS for nearly 20 years. He’s a thought leader in the world of subscriptions, and I learned a tremendous amount from his book. There were three key themes that resonated with me. First, the shift to a subscription business model reinforces customer centricity. Second, pricing is one of the most powerful growth levers subscription companies have. Third, balancing customer mix across three-tier plans is critical to long-term success, and there is a right way to think about it. In the book, Tien talks about Fender, the guitar company.  Though tens of thousands of people have salivated over Fender’s guitars - notably Wayne Campbell and his love affair with the Stratocaster -  90% of people who pick up a guitar churn. They stop playing because it’s too hard to achieve small wins . Fender wrote a mobile application to help aspiring guitarists learn how to play music within minutes. This reduced churn by 10 percentage points, doubling the size of the market. The mobile application requires subscription, introducing a new revenue model for the business. Fender redefined the notion of a sale and customer success. Pricing is one of the most powerful growth levers you have as a subscription company. It seems like complex topic, and one I have written quite a bit about . Tien shares a simplifying viewpoint. There are only two kinds of subscription pricing: consumption and capability. Consumption pricing means charging by the seat, the API call or the CPU cycle. Capability pricing means charging by new features and functionality.  Subscription companies should choose one or the other. Many startups adopt the bronze, silver, and gold plan strategy. Tien has worked with Madhavan from Simon-Kucher, who wrote an excellent book on pricing called Monetizing Innovation .  According to Madhavan, if 70% of your customers are in the entry-level tier, your business will not survive.  The demarcation between pricing buckets is not successful. The bronze tier offers too much value. The goal is to achieve 70% of customers in silver and gold tier. We’ve been fortunate enough to partner with Tien in his journey at Zuora. Every time I see him, I learned something new, and his book was no different. It’s full of insights about how to build subscription companies from someone who has operated in the space for more than 20 years. And a leader who has facilitated the transformation of hundreds of businesses into subscription companies.

There’s a theory to the idea that winner takes most in Startupland. The startup that grows a bit faster at the beginning demonstrates more momentum. The startup raises capital sooner, hires people, builds the product, markets and sells the product, grows more, and raises capital. Repeat the process for each round of capital. Is it borne out in reality? This theory suggests that irrespective of the category, the winner should capture most of the market value. Reality is far more complicated than this simple idea. After all, most startups face turbulence in their journey. Venture capitalists finance competitors to pursue a market opportunity. M&A environments ebb and flow. Undisclosed private sales or private valuations aren’t considered. Plus, survivorship bias plagues this analysis. Setting all of that aside, I put together a basic data set across different software sectors. I examined 11 sectors which benefited from meaningful exit activity over the last 15 years. From email service providers (ESP) to application performance management (APM), I catalogued the companies who had sold or were public, and their values at time of exit or today’s market cap. Then I calculated the share of winnings per category. The analysis is far from perfect. It’s meant to be directional. We can draw a few initial observations. First, there’s quite a bit of variance in the winner’s share by sector. At the top end, Okta and Github have dominated the market for single sign on and code repositories. They define their categories. One could argue Atlassian belongs in the code repositories bucket. And that’s a good point, but it raises another complication to this type of analysis. How to divide Atlassian’s $15B market capitalization into the Bitbucket market cap and non-Bitbucket market cap? Atlassian’s public disclosures don’t break this out. At the bottom of the list, the last wave of Business Intelligence (BI) saw 4 companies with an aggregate exit market cap of about $16B. The largest, BusinessObjects, captured 41% of the exit value. Second, the median winner’s stake across categories is about two thirds. This is “consistent” with the theory, that the winner takes most. Second place takes home around 20-30% of exit market cap. Third,  it’s critical to play to win as a startup, and why being first matters so much. Dominating a market means somewhere between 50-100% of the exit market cap, an exit price 2-3x second place. This analysis isn’t exhaustive, but as a directional guide, it provides some supporting evidence that even in categories where classic network effects, data network effects or other economies of scale don’t dominate the competitive dynamics, the winner does take most in software.

Earlier this week, I wrote about the collapse in the number of seed investments . I received many questions about the data, all the same. Why is this happening? This is a deeper dive into the data. First, there are fewer seed investors participating in the market than in 2015, about 40% fewer. Second, many of the most active seed investors and institutional seed funds are investing in fewer companies. The largest accelerators in the US buck the trend, however. The lines in gray trace the investment counts by firm. The red sketches a smoothed aggregation. Third, all but one of the most active venture capital funds have reduced their seed investment activity. In aggregate volumes have declined by half. Fourth, syndicates size haven’t changed. The average number of major investors buying at the seed has remained about 2.7 investors per round throughout the gyrations of the market. And the largest party rounds have persisted of the same form, with about 20 investors. In the midst of this, seed round sizes have tripled. Seed fund sizes haven’t tripled in the same time frame. Let’s assume they’ve remained roughly the same. If each investor deploys the same amount of capital per year, then we should expect a 2/3 reduction in seed count based solely on round size increases. Which is very close to what we’ve seen in the market: a 62% reduction. In summary, startup valuations have increased. This grows the size of seed rounds. Seed investors’ funds sizes haven’t kept pace, nor has VC seed investment. To buy the same ownership, investors must invest more dollars. So they invest in fewer companies and concentrate their portfolios. What must change for the number of seed investments to increase again? More seed funds or larger seed funds must be raised, or prices must decline. The price decline can occur much more quickly than an increase in fund sizes, and that’s the more likely of the two changes. But there’s nothing on the horizon that suggests a repricing in the market today.

In the last six years, the median time between seed and Series A has more than tripled from about 200 days to about 750 days. Why? The seed market is in the midst of some secular changes. Seed rounds have declined 63% from their peak . Total dollars invested have fallen by 37% . But the median round size is up 3x in the same time period. In other words, investors are concentrating capital in fewer startups. Consequently, this smaller number of startups has substantially longer runway, fueling a longer gestation period to series A. In 2011,  the median startup raised a $0.5M seed and a $3M Series A 9 months later. Today, the median startup raises a $1.5M seed and an $8M Series A 22 months later. Some of these startups wait more than 2 years, up to 6, 7 or 8 years, to raise the Series A. The 75th percentile raise money in about a year. The 50th percentile raise money in about 2 years and the 25th percentile raise in just over 3 years. The increase in seed round sizes explains about 80% of the lengthening time between seed and Series A (R^2 is 0.78). In the meantime, the number of series As has only declined 20% from its high, remaining relatively stable from 2014 through 2018. This means that the odds of a seed stage company raising a Series A have improved markedly in the last year. In 2013, there was one Series A for every five seed investments. In the second quarter of 2018, there were three Series As for every five seeds. Startups benefit from the incredibly supportive financial environment. This is resulting in several different and important trends. Startups can invest in deep technology by building machine learning software that might take a year or two to bring to the market. Or startups might commercialize hardware, another category where time-to-market is slower than classic SaaS. Last, startups can benefit from a longer period to experiment, and find true product market fit. The ostensible corollary to this is that series A investors expect more at the series A than they would have in the past, because startups have more time and cash. But that’s not reflected in my data. The average Series A company I’ve met in the last 12 or so months generates $732k in ARR, or about $61k in MRR, far from the $1M+ ARR quoted by most founders as their target. In other words, round sizes have increased and though some startups may make more progress or invest in deep technology to create a moat, the prevailing dynamic in the fundraising market is an overwhelmingly supportive fundraising environment, aka an oversupply of capital. That oversupply has convinced some investors to reduce their exposure or pull out of the market almost altogether . For now, though, the Series A market is the strongest its been since 2010.

Earlier this week, Redpoint announced its 7th stage fund of $400M. Over the past 10 years that I’ve been Redpoint, I have seen our firm learn, evolve and grow in many different ways - important ways - that fill me with gratitude and pride. First, we have and will continue to plant trees we will not see . Our founders who started the firm about 20 years ago built the firm to endure for decades. They taught us the business and invested consistently in the future of firm. We plant trees outside the firm by contributing knowledge and connections through events, publishing and networking. Second, we’ve reinforced key values that have always been, and will always be core, to our culture. We have five: founders first, think independently together ( brutal intellectual honesty );  open source the org (transparency inside and out); move as one, have fun (team first, individual second; laugh a lot); make it happen (actions over words). We take them seriously, but not too seriously . Third, because of this strong culture, we’ve been lucky to find ourselves surrounded by a wonderful team who we believe make great long term partners to startup founders. One ran a billion dollar business unit at the largest SaaS company in the world. Another was a key part of the team that built a business that grew from 0-$100m in revenue in 12 months . Amongst us we have serial founders, executives and operators, and deep subject matter experts who understand startups because they’ve been there. Fourth, we’ve partnered with mission-focused limited partners. Their success funds education initiatives, healthcare improvements, environmental restoration, and cultural investments to improve the world in areas outside of technology. Fifth, all of these efforts and many more behind the scenes have one common purpose: to serve entrepreneurs. Those intrepid and bold people who brave risk, uncertainty and turbulence to change the world. For that privilege to serve, I am grateful.

Imagine you come across three builders working on the same project. You ask each the same question: what are you working on? The first says, “I lay one brick after the other.” The second says, “I’m building a wall.” The third, “I’m erecting a cathedral.” What is the moral of this aphorism? I see two. The first is to keep the greater vision of our work in mind. Said another way, “If you wish to build a ship, do not divide the men into teams and send them to the forest to cut wood. Instead, teach them to long for the vast and endless sea .” The second is we work on different levels. Without the vision of the cathedral, we may never motivate ourselves to achieve grandeur. Instead, we might create a cluster of one-room, square red brick houses. Equally true: without the focus on the bricks or the wall, the cathedral will never be built. A grand vision lacking execution is just a dream. It’s really hard to keep these three levels in mind all the time. I find myself trying to lay bricks as quickly as possible most days, forgetting about the evolution of the wall, much less the cathedral. OKRs, Quarterly goal reviews and annual reviews certainly help. And I’ve tried to find a technique to translate those into weekly tasks. Recently, I’ve even begun categorizing how I spend my time each week to make certain it aligns with my quarterly goals. I’ve been inspired by some amazing founders and partners who focus intensely on just their top three priorities. I envy their tenacity and focus on the daily masonry while maintaining a sense of the wall’s progress and the cathedral’s evolution.

We’re excited to announce our partnership with and investment in Kustomer . Kustomer is a New York City-based company building the next-generation of customer support platform. In my first role at Google, I provided account management and customer support to internet publishers. I remember trying to understand the context around a particular customer case. How large is the customer? What recent interactions have we had with the customer? How satisfied are they? Who is the point of contact? Which products are they using? The information was found in five or six different systems. I also remember trying to remediate problems. Some were simple. Password reset or account balance inquiries. But others required coordination with different systems and teams: refunds and policy review. Orchestrating those processes isn’t easy. Kustomer is the software I wish I had when supporting customers. Brad, Jeremy and the rest of the Kustomer team have operated in the space for more than a decade. They were founders of Assistly (with our partner Alex Bard), and became executives at Salesforce’s Service Cloud after Salesforce bought their business. They have seen companies of all types and sizes struggle to find the right way to support their customers. The product of all that experience and knowledge is Kustomer. Kustomer has a flexible data model to ingest all relevant data to a customer interaction, from web visits to mobile interactions, from transactions to event attendance. Kustomer couples this data store to a powerful process engine that enables orchestration and automation of other systems. For example, customer support reps can process a return and create a new order at the click of a button. This is a powerful combination. It’s the reason companies like Ring, Slice, Glossier, SmugMug and others trust their most important relationships - those with their customers - to Kustomer.

2018 is a blockbuster year for software M&A multiples. The prices companies fetch relative to their revenues surpass any of those in the past 7 years. Billion-dollar plus acquisitions in 2018 have commanded a median 17.7x trailing enterprise value to revenue multiple. Nothing in the past seven years is close. In fact, there is not a single acquisition in that range. In 2018, three acquirers have paid greater than 14x trailing multiples, and two have paid greater than 20x trailing. The vibrant M&A market we expected is fructifying. Growth remains the most important correlating factor to sale price. The strength of the correlation has fallen a bit since we calculated this earlier in the year from 0.72 to 0.68. That small decline is driven by Cisco’s acquisition of Broadsoft earlier in 2018, but does nothing to change the conclusion that acquirers prize growth. The major forces at play at the beginning of the year remain influential today. Consequently, I expect substantially more acquisitions of the scale and at these multiples through 2018. The corporate tax holiday. The growing sizes of the software market. The desire for continuing growth. The pace of innovation within software. The increasing competition amongst incumbents. A vibrant public market that is continuing to price companies aggressively. As I wrote earlier this week, forward software multiples have reached eight year highs at 8.5x EV/NTM revenues. It’s a great time to sell a fast growing billion dollar company. Full data below.

Last week, Microsoft acquired Github for $7.5B. It’s a massive acquisition at a massive price relative to other software acquisitions. Why is Microsoft willing to pay so much? Developer identity . Identity has been critical to Microsoft success. Active Directory (AD) forms nexus of the Microsoft enterprise ecosystem. AD contains all the users, their roles, and their rights.   The Skype acquisition was also about identity, consumer identity. Github brings identity of a third important demographic: developers. Hard left toward open source . Satya Nadella has pivoted Microsoft toward open source  since he became CEO. These are some of the efforts. Microsoft supports Ubuntu on Windows 10. Microsoft has published Linux and FreeBSD for Azure. Microsoft bought Xamarin to help open source .NET. That’s the beginning. There are plenty more open source initiatives here . This acquisition capstones the commitment. Box-out Amazon and Google in the Cloud Wars . “Every” business is moving to the cloud. They will migrate applications, data and code. Microsoft now owns the largest repository of open source software, and the most popular version control system. To migrate enterprise on-prem code to Azure is a huge competitive advantage. It will be easier than any alternative. Cross-sell Github enterprise . Enterprises pay millions of dollars for Github enterprise. Microsoft has one of the largest enterprise customer bases globally. Mix the two, chill, and shake, and you have a new billion dollar revenue business unit for Microsoft. Anticipate the serverless and function-as-a-Service (FaaS) wave . Serverless is a movement in the developer ecosystem. For the past 15 years, developers have shared open source applications and libraries. Today, developers have begun to publish and share individual functions. Imagine pushing a button on Github to instantiate a function or an application. Elegant on-ramp for a developer to become a paying Azure customer. M**&A Intelligence.** Microsoft will observe which open source projects gain momentum. With that first party data set, they can acquire or compete with the teams building those technologies. Network effects. There are very few enterprise companies with network effects. Github is one. They should enjoy winner-take-most dynamics within the developer ecosystem. Microsoft’s acquisition of Github is a bold strategic bet that will position Microsoft at the forefront of open-source and reinforce their strength in the Cloud Wars.

You’ve just raised a round of financing. Your next step is to build your management team.  There are several criteria for finding the right executive. Competency in the field, cultural fit, communication skills, management experience. All of those should be obvious. There is one that is often overlooked. Network. Recruiting is one of the most important responsibilities for a head of a department. That head will need to scale the team to meet the objectives of the company. Within the first 3 to 6 months, the executive will likely hire several people, maybe 4 maybe 10. What is the first place an executive will mine for talent? Her network. The people she has worked with in the past. The people she has met in the industry. The relationships she has cultivated over her tenure. Those are the first set of candidates to come through the door. You want to be able to hire to those candidates for four reasons. First, you already have a strong reference on their behalf, so there’s less screening required. Second, there’s no leadership/relationship risk. The team already knows each other. Third, they are likely to move very quickly and follow a great person to another role, which accelerates hiring. Fourth, great people associate with other great people. More trusted referrals means faster, easier and better hiring. That’s terrific leverage. Without that network or with the wrong network, recruiting costs and time increase. Success rates of new hires declines. And more uncertainty is injected into the business. When interviewing for new executive to lead an internal team, interview for the network by asking and digging into the question: “Who are your first 5 hires?”

There are five forces driving the startup ecosystem today. They are working together to reinforce a high valuation environment. These forces are: An infusion of capital into Startupland. There are many reasons for this. The money supply in the US has doubled in the last 10 years . A low interest rate environment means a low cost of capital, which means yield is hard to find for cash. VCs raise larger funds and more frequently. Core funds, opportunity funds, supergrowth funds. Private capital has become so abundant that it supplies hundreds of millions and billions to startups. In addition to the size, venture capitalists are raising funds more frequently. Instead of every three years, many VCs are raising every two years. Greater dollars means more competition. And we all know what happens when demand exceeds supply: prices increase. Market maturity. Software models are well understood. Many of the metrics that formerly were applied only to public companies are now applied to SaaS companies. We talk about valuation as a function of new quarterly bookings or revenue multiples/ARR multiples, even at the early stages. There are standard metrics for sales, customer success in marketing efficiency that are used broadly within the industry. There are books written about the ways to build a go to market for software company. All of this means more efficient pricing of startups. Aggressive Acquisition Market and Strong Multiples in the IPO Market. SaaS forward multiples are at ten year highs. The average forward multiple is now 8.5x. This means public companies are worth more when they go public and as they are public. Acquisitions also occur at much larger multiples. The recent Github and Mulesoft acquisitions occurred at astounding multiples relative to public comparables . When startups are valued this highly in the late stage markets and the public markets, the effect is also felt in earlier rounds. Balance Sheets as Competitive Advantage. Balance sheet sizes have become a moat. In addition to technology, network effects, and expertise, a startup’s cash position is a competitive advantage. Imagine two startups in the same space with similar funding. The one that can raise a $250m round from a later stage mega-fund suddenly has a huge and difficult-to-assail advantage. The question is whether the trade is positive, negative or neutral for founders and investors. For founders, greater access to capital at higher valuations from investors who understand these models better than in the past are all positives. The downside may be the greater expectations placed on the ultimate value of the companies and the potential risk of a pricing correction on the business. Maintaining a plan to short term profitability is the best hedge to that risk. For investors, this environment also has many benefits. There is a larger universe of investors to invest in companies at later stages, increasing fundraising likelihood. Subsequent rounds are completed at higher valuations, boosting IRR and paper multiples. M&A and IPO occur at higher valuations. On the downside, entry price is higher, concentrating portfolios. All of this works until it doesn’t. Should there be a correction in multiples or prices, then there will be pain. Until then, the music continues to play.

Imagine you came across this ad. Scientists have discovered a revolutionary new treatment that makes you live longer. It enhances your memory and makes you more creative. It makes you look more attractive. It keeps you slim and lowers food cravings. It protects you from cancer and dementia. It wards off colds and the flu. It lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke, not to mention diabetes. You’ll even feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious. Are you interested? It’s not a tea cleanse or a keto-diet, but sleep. I’ve just read Why We Sleep , a book by Professor Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at Berkeley. He outlines the research supporting these claims. Despite the fact that’s we’ve not yet finished May, I’m convinced Why We Sleep is the most important book I’ll have read this year. “I’ll sleep when I’m dead,” is a mantra I picked up and adopted at some point in high school and carried through to my first job as a software engineer. End result: in the emergency room with pneumonia on Christmas Eve. Secondary result that is much harder to quantify: enormous technical debt from bad judgement! It’s one thing to be told that sleep is important. It’s another entirely to read about the experiments that prove the performance gains of people who sleep enough and well. And enough isn’t 4 or 5 or 6 hours. Though some subset of people do benefit from a genetic mutation that requires less sleep, that population when rounded is zero. Most people need at least 7 hours, consistently. How impactful is a lack of sleep? If you sleep between 5 and 6 hours, your chances of suffering an accident in your car double. If you sleep 4-5 hours, they quadruple and anything less than four hours increases the odds by an order of magnitude. Drowsy driving accounts for more fatalities on US roads than drugs and drinking combined. As I read this book, I asked myself: Would I make a $1M investment in the stock market after a few glasses of wine? Would you? A $1M investment for a venture capitalist might be a marketing campaign for another business, or hiring a VP Sales and four account executives for a startup for a year. We make these types of decisions (and smaller and larger ones) frequently. Sleep is a key ingredient to ensuring we’re making the right call.

Technology innovations swing to a pendulum’s cadence. Sometimes innovations begin with infrastructure changes and reverberate up the stack. Other times, front-end engineers innovate at the application layer, which demand downstream changes in the infrastructure to scale. The last major epoch of front end evolution has celebrated its ten year anniversary. We’re in a period of punctuated equilibrium. When will we see rapid speciation? Web 2.0 and mobile applications built on iPhone and Android transformed the way users interacted with technology. One could argue there have been innovations at the platform tier. React changed front end deployment, for example. But aside from touch interfaces and the elimination of the page refresh with each click, not much has changed in human computer interaction in a decade. In contrast, in the last five or ten years, infrastructure has been reinvented, revolutionized, reborn. Infrastructure-as-a-service provided by Amazon, Google and Microsoft among others empowers applications to scale as users demand. New databases like Hadoop, Cassandra, Cockroach/Spanner, Mongo, Blockchain store and retrieve data faster, at larger scale, across geographies or in untrusted environments. Kubernetes, containers, serverless, continuous deployment have transformed software building. These technologies fomented a movement that has changed software engineering:  devops. Devops combines the responsibilities of software developers and infrastructure operations. New  machine-learning APIs transcribe speech, categorize text, recognize images, translate words, and predict.  Available off the shelf and cheap, their accuracy hurtles toward human superiority with staggering speed. So when will all these innovations alloy to fundamentally change how we interact with software? Perhaps the most successful, Alexa and Google Home are the first mass-market, human-computer interface without a screen. Tens of millions of homes now operate with an invisible, audible interface to the internet. Ambient computing. In the enterprise, however, not much has changed. Today’s SaaS interfaces are nearly identical to their older brothers: databases with web forms on top. Advances like chatbots haven’t yet impacted software use at scale. Voice isn’t broadly used to input data. Perhaps the advances in infrastructure should reduce software cost. Better tools translate to lower expenses? Today, software infrastructure costs are not meaningful compared to customer support and may sap five or ten points of gross margin, which won’t result in a price delta buyers will notice. The software innovation pendulum will change direction. The infrastructure renaissance have built the foundations of new front end cathedrals, which will redefine human computer interaction in SaaS. If you’ve seen one of these new interfaces, let me know by emailing me or sending me a tweet.

I remember the first time I wrote an OKR (objective and key result) at Google. “You should set your goals so that you attain 70%. That’s success,” my manager told me. “Even better if you have a moonshot goal in there, with a 5% likelihood of success.” I was uneasy with calling 70% goal achievement as success. The habits formed from 17 years of schooling and a 100 point scale run deep. John Doerr’s book Measure What Matters is a paean to the OKR. Andy Grove introduces Doerr to the idea at Intel and Doerr brings the concept to Google. Several years later, I found myself writing them. An OKR is a an objective with a key result. The objective is a goal. The key result is a quantified measure of success.` There are many goal management techniques, each with positives and negatives. I found OKRs effective for two reasons because of the way Google deployed them. First, the OKR process aligns the company from top to bottom. The company leadership set corporate OKRs. Then SVPs decomposed those company OKRs into goals for their divisions and teams. The VPs would do the same, and the directors, and the team leads and the individual contributors. This recursive deconstruction linked the highest level goals to the work of individuals. Second, the OKR construct reinforced greater ambition. Quoting from the book: said Edwin Locke, “hard goals” drive performance more effectively than easy goals. Second, specific hard goals “produce a higher level of output” than vaguely worded ones. The 70% attainment idea, that success is 70%, reinforced the notion of hard goals.  The key result component of the OKR complemented the pair with specifics. OKRs demand an investment and a commitment to the process. But teams using OKRs enjoy a better aligned and more ambitious work culture. If you’d like to learn more about OKRs in startups, First Round has a wonderful overview . Doerr refers to OKRs as the first gift he gave Google. OKRs are a gift. They are a process, a leading indicator of success, discipline and ambition .

At Redpoint’s annual investor meeting earlier this year, I quipped, “The day-trading taxi drivers of the dotcom era have been replaced by crypto-trading Uber drivers.” But over the weekend, a grizzled Uber driver with a mane of grey hair and wind-and-sunburnt cheeks asked me about crypto. “Can you explain to me why public key/private key technology is important on the Blockchain?” He pointed out the Bitcoin ATM that charges 10% from his cigarette-infused Prius. “That’s for suckers; Coinbase charges only 2%,” he said as we whizzed past. A former yacht broker and pilot, he likened crypto  to Powerball. “I can put in a few bucks, buy some Dogecoin or Jesuscoin , and maybe it goes up 100x overnight and I’ve changed my life. I like Monero, too.” A few hours later, as I boarded the plane home, I read Fred Wilson’s post on Buffett and Munger’s critique of cryptocurrency investing . Buffett and Munger argue that buying crypto isn’t investing but speculating. You aren’t investing when you do [buy crypto]. You’re speculating. There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow, that’s one kind of game. That is not investing. Buffett and Munger aren’t technology investors. They said as much on page 6 of Berkshire’s 2007 shareholder letter . They look to invest in “enduring businesses.” Our criterion of “enduring” causes us to rule out companies in industries prone to rapid and continuous change. Though capitalism’s “creative destruction” is highly beneficial for society, it precludes investment certainty…A truly great business must have an enduring “moat” that protects excellent returns on invested capital The letter highlights See’s Candy, a West Coast chocolate maker Buffett bought decades ago for $25M. Since its purchase, See’s generated $1.4B in cash for Berkshire, and required only $32M in incremental investment. A 24x return in 30 years. The company has built a moat with its strong brand. As the plane reached 10,000 feet and I pulled out my laptop, I read about last week’s Tesla earning call. An analyst asked Musk a question about Buffett’s view on moats. I think moats are lame. They are like nice in a sort of quaint, vestigial way. If your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace of innovation, that is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness. Buffett and Munger got wind of Musk’s critiques. The three bounced barbs through the press over the next few days, with Musk finally retorting: Loeb, Musk and Wilson share one world view. Buffett and Munger hold the opposite point of view. The speculators believe great investments develop competitive advantage through innovation, disruption and displacement. The investors advocate competitive advantage prevents disruption and displacement. Both camps have proven their theories correct and generated billions of returns for their investors. Of course, I favor the speculator’s point of view. In the Zurich Axioms , a book written by an American journalist educated at Princeton named Max Gunther . He quoted Gerald Loeb , author of one of my favorite investment books called The Battle for Investment Survival . “All investment is speculation. The only difference is that some people admit it and some don’t.” Irrespective of your point of view, the crucial lesson in all this - whether you’re a venture capitalist, crypto-buying Uber driver, or billionaire private equity buyer - stick to your strategy. The VCs and founders play an offense-only game. They speculate and bet on disruption to win. On the other side of the coin, Munger and Buffett play defense; maintain the status quo and milk the profits. To mix them would result in defeat - and a lot of soggy candy.

There’s the challenge of dealing with uncertainty, where you’re operating in the weird zone that you’re making decisions that have significant long term impact or that are difficult to reverse or course-correct in the face of great uncertainty. Uncertainty is often unnecessary in the sense that you could, in principle, reduce the uncertainty. You could go research the question more. You could obtain more information, or run an experiment. It’s not cosmic uncertainty, without absolute knowability. When there’s true, deep, un-mitigatable uncertainty then it’s not to hard to say, “we’re just going to choose something and make the best decision we can.” There’s a more frustrating uncertainty. When the uncertainty is not necessary. But the thing that’s limited is the cost in obtaining further information to reduce that uncertainty. And so you’re left in a dissatisfying situation in which I have to make a highly consequential decision with a lot of uncertainty. We could have less uncertainty, we could take steps to mitigate that, but we just don’t have time to. Patrick Collison said this in a recent interview with the Knowledge Project . It’s a brilliant description of one of the most challenging parts of startups and business more broadly. Leaders must constantly decide critical decisons with limited information, and quickly. The management team of a company is a decision-making and productivity chokepoint.  Critical decisions flow through them. If the management team ruminates on most decisions, the company’s progress stalls. In a 100 person startup, five slow-to-decide executives limit the productivity of 95 employees.  In a 1000 person startup, the ratio might be 10:990. There’s enormous leverage in a hierarchical organization if the leadership moves quickly. The converse is equally true. Sluggish decision-making halts all progress. The cost of deciding slowly seems small. Just a day or a week of more research; one more experiment. But a day’s delay in a 1000 person organization costs the company more than $400k in lost productivity. Deciding quickly implies becoming more comfortable with three things. First, not making a decision is a decision itself. Second, identifying when you have sufficient information to decide. Third, reconciling yourself that you will often be wrong. To seize a startup’s advantage - focus and speed - and to leverage it to create enduring businesses means wrestling with uncertainty every day, fighting that frustration, and dispatching decisions quickly based on sub-optimal information.

“Don’t be so hard on yourself when things go badly and don’t be so proud of yourself when they go well.” I think this is one of the hardest pieces of advice to follow. Chance is an important contributor to any outcome.  sometimes we just get lucky. That recent crypto trade in which you made 25% in an hour. The time you met your significant other for the first time. The hiring decision in your startup that was a wild guess, but worked out beautifully. Annie Duke, a professional poker player , said the quote above. In hold ’em poker, you may draw a King-high straight flush, one of the strongest hands in the game, and yet lose all your money. The odds are 1.5 million to 1. But you can still bust. In a recent interview, Duke talked about distinguishing the quality of the outcome and the quality of the decision. Like all really important concepts in life and business, this idea can be distilled into a 2 x 2 matrix 1 . On one axis we have quality of outcome. On the vertical axis: quality of decision-making process. Of course we always want to be in the top right.  A well-thought-out decision-making process leads to a terrific outcome. Most of the time, we’re going to oscillate between “I’m feeling lucky,”  a poor decision-making leads to a great outcome, and “Bummer, on to the next one,” when a good decision-making process leads to a poor outcome. The wisdom in Duke’s advice is to focus on the process, because eventually the right process will lead to great outcomes. Bill Walsh echoes this feedback in his book, The Score Takes Care Of Itself. Walsh relates the story of the turnaround of the San Francisco 49ers and the importance of discipline and process. Success is a lagging indicator. Processes are proxy metrics , leading indicators of success. Processes establish some degree of repeatability in a world where chance roams freely. 1. Don’t believe everything you read.

The venture capital markets are flush with capital. We’re approaching the heady days of the dot com era. In that epoch, despite the record volumes of venture dollars, startups went public quickly, in 4-5 years. Today, that timeframe is no longer realistic. In fact, the surfeit of private dollars delay IPOs. From 2000-2005, the “typical” IPO-bound startup listed on an exchange 5 years after founding. After the Lehman collapse and the crisis of 2008, the IPO closed, and startup age spiked to 16 years median. Since then, the trend has continued. 2017 and 2018 IPO startups are 11 years old when they do go public, more than double the early aughts. The corollary to delayed IPOs: great companies age like bacterial colonies. They grow bigger with time. In 2017, the median company generated more than $160M in revenue. In 2018, the median IPO generated more than $340M. Will this trend continue? If the private markets remain flush with capital, it’s very likely. Startups raise at better multiples in the private markets than the publics. The same amount of capital at less dilution is a compelling proposition. But at some point, you want to move out of the basement . The liquidity and cachet of being public still trumps the marginal reduction of dilution.

“When I die, I want all the people with whom I worked on group projects to lower me into my grave, so they can let me down one last time.” Someone once sent me this e-card as a joke. I laughed and laughed, and never forgot it. I can’t remember a school group project which teammembers contributed equally. Paradoxically, I bet everyone in the group felt the same way. There’s a good reason I bristled in those group projects. Every person in a team overestimates his or her contributions to the team . The bigger the team, the greater the overestimation - “especially when group members’ unequal responsibility allocations are made explicit.” Add an egocentrist, someone who takes more credit, and the social dynamics boil. Why does this happen? I suffer from a terrible bias. I know intimately the hardships and sacrifices I make. The late nights. Dead ends. Frustrations from mistakes. I see myself toil. But I fail to consider the work of others in as much detail. My teammates grind as much as I do. But I don’t see it. I’m myopic, nearsighted and focus on my travails. And I start to say things like “I deserve,” a toxic word . How do I change? Ask me to consider the work others have done in great detail. My one-sidedness receds. My bias evaporates. This overestimation bias is a important contributor to team dysfunction. And it’s a reason why constant communication engenders healthy teams. The more visibility teammates have into each other’s work, the greater the sense of common sacrifice and camaraderie. Daily standups. Weekly all hands. Spot bonuses. Quarterly business reviews. These tools to spill sunshine on each of the teammates’ contributions. Those rays benefit the entire team. If you observe myopia in your team, shine some light on the great work others are doing. Everyone will benefit.

Ten years ago, Guy Kawasaki took this photograph of me . I was attending my first YCombinator Demo Day, maybe three months into my time at Redpoint. Much has changed. I’m am not as young or as green. YCombinator has thrived and scaled. And the startup demo has disappeared. At that August Demo Day, each pitch lasted eight minutes. Without fail each featured a demonstration of the product. It was the height of the Web 2.0 era. The iPhone was just a year old and mobile hadn’t blossomed yet. The web was still the center of innovation. And the demo provided founders a chance to explain these innovations. I felt like I was seeing a wisp of the future incarnated in code. For example, this is Sachin Agarwal, the founder and CEO of Posterous. He was showing the audience how to create a blog post from an email. We were taken by the simplicity of the product and Redpoint led the Series A in Posterous shortly after this. Today, demo days are a misnomer. We should call them metrics days. Market size. Weekly growth rate. Net negative churn. The same is true for fundraising pitches. Most of the founders I meet never show their product in the meeting. The fundraising pitches of 2008 highlighted leading indicators of success: the product, the vision, the team. Today, we concentrate on lagging indicators of success: metrics. I’ll be the first to say metrics can be an important part of a story. But I think we’ve lost quite a lot along the way in scrapping the demo. The best partnerships between founders and investors are those formed with a shared vision of the future, and a passion to see it through. You can’t inspire that commitment on numbers alone.

The average English sentence has been shortened by half over the last five hundred years . Read the first sentence of the Declaration of Independence to see why. It is 71 words long and contains 8 recursive clauses. I read it ten times before I understood it. I have 48 seconds with you , my reader. No time to mince words.  To reach more people with your content, shorten your sentences and ditch the jargon. Why do we see jargon in business? The narrower the group of speakers, the more impenetrable the language. Linguists have observed this in Native American tongues. the Mohawk word sahonwanhotónkwahse conveys as much meaning as the English sentence “She opened the door for him again.” In English, you need two clauses (one embedded inside the other) to say “He says she’s leaving,” but in Yup’ik, a language spoken in Alaska, you can use a single word, “Ayagnia.” (Ayagniuq, in contrast, means “He says he himself is leaving”; Ayagtuq means, more simply, “He’s leaving.”) The Rise and Fall of the English Sentence by Judy Sedivy This isn’t just the case in exotic languages; these patterns appear in English. Sedivy points to terms in scientific journals like state hate crime victim numbers. Five nouns in a row to describe an idea. In SaaS, and on this blog, we use acronyms. ACV, MTR, CAC, MRR. And insider terms like  months to repay,  sales efficiency, and cash flow margin. Each time I write in SaaS slang, I receive an email from one or a few readers asking for a definition. A reminder that my content isn’t as effective as it could be. Speakers within a small, tight-knit community have an immense store of shared knowledge. This allows shortcuts in communicating with each other, so that many aspects of communication…writing stretches the distance between participants even wider, allowing writers to communicate with unseen readers across expanses of time and space… There is value to addressing a small group of experts with focused language. Use argot deliberately. To maximize reach, shorten those sentences and write simply and clearly. You’ll invite new people into your world to learn your language. And you’ll earn the trust to be their guide, which is the goal of all great content marketing.

A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. This statement underpins all of finance. The idea has a fancy name: the Time Value of Money. It applies to all types of investments, including startups. Time Value of Money is the economic argument for startups to raise money when it’s available. If I give you a million dollars today, you can invest it. You might buy 151 bitcoins. Or invest in a certificate of deposit at 1.5%. Or pay a team of four engineers to build a feature for your software startup. Each of these are investments with some risk and some potential reward. If I promise you a million dollars a year from now, that’s worth much less. Bitcoin might 10x in that time, and you wouldn’t have missed the rally. You would have lost $15k in interest income from the CD. You would have to wait to build the feature that could have won your startup more business. Cash today empowers the holder to buy options. The more cash today, the broader the option portfolio available to the CEO. The CEO is the asset allocator in chief . He or she decides which options to buy. The more cash the company has, the more options are available. Google has $102B in cash. They can afford many options. And very expensive ones. Google calls them Moonshots: self-driving cars and lengthening human longevity. This investment portfolio diversifies the risk of company success in the long term. A startup with $1M in cash has far fewer options - maybe just one or two - which is why focus is critical. The investment they make must succeed, else the business fails. There’s another reason Time Value of Money matters to startups. Cost of capital. It doesn’t cost Google much to raise $1M. They are big and have great credit, a big balance sheet and many assets. They can borrow at the best rates. On the other hand, a startup must pay a much higher price to raise capital, either debt or equity. The startup is a much riskier investment. This cost of capital is also called the discount rate. The greater the discount rate, the more a dollar today is worth relative to a dollar in the future. Here’s the formula to calculate the ratio: Present_value = Future_value / (1 +cost_of_capital) number_of_years Raise money when you can. You’ll access more options and provide the business a broader universe of paths to success.

The Ideal Customer Profile. The perfect customer. Can you describe it for your startup? The more precisely you can describe it, the better. That will simplify disqualification . But articulating the ICP well isn’t enough. Vague ICPs are problematic. The company will focus on too broad a customer base, waste time and effort with unqualified prospects, and blunt their sales pitch with irrelevant value propositions. Clear ICPs can also be problematic. To describe the ideal customer well is not enough. Let’s use an example. A clear but useless ICP might be: a disenchanted thirtysomething mechanic who likes to play German board games, read Nietzsche and watch MMA. I can clearly articulate my ICP to myself and others. The target market is clear (and niche!) But how do I identify this person if I’m looking to sell to him? Where do I begin generating leads? Mechanics meetups? Board game conventions? Nihilist forums? A good ICP must serve three purposes. First, the ICP should enable me to identify a good prospect quickly. Second, I should be able to simply convey the ICP to someone else in such a way they can find other ICPs. Third, the ICP should be defined so systems can be built to identify them. A better ICP is: VPs of Marketing in GDPR affected regions; or heads of sales with teams larger than 50 people in technology; CEOs of profitable pool supply companies. These ICPs are much easier to identify using lead generation tools. They can be communicated to teammates simply and computer systems can be tooled or trained to identify them at scale. To grow, startups must scale and distribute ICP identification from one to ten to hundreds of people. A narrow, clear, and identifiable ICP is a critical ingredient in that growth.

Yesterday, Salesforce announced it will acquire Mulesoft for $6.5B. A recent addition to the list of public software companies, Mulesoft is a tremendous business . The company generated $297M of revenue in 2017 at a 73% gross margin, and grew by 58%. Salesforce is acquiring the business for an astounding 21x enterprise value to trailing twelve months revenue multiple - nearly 2x the next closest. Transaction Price ($M) TTM Rev ($M) Growth Rate Gross Margin Year of Acquisition Enterprise Value EV/TTM Rev Salesforce/Mulesoft 6,500 297 58% 73% 2018 6,296 21.0 SAP/Concur 8,300 546 32% 63% 2014 5,988 11.0 SAP/SuccessFactors 3,764 328 59% 66% 2011 3,599 11.0 Salesforce/Demandware 2,800 274 40% 71% 2016 2,502 9.1 Oracle/Eloqua 957 95.8 34% 72% 2012 864 9.0 SAP/Callidus 2,400 253 22% 61% 2018 2,247 9.0 SAP/Ariba 4,607 517 27% 66% 2012 4,390 8.5 Microsoft/LinkedIn 26,500 3615 30% 87% 2016 24,385 6.7 Oracle/Responsys 1,770 194 25% 53% 2013 1,291 6.7 Oracle/Taleo 1,921 315 33% 67% 2012 1,805 5.7 IBM/Kenexa 1,397 333 25% 61% 2012 1,332 4.0 If we compare this acquisition on other dimensions, we see that Mulesoft is the second fastest growing at the time of acquisition, next to SuccessFactors in 2011. The gross margin is second highest to LinkedIn, and close to Eloqua and Demandware. On this list, the Mulesoft is second to LinkedIn. For acquirers of software companies, one thing seems to matter: growth at scale. A business that generates several hundred million per revenue of revenue and is growing at greater than 50% has fetched a greater than 10x EV/TTM revenue multiple. Growth is the best predictor of mulitple, with a 0.72 R^2. One of my 7 predictions for 2018 was: The tax holiday for repatriation creates one of the most active M&A environments of the past ten years. In the first three months of 2018, we’ve witnessed two multibillion dollar software acquisitions. And we’re sure to see more. The data suggests that these acquisitions will be completed at some of the highest multiples of the last decade, especially for the fastest growing companies.

Recently, people have been asking just where are we in the SaaS valuation cycle. I last updated the chart above more than six months ago.  The answer is close to ten year highs. The chart above shows the median enterprise value to forward revenue multiple to multiple. Enterprise value is the market of a publicly traded company minus the available cash the company holds. Forward revenue is the sum of the next 12 months’ revenue. Since 2013, we seen an incredible amount of volatility in SaaS forward multiples. The peak occurred in February 2014 at 7.7x. The nadir followed almost exactly 2 years later. A 57% drop in multiples occurred when public investors rotated from growth stocks into value stocks. Since that moment, SaaS multiples have more than doubled from to 7.2x. Not every name has benefited, but nearly all of them have. Only six companies have witnessed multiple compression over the last 12 months. The average company has witnessed a 27% increase in multiple. This multiple expansion is substantial. RingCentral, Qualys, LivePerson and Hortonworks have all seen a greater than 66% increase in multiple expansion. RingCentral leads the list at a 106% expansion. In other words, the business is twice as valuable today as it was a year ago, at the same revenue. So just where are these numbers?  Let’s talk about them in absolutes. Shopify, Atlassian, Xero and 2U top the list.  Here is an amazing fact: the top 3 companies all target the SMB segment with ASPs at IPO of under $10k. Each of these business has top of the charts sales efficiency. The next four are enterprise software companies. 2U (education), Service Now (operations), Veeva (healthcare sales) and Workday (human resources) aren’t far behind with 9.7x+ forward multiples. Where does that leave the environment? Close to ten year highs. There are significant tailwinds for these businesses. SaaS is winning ever greater marketshare across all these segments. And the public market is rewarding this potential for growth with handsome forward multiples.

In the US, the median seed round has nearly quadrupled over the past seven years. In the mean time, seed investment has grown more than 7x and then fallen to a bit more than half of the high. As the market has grown and retrenched during that time period, I’ve been wondering about the geographic diversity of these seed dollars. Throughout these cycles, are startups in other states benefitting? Are they increasing their share of investment dollars? The chart above shows the share of seed investment dollars by state over the last 7 years. California remains the leader with about 40-50% of dollars over time. New York oscillates between 10% and 20%. Illinois has seen some growth, like Texas. But on the whole, dollars haven’t changed geographies. Which states produce the largest seed rounds? Utah, New York, Massachussets, Indiana and California have the top 5 median seed rounds size. But we need to look deeper to understand the data. Which of these differences are statistically significant? All the states above have a p-value less than 0.05. This means there’s less than a 5% chance that median seed rounds in these states are larger than California. The data strongly suggests only Utah, Massachussetts and Washington DC have median seed rounds sizes equal to California. So, while seed dollars may not be flowing to startups in headquartered in different cities, a different trend is certainly happening: labor market arbitrage . The costs of hiring and retaining talent in the valley continue to increase. Consequently, founders are looking to build teams outside of California. This startup design pattern is common in Israeli companies, but has blossomed to include European businesses, Asian startups and is also happening within the US. Hiring sales teams or engineering teams in lower cost states has become easier and more common. I hope to publish data on that trend in the future.

It’s one of the most important questions a CEO can ask. Why does our sales team lose potential sales? One of the companies I work with, Chorus , listens and analyzes sales calls to provide insights to heads of sales and account executives. Chorus explored the reasons account executives lose sales opportunities . Set aside losses from competition. Of the remaining lost opportunities, 48% of prospects lacked budget. A further 38% demonstrated no urgency to buy. The remaining 13% of prospects didn’t have the buying authority. This is great news. These problems are simple to resolve. Each of these three objections should be a prospect qualification question. Your team may use MEDDIC, SPIN, or any of the other 6 sales methodologies . Each of them focuses on identifying the budget, the buyer and the urgency. The best run sales teams are disciplined qualifiers. They identify unlikely prospects early. The team will spend much less time on prospects that won’t convert. The funnel becomes more efficient and the team earns more. In The Checklist Manifesto , Atul 	Gawande explains the benefits of simple lists on human performance. There are two reasons we fail at work. Ignorance: not knowing. Ineptitude: failure to apply knowledge. Most of the time, we fail to do the things we say we should. Checklists solve that problem. What is needed, however, isn’t just that people working together be nice to each other. It is discipline. Discipline is hard–harder than trustworthiness and skill and perhaps even than selflessness. We are by nature flawed and inconstant creatures. We can’t even keep from snacking between meals. We are not built for discipline. We are built for novelty and excitement, not for careful attention to detail. Discipline is something we have to work at. MEDDIC is a checklist: Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Identify the pain, Champion. Learning MEDDIC or any framework is the first step. More important is the daily discipline of identifying the six criteria in each call. Engender that discipline to win more business.

Recently, I met an exceptional marketer. She described the purpose, strategy and tactics of a marketing department remarkably succinctly. Marketing’s methods can seem intangible. But she explained them simply and elegantly. I drew the chart above based on her vision of marketing’s roadmap. At the highest level, marketing articulates a compelling narrative. This is step 1.The narrative brings the market forward by contrasting the current state of affairs with a persuasive view of the future. This is a Gap Analysis - a comparison of the current state of affairs to the desired potential. By buying this product, your future will be better. In software, this typically means the buyer will be promoted . Marketing equips the internal champion to understand a change in the market and articulates the compelling reasons to act - to buy the software. The benefit to the business is important and real, resulting in a promotion. 1 The narrative may have several parts, and it will evolve as the market changes. Salesforce started marketing No Software and Sales Force Automation; a vision of the future without CDs to install or update software, which maintained up-to-date sales pipelines. Today that narrative is much broader and spans future views of marketing, support, data analytics and other spaces. Once the team establishes the narrative, persona creation is next. There are several key people in a sales process . Identifying the top three or four is critical. Next the narrative is mapped to the personas. Identify the pain points associated with the status quo impacting each persona. Then create marketing content to educate each of these personas about the benefits of the future, through the key parts of the customer journey. I’ve depicted four steps, but these depend on each startup’s buyer. Last, syndicate these messages through multiple channels to maximize reach. Search, social, speaking events, books, webinars, analysts, field marketing and others. Ultimately, these efforts should result in leads and accelerated sales cycles because the buyers understand and resonate with the future vision. Lead generation velocity and sales cycle metrics should be used to determine the effectiveness of the narrative, persona identification and lifecycle marketing efforts. In my experience, this marketing framework is unique in its simplicity and combination of strategy and tactics. 1. If a product doesn’t have that potential, the startup isn’t focused on an important problem. Sales cycles will drag. Price points will languish. Growth will be challenged.

At Saastr, Jason and I discussed the role of private equity in SaaS on stage as a potential acquisition path for SaaS startups. Private equity hasn’t been a common exit route for venture backed startups in the past. But that’s changing. The chart above depicts the total disclosed value of US venture-backed SaaS startups which have been acquired by PE firms since 2010. The aggregate value has grown from zero to about $13B over that time period. That’s roughly equal to the $14B spent by corporate strategics in the same market. Said another way, PE firms are spending as much buying SaaS startups as corporate acquirers. What’s changed? There’s a surfeit of capital in private equity. The excess increases prices and valuation multiples for acquisition targets. The result? PE firms pay the same or greater multiples than corporate acquirers , which hasn’t been the case in the past. Deal sizes have increased as well. The median venture-backed SaaS acquisition by PE has increased to $250M, up from $50M in 2010. The average deal size was $470M in 2017. Second, SaaS companies are aging. As they ripen, these companies have established themselves in a market, developed the predictable revenue and growth patterns (and potentially positive net income) sought by private equity firms. They generate stable annuities that can be levered with debt, and then managed to reduce costs - which is an ideal target for the standard LBO playbook. In addition, competition in the PE market is pushing private equity buyers earlier, as the chart above shows. Private equity will remain a potential exit option for SaaS startups who fit the mold. Predictable revenue streams, potential for cost cutting, and able to be levered. As the data above shows, about PE has rapidly become a substantial player in SaaS consolidation, and should remain so for a long time.

Founded in 2007, Dropbox epitomizes the freemium go-to-market. Dropbox has grown from 0 to 500 million users over that time period. 2% of those users convert to paid and pay an average of $9.33 per month.  90% of revenue originates through self serve channels -  an astounding figure for company that generated more than $1B in revenue last year. ![image]( " width=“500px”/> Dropbox’s revenue grew from $604M to $1.1B from 2015 to 2017, a compound annual growth rate of 35%. More impressive still:  the company has managed to nearly double revenues while decreasing the amount they spent on COGs annually. COGs stands for cost of goods sold. Images of Dropbox, which stores billions of files, hard disks and storage are the principal component of COGs. This decrease is driven by user policy changes that affect users who have been inactive for a year or more, and a shift to operating their own data centers instead of using cloud providers. Gross margin has meaningfully improved over that time frame due to these efficiency gains. GM doubled over the same time frame, from 33% to 67%. Despite the enormous infrastructure overhead, Dropbox’s gross margin is rapidly approaching the public SaaS median of 71%. Net income margin has also approached public medians, now at -10%. Most SaaS companies operate their businesses in this range. The benefits of freemium at scale appear in the free cash flow from operations metrics. In 2017, Dropbox generated more than $300M in free cash flow from ops, and for the past two years has sustained 30% cash flow from ops margins. This cash flow results directly from the sales efficiency of the business. At an estimated sales efficiency of 1.1, Dropbox’s is among the highest of all publics among others stars like Shopify . Unlike other SaaS companies, Dropbox spends more of its revenue on engineering than sales and marketing. Typically, businesses spend twice as much on S&M. Field Box Dropbox Revenue 399 1,107 Revenue Growth 32% 31% Gross Margin 72% 67% Net Income Margin -38.1 -0.1 Free Cash from Ops, $M -1 330 Free Cash from Ops Margin 0% 30% Est Sales Efficiency 0.4 1.1 MC/2017 Rev Multiple 7.97 7.97 Market Cap 3,175 8,816 The comparison to Box, a competitor from the earliest days in YCombinator, is inevitable. The table summarizes some key metrics. Dropbox generates more than twice as much revenue, but grows at the same rate. The businesses have roughly comparable gross margins. But Dropbox’s net income and free cash flow from operations margins are substantially higher, because of the self-serve customer acquisition dynamics. Dropbox generates about 2x more in gross profit per dollar in sales and marketing spend than Box. Assuming the market values Dropbox similarly to Box, the implied market cap for Dropbox is roughly $9B. However, Dropbox should benefit from a better multiple given its cash and sales efficiency. Dropbox is an impressively efficient business that epitomizes the strategic advantages of the freemium go-to-market strategy. Disclosure:  I work for Redpoint Ventures which holds shares of Dropbox.

What should be the return on investment of a startup’s cash burn? Fred Wilson posed this question last year in his post Some Thoughts on Burn Rates .  In that post, he suggests, and I agree, that a 5x ROI on cash burn is a good target. How does one calculate ROI? It’s a simple formula: Cash_Burn_ROI = Revenue_Multiple/Revenue_Pay_Back_in_Years 1 If a business is worth 7x revenues and revenue payback is 14 months, the burn ROI is 6x or 7 / 1.2. If a business is worth 5x revenues and revenue payback is 18 months, the ROI is 3x. Note, I’m using revenue payback, not gross margin payback here. This math reaffirms the importance of unit economics. Startups have no influence over their multiple. 2 So the best place to focus is payback period. This equation does highlight an important phenomenon. When the market pays high multiples for businesses, startups can maintain equivalent ROI with far longer payback periods. For example, at a 10x multiple, a startup can sustain 2 year paybacks at 5x ROI. We are currently in this market environment today. Such an environment entices startups to burn large amounts of cash. At a 10x multiple,  each marginal revenue dollar increases valuation by $10. So spending more makes sense for two reasons. SaaS customers are annuities . Buying more of them early leads to faster growth rates. Second, there are strategic advantages to growing faster including hiring, fundraising, and partnering. That doesn’t mean a business should spend cash without an eye or two on the balance sheet. In 2016, SaaS multiples fell 57% from their highs . Overnight, ROI math changes. But the cost structure of companies doesn’t change that quickly.  If there is a market correction,  and the company is not yet profitable, reorienting the business to sustain the same cash burn ROI is a prudent strategy. Remaining disciplined about unit economics and cost structure is critical to weathering the ups and downs of the market. It’s the single most important control lever a business has. 1 I get this formula in the following way. The inverse of revenue payback period is an approximation for the revenue generated from one year’s sales. Then I multiply that by the enterprise value to revenue multiple to get the ROI. 2 This is a bit of an overstatement. Gross margin, net income, aggregate cash burn, and growth rate all influence relative multiples. But if the market corrects, startups can’t do much about that.

You’re two or three years into your startup. You have hired a great team and want to retain them. It’s time to consider refreshing their stock options to motivate them to stay longer. How many options should you grant to each employee? Startups should pay key people market rate to retain them.
Otherwise, they may leave the business, lured by the promise of greater compensation elsewhere.
Let’s walk through an example. Assume Anna is a key employee at a startup RedCircle which wants to keep her.
Anna received a grant of 100,000 options on her start date. These options have a standard vesting schedule: a four-year vest with a one year cliff. This means the first 25,000 options vest after Anna has remained with the company for one year. Thereafter, the remaining 75,000 options vest monthly: 2083 options per month. The table below shows her annual vesting schedule through the first six years. Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 RedCircle Grant 25,000 25,000 25,000 25,000 0 0 At the beginning of year 3, half of Anna’s stock options has vested.
If she were to leave and find exactly the same role at a younger competitor, BlueSquare, she would receive 100,000 options in the second company.
(Note: I assume the stock options in both cases are of equivalent value.) 1 At her current company, she has 50,000 options yet to be vested. If Anna acted as a pure capitalist and considered only share count, she should leave her current startup.
She stands to gain more by taking the second startup’s offer: 150k options vs 100k options. Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 RedCircle Grant 25,000 25,000 0 0 0 0 BlueSquare Offer 0 0 25,000 25,000 25,000 25,000 Here we have to introduce an important wrinkle.
Over the past two years, RedCircle has increased in value.
It has grown and raised capital at a higher valuation.
So 75,000 RedCircle options are equal in value to 100,000 BlueSquare options. 2 What grant size should RedCircle issue to Anna at Year 3 to provide her a market-value grant? From Year 3 to Year 6, Anna should vest 75,000 RedCircle options to equal the BlueSquare offer. From her first grant, Anna has 50,000 vesting in years 3 and 4. To present a market offer, RedCircle should grant Anna an additional 25,000 options, which vest over 4 years. This is 6,250 options per year. With this grant, Anna will have 75,000 options vesting over the next four years. Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 RedCircle 1st Grant 25,000 25,000 25,000 25,000 0 0 RedCircle 2nd Grant 0 0 6,250 6,250 6,250 6,250 Early in its life, RedCircle should create a refresh grant policy for members of the team. The refresh policy above is one mechanism to do this. By granting more options at the end of the second year equal to or greater than market comparables, the startup will ensure its compensation packages are competitive. There are alternatives to this approach. Notably, former VC and current Wealthfront CEO Andy Rachleff advocates annual refresh grants equal to 25% of the market grant, vesting over 4 years. I’ve run the math and the difference between the two policies is less than 5% in the scenarios I tested. The most important thing is to create a refresh grant/retention grant policy early in a company’s life. The next most important thing is to be able to articulate to employees the rationale of the grant sizes. With either rubric, the message is the same: the employee is doing a terrific job and the startup would like to mark their compensation to market periodically. And the outcome is higher retention and greater employee satisfaction. Thanks to my partner Alex Bard for inspiring this post. [1] Option math is complicated. It involves predicting the value of a business into the future and considering the strike price of the option grant. Economists have been awarded Nobel Prizes for work on the topic. I’ve greatly simplified this example by considering share count only. [2] Again I’m simplifying. It’s nearly impossible to compare the value of options in two very early stage companies. But as companies grow, scale and raise capital, the value of a share in that company increases, because the risk of the option decreases. Factors like strike prices and taxes are other important considerations.

How should you think about designing your startup’s logo? The mark symbolizes your business. It’s destined to be ubiquitous.
Business cards, ads, hoodies, mobile apps, water bottles, even custom sneakers may bear the logo. In the most recent episode of 99% Invisible, Tom Geismar relates the creation story of the Chase logo. The Chase logo was one of the first abstract corporate marks, one without text. Since then, Geismar has created many iconic marks including Xerox, PBS, Mobil. Geismar offers three basic criteria for evaluating a logo: Appropriate - must fit your startup’s culture and its ecosystem Distinctive - must be unique enough to be distinguished from the competition Flexible - must be easily scaled to smaller sizes and different media In the interview, Geismar shares a few other important points. Not every business should use an abstract mark. The blue striated octagon works because of Chase’s reach. Chase, now called JPMorgan Chase & Co., advertises daily. Thousands of branches dot the map in the US and abroad.  Persistent exposure to the mark cements the brand association of the blue octagon in the minds of passersby. Businesses without the ambition or intention to scale brand spend should stick to logos with words. The same is true businesses who rely on correct spelling of difficult words to do business. Google’s name is a bastardized mathematician’s term for 10 with one hundred zeros . By choosing a colorful text logo, Google cemented their spelling of the concept as the dominant one.  Billions now type google without a second thought for spelling or the etymology. As for picking amongst a collection of alternatives, Geismar says, “It’s never love at first sight.” You must imagine the mark on sweatshirts and favicons and mobile phones and newspapers. Will it work there? Where won’t it work? And in today’s design centric environment, the mark will inevitably suffer critique.  The best way to change your mark is just to do it. ![image]( https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/nick-logo.png" height=12px>

Much of the conversation today about crypto is about Bitcoin and currency.
But that’s myopic. Soon, we will be talking about how crypto will change the software world. In fact, many founders have already started that pursuit. More than 30% of the initial coin offerings (ICO) in 2017 target developers and businesspeople with their products. The numbers are still small. B2B crypto companies raised about $400M of ICO dollars in 2017. B2D companies commanded $1.2B. This distribution reflects the early stage of the ecosystem. The blockchain is a technical advance. Consequently, it should initially appeal to developers more than their business counterparts. The data reflects this. Enterprise software has three layers: infrastructure, platform and application. Today, much of the effort is focused on infrastructure and platforms. Within the 200 ICOs I analyzed, there are tens of next-generation infrastructure players and a twenty or more platforms-as-a-service. Over time, the blockchain’s distributed database will find important applications in business, and funding will follow. Blockchain startups have already targeted major buyers of software, from email security products to job marketplaces, from legal products to human resources software. Where will decentralized software applications thrive? Wherever there is a need for a shared trusted database. The SaaS wave of the last ten years optimized intra-company operations. Workflows for sales, marketing, product and finance. In contrast, blockchain startups are exploring inter-company applications,  processes that involve two or more companies. Some startups enable data sharing across enterprises, permitting a partner to analyze data homomorphically. Others enable email white and blacklists to be shared securely, creating a coalition against phishing. Imagine the next Ariba as a decentralized database of inter-company invoices and purchase orders. Blockchain companies are striving to identify where this novel technology will dislocate incumbents, dislodge budgets and create massive businesses.  While today’s focus may be consumer applications, the SaaS world will undergo a similar and fundamental transformation.

20 years ago, a newly minted billionaire worked in his office. Fluorescent lights, a dingy purple carpet, and a CRT monitor resting on a door. Not a desk - those were too expensive - a door supported by 4x4s, brackets and wood screws. In his 60 Minutes profile , he drives around in a Honda Civic. His rationale? “It’s a perfectly good car.” The founder of course is Jeff Bezos. The photograph and the interview highlight an attribute I greatly admire in Bezos: clarity of purpose. From the very first shareholder letter , Customer Obsession is the first priority. This simple focus requires doing three simple, but hard things. First, a founder must decide to manage a company with a particular principle. The founder must choose it, stick with it, and reiterate it over months, years and decades. Second, the founder must operate the business with that principle. The founder must infuse management meetings, guide decisions, hire a team and recommit every day to that idea. Third, the founder must exemplify the values himself or herself, and lead by example. Those three things are simple, but hard. To think through the right way to run a business - in a way that aligns the strengths of the team, the go-to-market strategy and the long term competitive advantage - takes effort. And then to lead a company that way requires relentless focus and determination. When I saw that photo of Bezos in his office, it reminded me of the dogged focus on a single idea. The desk, the Civic, the spray-painted amazon.com sign. Everything in that photo embodies that obsession. His purpose is clear.

When a startup takes form, the first weeks and months and years are spent furiously. The team assembles itself. The lightbulb illuminates. It is formed and reformed again and again as customers supply feedback. Eventually the team hews the right product. The startup raises capital. Then the team returns focus to hiring, evolving the product, and closing customers. However, continuing this way isn’t the path to huge scale. There’s a critical step missing. In the early days, the founders plan each week as it comes. Customer meetings, product releases, investor pitches. Three yards and a cloud of dust. Get up. Fight for another three yards. Every damn day. Suddenly, the business is working. The founders have hired department heads, who manage employees. At some point, those managers manage managers too. There’s enough breathing room to go on vacation. When the founders return, the company has carried on in their absence. Liftoff. What a feeling. Plowing into the tactical day-to-day is instinct, but it’s a mistake. It’s time to look ahead. Three months ahead at first. Then six months, then twelve months. Then two years. What will the business need in six months? A new VP of customer success. New features to move upmarket. Relationships with research firms. New office space. A larger balance sheet. A key partnership. And in twelve months? To have built a brand. To recruit 100 people. To have raised capital. To have developed a longer term product roadmap. To understand the competitive dynamics in the market. To answer these questions, the team must look beyond this today’s one-on-ones and this month’s engineering milestones this quarter’s sales pipeline. They must expand their time horizon. They must anticipate what the business will need a few quarters out. Then they must plan to achieve those objectives. And start working on them today. As the business increases it scale, the management team needs to plan further and further out in time. Broader ambitions require longer term planning. And then it’s back to the cotidian grind. Hitting this week’s growth. Decreasing customer service response times. Open water swimmers pick a point to guide them as they swim. Then they immerse themselves in the water for a 20 or 30 yards. When they pick their head up again, they correct a bit and then plunge back into the task at hand. They seesaw between long term planning and short term execution. It’s the same with a startup.

This is one of the best pieces of advice I’ve collected about writing. Put each sentence on a separate line when you write. When we read, we hear a rhythm. There is a rhythm to the words. And when we read, we look to find that rhythm, which pushes us through  the end of a sentence, so if I write a really long sentence, and the reader isn’t expecting it – like this one –  the reader will find it really hard to follow and understand where I am going. And if I keep writing really long sentences, I’m going to exhaust the reader, because there’s no place to stop and take a breath and think about what it is that I have written. Whew! If I write a short sentence, you can breathe. But. Short staccato sentences. Aren’t. Good either. Separate lines help you see your reader’s journey. Make that journey interesting. Vary the length of your sentences. By putting each sentence on a line, repetition in structure or words will jump out at you. Verlyn Klinkenborg is a former member of the editorial board of the New York Times.
He wrote a book called Several Short Sentences about Writing . The entire book is written with one sentence per line. And the effect is remarkable. You can hear his voice and see the effect of clear writing. Give it a try the next time you write. It’s transformational. And the next time you feel nervous about writing, remember this: Being a writer is an active perpetual self authorization. No matter who you are. Only you can authorize yourself. You do that by writing well, by constant discovery. Verlyn Klinkenborg

Recently, I wrote about customer/revenue operations , an idea that seems to be taking hold at many different SaaS companies. Instead of optimizing the performance of each individual step of the customer lifecycle, customer operations optimizes it over the entire journey. This is a fundamental change in the way a business manages its customers, and it’s now starting to be reflected in the organizational structure of SaaS startups Two advances in thinking have led to the idea of customer operations. First, customer journeys are not linear. The classic funnel that we all picture in our minds isn’t the way that customers buy anymore. A customer may register for a SaaS product’s free trial, try it, contact customer support and decide not to buy at the expiration of the trial. But they return 90 days later and sign a contract for $90,000. Or a buyer might attend a few events hosted by a vendor, receive marketing emails over the course of 18 months, and then finally convert with an inbound call. Neither of these customer journeys is exactly the “prospect to qualified lead to contract” journey that has been canonicalized in Predictable Revenue. Second, this nonlinearity means the responsibility for a customer bounces from internal team to internal team. Marketing might engage a customer initially, passing the lead to sales development. Customer success might get involved at the beginning of a process to answer some key questions. When the customer goes dark, the lead reverts to marketing. And when they finally come in to sign a contract in sales is involved. Measuring the success of the marketing team’s ability to convert an initial customer to a sales qualified lead may not be the optimal way of building a business. Instead, it’s better to measure the end-to-end conversion rate from first touch to ultimate close. Cross functional objectives like this can be achieved by building cross functional organizations and managing them well. But to simplify things, some SaaS companies are choosing to reorganize. They place sales development, account executives, and customer success/post sales support under the same leader, most of the time a CRO. The idea is that this leader will optimize the funnel from end to end, because the broader team will have a single objective of maximizing revenue. With a singular leader, these teams will have the executive support to experiment more aggressively with end to end funnel optimization, trying techniques that reflect the nonlinearity of their customers’ journey. From initial outreach to engagement, from contract close to successful expansion, a SaaS startup is in the business of maximizing that customer lifetime value. Changing your startup’s organizational structure to reflect how your business manages its customers through their journey might be something to consider.

In SaaS, machine learning has become an essential component to many different products. Whether it’s automating responses to inbound sales queries, identifying expense reports for audit, or surfacing anomalies in data, machine learning improves workflow software. To date, most software imbued with machine learning reduces costs rather than increase revenues. Why is this the case? Because machine learning is focused on efficiency gains. First, to train a machine learning model requires large amounts of data. Repetitive workflow processes produce this data. With enough data, a machine learning model can be applied to automate the workflow. For example, it’s straightforward to build machine learning models to automatically answer password reset questions. Second, automation reduce costs because they eliminate the need to hire additional people to handle more work. A bot replies to login reset questions with an automated response in a link to a knowledge base, freeing customer support reps to focus on more challenging questions. Third, revenue-generating activities are often unpredictable and novel. A new marketing campaign that positions a business intelligence product in a novel way can deliver a 30% increase in inbound lead volume. We haven’t found a way, yet, to have computers do those things for us. Perhaps that will change in the future. Generative machine learning - the software that composes music or writes code -  could “imagine” a constellation of new marketing campaigns or sales pitches.  Coupling machine generated ideas with the efficient automated testing systems we’re developing today might unlock revenue growth opportunities. By and large, the most frequent applications of machine learning in SaaS today are efficiency applications - automating the high-volume rote processes and reducing costs. Consequently, if you looking to build a machine learning based SaaS company, find a really expensive internal process and automate it. Helping workers do more with less is always a compelling value proposition, provided the savings are large enough.

“My goal is to make you love rowing.” That’s how my first rowing started. I had never picked up an oar or stepped into a racing shell before. With 100 other freshman men, I had assembled at the boathouse along the maple and conifer lined Connecticut River. I’ll never forget those words. I had played many sports before. In every other case, the focus, the mission, the motivation had always been to win. This was different. Over the next four years, I came to understand why our coach had started the freshman season this way. Rowing is a brutal and arduous sport. After the 3, 2, 1 count, two eight men teams and one coxswain - who steers the boat and motivates the crew - place their oars in the water and pull with all their might. As the boat leaves the starting point and lurches into the water, nearly two tons of muscle, sinew and bone moves back and forth, pulling a stroke in less than a second, in a 36 inch wide carbon fiber shell. This has to be done in synchrony, while maintaining the balance of a millimeter-thin racing shell. The winner is the team which works together best, employs the most accurate technique and is willing to suffer more pain. We trained indoors and outdoors for six months of the year to compete in 8 races of 6 minutes each. 180 days of training in the rain, the snow, the freezing temperatures of New Hampshire, for 48 minutes in total. To be willing to continue rowing each year, you had to love the sport. Really love it. Breathe it. That’s what our coach, a former Olympian in 1984, knew from his experience and what he instilled in us: If you wish to build a ship, do not divide the men into teams and send them to the forest to cut wood. Instead, teach them to long for the vast and endless sea. This quotation captures that espirit de corps better than anything else I’ve read. It’s attributed to Antoine de St. Exupery , the author of The Little Prince, and some of the best adventure books ever written including Sand, Wind and Stars. He had it right. To evoke exceptional performance from a team, a leader must first inspire love of the dream.

Last week, I shared a presentation with an executive team at a large public SaaS company on everything I’ve learned about pricing. Here’s a summary of the frameworks and theory that I’ve aggregated over a decade of investing in startups. Why do we set prices? Setting aside the important reasons of generating revenue and maintaining solvency for a business, there are many other reasons to set price. Price reinforces brand because price telegraphs whether a product is a premium product or a value product. Price differentiates products in the market and can be used as a go-to-market strategy. Underprice the competition to gain share. There are many others too . There are four components to pricing: Strategy: what is the goal of the price? Philosophy: how does the company price relative to costs? Structure: what is the pricing rubric? Positioning: how best to communicate the price? Strategy There are only 3 pricing strategies : Skimming, Maximization, and Penetration. Skimming means charging the first to buy a product more than the later buyers. Maximization is charging the most you can extract in each sale. Penetration is under-pricing to gain share. Philosophy There are two pricing philosophies: cost-based pricing and value-based pricing. Cost-based pricing is common in commodity markets. To price based on cost, you take the cost of the product and then add a margin. If you’re targeting 50% margins, just double your cost and there you are. Value based pricing means charging the customer what they are willing to pay. This requires understanding their budget and the value of the product to them. Structure In software, we typically see three pricing structures . Linear Pricing (LP) - Each analytics event costs $0.10. 2 Part Tariff (2PT) - The analytics software has a base platform fee of $10,000 and each analytics event processed by the system costs $0.10 more. 3 Part Tariff (3PT) - Again, the software has a base platform fee but the fee is $25,000 because it includes the first 150k events are free. Each marginal event costs $0.15. In academic research and theory, the 3 part tariff is proven to be best. It provides many different ways for the sales team to negotiate on price and captures the most value. Position There are three ways to position pricing: per unit of consumption (message, analytics event, telephony minute), per person and ELA (enterprise license agreement), which is a prenegotiated deal for everyone in a business. To figure out the right pricing strategy, it’s critical to determine what the buyer cares about. Do they care about cost or value? What is their core unit of their world: people, dollars, gigabytes? How predictable is the pricing plan? And can the buyer clearly articulate the pricing, advocate on your behalf and champion the purchase? It’s also important to understand the seller’s needs. How does the pricing change the market size? The unit economics and cash flows associated with the sale? The competitive positioning? All of these disciplines fall under product marketing. Well run product marketing teams develop these perspectives before product launch. By combining market research, interviews with prospective customers, conversations with the sales team, the product marketing team can develop a unified pricing strategy that is consistent with the company strategy and the sales tactics. The challenge with pricing is that it’s never a constant. As an industry evolves, competitive pressures change, a vendor’s positioning changes and the buyer’s needs change, so must pricing. Thinking through these 4 core parts of pricing is critical to ensuring internal alignment and maximizing success of developing the right pricing plan for your business.

In December 2017, the amount raised in ICOs nearly equaled the amount raised by Series A investments globally. The technology innovation catalyzed by Bitcoin and Blockchain is creating many multibillion dollar economies quickly. The ICO market today bears many similarities to the dotcom era. Startups can raise hundreds of millions of dollars on an idea. Twenty years ago, the idea had to be sketched on a napkin. Today, the protocol must be detailed in a white paper. But the ability to access huge amounts of capital at a similarly nascent stage is identical. Like the dotcom era, most of the companies raising huge sums in ICOs will not endure. But they are a critical part of the evolution and maturation of the market and the technology, because these businesses will further the ecosystem to finding valuable applications of distributed ledgers and databases. In the early 2000s, the billions of dollars invested enabled the Internet. They financed the development and deployment of switches, routers, modems and the installation of copper lines to connect new data centers. Without that capital backing, the rollout would have taken much longer. Typically, large capital expenditure (capex) investments aren’t attractive startups for venture capitalists to back because the returns on equity aren’t very good. Look no further than the cleantech wave in the mid-aughts to prove the point. But in environments like the current one and with the innovation of an ICO, bold, high-capex bets are possible again. About a third of the ICOs in 2017 raised some form of institutional capital before ICO. Presumably, they used these funds to pay employees before the ICO. The median ICO raised $15M, but the top few raised $100M or more each. ICOs create are a form of non-dilutive financing that incentivizes the network to participate. Imagine a theoretical internet service provider that uses quantum entanglement to send packets around the world at 10 gig speeds. With a small venture round, a big ICO, and the distribution of tokens to the ISP customers, such a business could conceivably be financed today (ignoring the scientific questions of productionizing entanglement). In addition to the ICO market, the venture and private equity markets are flush with capital. We’re in an era that has the cash, the willingness and the protocols to finance fundamental and massive change in a way that we haven’t seen in a generation.

Below are 7 predictions about the startup software ecosystem. How many of them do you agree with? The tax holiday for repatriation creates one of the most active M&A environments of the past ten years. The repatriation holiday is part of the new tax plan. It permit companies to bring US dollars held abroad (from software sales in other countries) back to the US at a lower tax rate than before. The scale is enormous. Apple could repatriate $252B, Cisco $65B, Google $55B. That cash could be used for dividends, share buy backs and acquisitions. Several landscape altering SaaS acquisitions will come to fruition because of cash availability from repatriation and because there are enough public SaaS companies at scale to add material revenue and market cap to buyers. Some ideas: Google buys Salesforce. Microsoft buys Workday. Oracle buys ServiceNow. There are now 5 publicly traded software companies worth more than $10B, and 19 companies worth between $2.5B and $10B. The SaaS fundraising market remains ebullient through 2018 as vibrant M&A and an open IPO window trigger substantial liquidity for shareholders. Machine learning fades as a buzzword. A while ago, I pulled up the Redpoint website from a decade ago, when the bios of the partners said things like “I invest in the internet.” Or five years ago, “I invest in mobile.” Just as those trends have become ubiquitous to be implicit, so will machine learning. Blockchain in the enterprise takes the reign as the buzzword for 2018. Founders will look to apply the innovation of a distributed and decentralized-trust database in different parts of the ecosystem. In particular, blockchain applications will pop-up in inter-company applications or where network effects are important (payments, security, supply chain). The classic open source strategy of the last fifteen years is abandoned because of the competitive threats from infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS vendors). New licenses may emerge to create some barrier to entry or open source vendors keep proprietary a greater fraction of the code base. GDPR becomes an important consideration in most SaaS companies product and sales teams as the European regulation changes lead generation practices and data retention/governance practices in Europe. Similar regulations will be adopted in other regions. The industry pendulum switches from fragmentation to consolidation in products as well as companies. Businesses emerge that create opinionated stacks for different functional roles and simplify day-to-day tasks for knowledge workers. I like writing these lists because they  are very likely to be proven wrong in the fullness of time and looking back at them a few years later gives you a sense of what the world felt like back then. Have a great new year, everyone!

There’s a crisis in the scientific academic world. It’s called the Replication Crisis .  Scientists have found that they cannot replicate the results published by many scientific studies. The same thing is happening in the world of business. Over the last 15 years I’ve read several hundred business books, and I’ve written one. Across those 15 years, one of the most interesting is a book called The Management Myth, which traces the history of management science back to its less than solid origins. The book illuminates the history of scientific management and Taylorism , and supplies evidence that much the original data underpinning these theories was fabricated. I was curious if this was a broader trend, and it may be. I found other cases. More recent examples include Scientific American debunking the theory behind Jim Collin’s work, Good to Great . A team of academics failed to reproduce Kahneman’s work on social priming theory . In 2014, Jill Lepore wrote a polemic arguing Clayton Christensen’s disruption theory wasn’t supported by the examples in his book. Over the holiday break, I read another 10 business books. One revealed how to interpret body language in others. Another applied sports principles to the business world. A third ported military theory to the business world. Each tries to simplify the world, reduce its complexity, in effort to offer some form of reproducible insight. If you do this, you will find great success. The three books listed in the paragraph above suffer from survivorship bias, picking winners and using them as the data set to extrapolate a theory of success. In the machine learning world, this is known as overfitting -  drawing a conclusion without all the data required. In other words, drawing conclusions from anecdotes or small sample sizes. As I study and meet and analyze more and more businesses, I find myself drawn to the idea that each is a snowflake. Each startup is unique composition of its team, in the circumstances of its genesis, and the ecosystem in which it blossoms.  Business concepts like the ones mentioned above can provide a common language about ideas. They can help us tell stories to motivate and inspire. Perhaps, they can provide some form of analytical framework. But until the success of these theories can stand the test of reproducibility or time,  that’s all they should be. After all, even some of the most successful CEOs in the world cannot reproduce their success the second time or third time. Building a business is really hard, and building an enduring company even more so, because each enduring business is built in a different way. Each January, I remind myself of this idea. To start the year with a fresh mind, that the world is different, meaningfully different than it was last year, and that means jettisoning the assumptions of the past - until the assumption can be reproduced consistently.

When negotiating your next fundraising round, should you talk valuation in premoney terms or postmoney terms? Premoney is the valuation before the investment, employee stock option pool (ESOP) expansion, debt-to-equity conversion and investment. Postmoney is the value of the business after all that. As an investor, postmoney is simpler. Despite the improved simplicity, I don’t think the industry is going to move to postmoney anytime soon. Why are postmoney conversations simpler? Because the valuation of the business is fixed. The value of the business doesn’t float from variables like pro-rata participation, ESOP expansion and debt-to-equity conversion. Existing investors, also called insiders, often have negotiated for pro-rata rights. Pro-rata is the right but not obligation to invest in future rounds to maintain the same ownership. Lots of pro-rata rights means a larger round size. ESOP expansion also increases pro-rata investment. With the rise of debt as a seed investment vehicle, debt-to-equity conversions at the time of equity rounds are more common. The face value of the debt is added to the postmoney at investment time. By starting a negotiation with post-money, a founder and investor can settle on a valuation range before getting into the nitty-gritty of cap table math. That simplicity appeals to the engineer in me. But I don’t expect postmoney conversations to increase in frequency for one simple reason: anchoring . Anchoring is a negotiating technique. By anchoring a premoney and letting the postmoney float, the founder(s) likely negotiate better prices. For example, if I’m negotiate a $5M Series A at $15M premoney or $20M postmoney, which sounds more appealing as an investor to take back to the partnership? The lower number - even if the  the end result is the same. Premoney is all about minimizing sticker shock, just like at a car dealer. The taxes, titling, destination fee (aka pro-rata, debt conversion and ESOP) are all tacked on at the end, after the buyer is thrilled to be in a new car, or partnered with a new startup. When negotiating your next round, talk premoney.

A friend suggested that I read the Five Dysfunctions of a Team over the weekend. Though I’m passionate about business books, I rolled my eyes. I had seen this one on best seller lists for a long time, and never thought it would have much to offer. I admit my book-cover bias was wrong. The author has a counterintuitive assertion. Meetings shouldn’t be boring. The book is a fable, describing the journey of a new CEO, Kathryn, who takes the helm of a struggling high-growth startup. She brings her management team on a series of off-sites. During one of those conversations, she says: Let me assure you that from now on, every staff meeting we have will be loaded with conflict. And they won’t be boring. And if there is nothing worth debating, then we won’t have a meeting. I’ve been in about 15 years worth of meetings and I tried to think through the reasons why a meeting is boring. I’ve run many boring meetings, too. I came up with five : Meeting basics -  The meeting isn’t run well. No one has prepared an agenda, set a goal, picked the right length of time or prepared for the meeting. These meetings wander and are boring because no one knows what to do. Meeting topics - the meeting has nothing controversial or novel. Typically, these are status update meetings, training meetings, etc. Staffing problem - the key people aren’t invited to the meeting, so the right conversation can’t be had. Style problems - the meeting isn’t run well. The style is doesn’t encourage conversation or the speaker isn’t effective. Cultural problems -  the culture of the firm/team dissuades criticism, stifling conversation. The book focuses mostly on the fifth problem, and describes how the team develops a culture that encourages debate.  This is the most serious challenge. Everything else can be quickly corrected, but massaging a culture to encourage active debate by creating an environment of trust and respect is no easy feat. I agree with the assertion. I imagine if every meeting were filled with conflict and debate, each would be interesting in its own way. And, ideally, meetings are convened to solicit differing opinions, to drive to an ultimate best decision. The reality is a bit more varied. We use meetings for many different purposes. All hands meetings, status update meetings, one on ones. In many of those cases, conflict isn’t the purpose. Guiding someone’s career or informing a company about recent developments don’t necessarily have a lot of intrinsic conflict. But they should be interesting regardless. I went through a phase when I read lots of books about how to present well. One of the ideas that has stayed with me is the amount of time people invest in a meeting. If I call a meeting for seven people, that’s eight hours of collective time, which is expensive. If I present to 1000 people for 20 minutes, that’s 334 hours of human thought. That’s why preparation is so important. Ultimately, running an effective meeting boils down to respect for the time of others. I like the bold assertion that meetings shouldn’t be boring. If they are, there’s an issue.

“Evidence from science suggests that business people must be insane to use brainstorming groups.” That’s a shocking statement. Adrian Furnham, a professor of organizational and applied psychology at University College London, said it. It turns out it’s completely true. Participants in interactive brainstorming groups rated their performance quite favorably…[and] felt that interactive group brainstorming was more productive than individual brainstorming…However, actual performance data [showed] …interactive groups generated fewer distinct ideas. Social Influence processes in group brainstorming We feel better and more productive in group brainstorming sessions, but in reality, we produce fewer ideas and of fewer quality. In addition to the paper above, these results have been confirmed many times. The researchers and authors of the paper proposed the theory that three forces impinge group brainstorming productivity: Production blocking: in a group, each idea must be processed serially, one-by-one. When brainstorming alone, people process in parallel. This enables much faster iteration. Evaluation apprehension: the fear of public speaking or the fear of saying something unintelligent before one’s peers Free riding: with many people in the room, the tragedy of the commons set in and some attendees disengage. If group brainstorming is a key part of your workflow and you’d like to maintain it,  research has proven two remedies. First, online brainstorming works well. It enables participants to process in parallel and mitigates some of the free riding effects since contributions are recorded and easily compared among group members. Second, competition between brainstorming groups also mitigates some negative effects. The group brainstorming sessions who were told the performance figures of a previous group aimed and succeeded in generating as many high quality ideas as their predecessors. But the simplest and most effective way to generate ideas remains working individually and then convening a team to sift through ideas.

How quickly do the fastest growing software companies build their teams? The answer is incredibly quickly. In fact, this data bolsters the notion that management team’s top priority is recruiting, especially after the business has reached product market fit and capitalized itself well. Above, I’ve charted the headcount growth rate for 10 of the fastest growing software companies in recent history. I’ve normalized the years for when all the businesses were roughly at the same headcount - fewer than 50 people. This is a proxy for when the business established product market fit. There is quite a bit of variance in the growth rates of each of these companies. The fastest grower scales to more than 600 people in 30 months. Another business nearly surpasses 1000 employees and four years.on the other side of the coin, one of these businesses takes four years to reach about 200 employees. The business circumstances, environment, funding opportunity and many other dynamics contribute to hiring decisions. One interesting question that I would like to answer is how these hiring growth curves correlate to revenue/ARR curves. I would presume that they are very highly correlated. Another interesting analysis would be to break down hiring by function. Unfortunately, that data isn’t available. What does the “average” hyper growth software company look like in terms of headcount growth? They start around 25 people. A year later they are about 60. At year two, they reach more than 150, and double in year three. Average is a harsh word here and that all of these businesses are exceptional. And as I always say, there many different ways to build a business so this is not a prescription for success by any means. To be able to grow at this rate requires an  expertise in recruiting and the commitment to building out the people function. It also requires developing a layer of management in between the executive team and the rest of the employees incredibly quickly. That transition from managing individual contributors, to managing managers, to managing managers of managers of managers is not an easy one to make. For many of these companies, that transition comes awfully quickly, in 12 or 18 months. During this time period, an executive team learn to handle these challenges on the job as they develop. That’s why executive coaches and chief people officer/head of human resources are so critical in high-growth companies.

There’s a parallel between cryptoassets today and the British colonial period predating the US. In the late-1600s, colonies began to print their own money. Today, we’re seeing many startups coin their own money, creating an explosion in the number of new (crypto)currencies. States printed colonial money to pay debts to citizens. During tax collection times, the state accepted citizens’ bills as payment and retired the bills from circulation. Citizens would pay each other with these bills. They could also exchange them across state lines, but not at 1:1. Each state’s bills had a different exchange rate. Colonial money didn’t have a central policy body, a federal reserve equivalent. In addition, they were poorly managed. Many of the states issued too much paper money, causing inflation and eventual collapse in confidence of these currencies. In 1775, the US government issued $241M worth of Continentals, the currency of the Revolution, to finance the war. That currency collapsed too, because of a lack of a single monetary policy, counterfeiting by the British and other reasons. After Independence, the Founding Fathers backed the dollar with gold and silver to prevent a similar loss of confidence. Any citizen could walk into a bank with a dollar and walk out with an equivalent amount of gold.  About 200 years later, Richard Nixon ended dollar/gold convertibility . I think about this history when meeting cryptoasset businesses. Each startup is creating a new currency, like the colonies. They each have a white paper, drafted in the font of academic papers with LaTeX equations. These whitepapers are the policy documents of a mini-federal reserve bank of a their currency. The white paper outlines the monetary policy of the economy. How will currency be doled out? When will it be created? How will it be regulated? In the revolutionary era, Pennsylvania managed its currency well. Unlike many of its peers and unlike the Continental, the Pennsylvania pound held its value through the war. There’s a history of the Pennsylvania pound written in 1896 for those wishing to go deeper. Will the story of cryptocurrency trace the arc of colonial currency? Certainly. There will be startups who manage their ecosystems well and whose currencies will thrive and appreciate, and some less so. This is another example of history rhyming.

I’m grateful for all the entrepreneurs who have spent time teaching me how to build their companies. Over these past few days, I have been reading the book Antifragile written by Nassim Taleb.  In the book, he writes about many provocative things, but the one that sticks out with me this holiday is about innovation, and it harkens back to the original title of this blog that I started to write nearly 7 years ago: ex post facto. Taleb entertains with his irreverence and his depth of thought. He images a new academic institution catering to birds - the Harvard-Soviet Department of Ornithology. In this department, a collection of 60-year-old professors dressed in black robes, dictate to a group of birds on the principles of flight in a form of English that is full of jargon interlaced with equations. It’s laughable to think birds would learn to fly this way. But this is the way that we teach innovation. Reading history, we often reach the wrong conclusion that innovation like this: Academia → Applied Science and Technology → Practice Taleb argues innovation evolves this way: Random Tinkering (antifragile) → Heuristics (technology) → Practice and Apprenticeship Clay Christensen captured the idea when he said something along the lines of, “The next big thing will start out looking like a toy. ” These innovations, which start out looking like toys, ultimately create  broader theories, which are studied in academia and published, in a parallel loop: Practice → Academic Theories → Academic Theories → ... Taleb’s story of the Department of Ornithology reminded me of ex post facto, a Latin expression which means after-the-fact. When I first started writing this blog, I knew that I would never be able to predict the future, and that it would always be some kind of reportage on all the innovations that I was observing, created by the constellation of founders in Startupland. When I’m asked why I became a venture capitalist, my answer is always the same: because it’s a job that offers an unlimited learning curve. For the inspiration and the privilege to learn from exceptional founders and teams, I’m very grateful.

In the eleventh episode of Masters of Scale, Reid Hoffman interviews Peter Thiel . The episode revolves around the idea that to truly succeed, a startup must not beat the competition, but break free of competition entirely. The episode has many great points, but the one that stood out most to me is the idea of false competition. You could say that Coke and Pepsi compete very intensely, on the other hand you could say that there’s somehow quite differentiated from a brand so that in practice different people prefer Coke or prefer Pepsi and they’re actually is a much smaller set of people who view them as interchangeable products. And so, I think measuring how much actual competition is happening is not always a straightforward thing to do. transcript There is the classic perspective on the cola wars. Sweetened, colored, carbonated water is a commodity virtually indistinguishable aside from the brand adorning the can or bottle. Commodity implies competition. But for many cola drinkers, there is no choice. One is clearly superior. The nuances between Coke and Pepsi become critical differentiators and divide the competitive landscape into an oligopoly masquerading as a competitive market. There is far less competition than one might expect naively. Demand is not as elastic as economic theory might suggest because the subtleties (brand, bottle, taste) are the axes of competition, not cost. The same is true of coffee for caffeine cravers and gasoline brands for petrolheads. And software. For startups, this idea cuts both negatively and positively. The negative viewpoint: though a theoretically large market may exist for a particular type of software, the universe of potential switchers - customers who forsake Coke for Pepsi at a lower price - is substantially smaller than a bottoms-up or top-down market analysis might suggest. The positive viewpoint: there is an opportunity to enter an ostensibly congested market if the startup can determine which nuanced axes of competition are enough to entice customers to switch. For example, Stumptown cold-brew challenges Starbucks iced coffee. Casper mattresses tackles Sleep Train. Google Docs and Microsoft Word.  MongoDB vs MySQL. Both ideas lead to the same conclusion. You can create a sustainable competitive advantage for your startup by understanding the true axes of competition. And that requires researching the market or knowing it intimately, because these axes often change. The effort is well worth it. With that strategic knowledge, you will redefine how the market buys soda or coffee or mattresses or software. In which case, you’ll have eclipsed the competition and created a monopoly.

Disagree and commit. I first read about this idea in the 2016 Amazon Shareholders letter. But the idea can be traced back to Andy Grove at Intel. Grove wrote about this topic in High Output Management. Disagree and commit is a management technique for handling conflict. There are two parts to it. First, expecting and demanding teammates to voice their disgreement. Second, no matter their point of view, once a decision has been made, everyone commits to its success. Bezos described it this way: Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit.
“Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.” I’ve worked in environments in the past where management clearly communicated the obligation to dissent - and it’s wonderful. The obligation to dissent empowers people to speak their minds freely, leads to more engaged meetings, better discussion and ultimately improved ideas. This is the first half of disagree and commit. It’s Peter Drucker’s creation But only if the team commits to the idea’s success. The second part is equally as important to the first. Without the full team’s support and effort behind the idea, it won’t achieve its potential. Instead, apathy, confusion and infighting will torpedo the team’s execution. More broadly, and more importantly, morale suffers. Over the past ten years in venture, sometimes I’ve heard management teams describe particular members of their team as toxic to their culture. Toxic is a  broad but barbed word. It describes those who disagree and don’t commit. An employee’s lack of commitment spreads to others, depletes morale and saps the sense of teamwork and common mission to achieve a singular purpose. This works against the interests of the leadership and the company, confounding progress. Disagree and commit cannot be applied blindly. There are ethical boundaries, regulatory brightlines and values thresholds that can’t be crossed. But for most daily business decisions about strategy, product, marketing, engineering and other teams, disagree and commit is a powerful notion to capitalize upon a startup’s principal advantage in a market: execution speed.

Founders often describe their unit economics in terms of their LTV/CAC ratio - the ratio of the  Lifetime Value (LTV) of a customer to the Cost of Customer Acquisition (CAC). The LTV/CAC metric can be a powerful metric to unpack the health of the go-to-market team of a company, as Netsuite has shown . But this figure is often meaningless for early stage startups. Why? Because a company one or two or even three years into sales can’t yet accurately forecast customer lifetimes. If a business suffers from a very high churn rate, then, yes, it’s possible to calculate LTV in just a few years. But most software companies will see 10% or less unit churn per year. At 10% unit churn, three years from now, 73% of customers will still be paying, adding to their LTV. How long will those customers stay? You could project a straight line churn, a fixed churn rate per year, but that may not be realistic. How will those businesses’ spend change over time? You won’t know until you see it for yourself. Plus, you’ll have to decide which of the several ways to calculate LTV . Last, most early stage companies may not have enough samples to calculate LTV with statistical significance. Further complicating things, the LTV/CAC ratio is used as a metric of when to ramp sales and marketing spend. If the ratio is greater than 3x, then it’s time to spend more. The challenge with this strategy is it links today’s marketing spend to the projected, discounted future cash flows of a customer, which as we’ve seen above, are tricky to calculate. In the early stages, payback period is a better metric to use. Why? Because within 14-18 months, most startups will have collected concrete data about the payback periods for customer acquisition, instead of 3, 5 or 7 years for LTV observations. Because benchmarks exist for public and private payback periods - and the metric is more standardized because it doesn’t require long-dated assumptions -  an early stage startup can much more quickly evaluate it’s go-to-market strategy. Faster iteration cycles are a competitive advantage. Tying marketing spend to LTV is a challenging prospect for early stage startups because they are asked to project many years forward with little concrete data. Use payback period instead.

The startup acquisition market is off by roughly 35% year-over-year. Why the decline? One consistent response from potential acquirers is that they are waiting for tax reform to happen. If it does happen, and when acquirers do decide to pursue acquisitions, I suspect we will enter a very acquisitive environment for three reasons. First, the cash available to finance acquisitions on the balance sheets of public companies has grown by 20 X over the last 10 years and now totals more than $8.5 billion. Second, the market capitalizations of the public SaaS companies have increased by 28X over the same time period. This is even more staggering considering the multibillion-dollar acquisitions of the past few years. For example, LinkedIn at $26 billion, Netsuite at $9.3 billion and Concur at $8.3 billion. In addition, we seen a flurry of take private by private equity firms of Marketo, Cvent, Xactly,  and others. The market capitalizations of the remaining companies have grown enough to offset and surpass the contributions of those businesses that are now privately held. Third, the combination of these two trends, plus the availability of debt which is something most technology companies have not yet pursued, implies that there is an enormous amount of purchasing power latent in the market. If we conservatively assume that 10% of the market capitalization (stock) and 50% of the cash could theoretically be used for acquisitions, and ignore debt, the  aggregate purchasing power is roughly $29.5 billion - sufficient for 30 enterprise unicorns. In addition, this analysis ignores the purchasing power of the largest software companies. The likes of Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle, and SAP. Those companies would increase purchasing power by whole number multiples of the estimate above.

Initial Coin Offerings, a fundraising mechanism for companies using cryptocurrencies as a mechanism to buy their service, seem to be upending the world of venture capital. Filecoin raised $250M through an ICO. Tezos raised $232M.  Bancor raised $153M. These are massive amounts of money. Recently, I’ve been wondering how prevalent ICOs are and whether they could potentially be a substitute for venture capital. The chart above shows the number and size of ICOs since the beginning of this year. Though November 6, 130 ICOs have raised $2.7B. 18 have raised more than $100M, while 120 have raised up to $50M. That’s an enormous amount of money. And the trend is up and to the right. ICOs have raised more than $350M in each of the last five months. To put this momentum into context, let’s compare ICO activity to Series A activity globally. Unlike crowdfunding which has never exceeded 10% of Series A dollars, in the last quarter, ICOs raised 32% as much as Series A startups. For every six Series As, there is one ICO. Series As have declined over the last year as ICOs have become more common. We should expect the difference to continue to narrow. Companies raising ICOs tend to raise more, especially earlier this year, but the median amount raised seems has rapidly approached the median amount raised by Series A companies. Typically, companies raising ICOs are very early in their development - arguably equivalent to a Series A company in terms of progress. In terms of geographic breadth, US ICOs account for 57% of dollars raised across the top five countries. Switzerland, Singapore, Canada and Great Britain round out the top 5. In short, these charts confirm ICOs are a massive source of funding for startups in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They enable startups to raise potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. This new funding mechanism is a fascinating one, and one that raises a few parallels to the IPOs of the dot com era. First, startups raising these ICOs tend to be pre-revenue. Second, retail investors are buying substantial fractions of these offerings. Third, the volatility of these offerings is enormous. If this trend continues and questions like regulation are answered, ICOs may be a novel and important mechanism for crytpocurrency based startups to raise capital. Data source: Crunchbase

One of the major trends facing SaaS companies today is the rising cost of customer acquisition.  Data on this trend has been difficult to find. Fortunately, Patrick at ProfitWell sent me his survey results across about 800 companies. The chart above shows the increasing cost of customer acquisition on a per company basis. Those surveyed have observed a ~65% increase in cost of customer acquisition over the last five years. This increasing customer acquisition cost likely has two root causes. The first is competition . The second is scale. As a company grows, the initial customer acquisition channels become less efficient with saturation. Consequently, the business must develop a portfolio of customer acquisition channels. Typically, each marginal channel has a higher cost of customer acquisition. Regardless of the cause, the impact to unit economics remains the same. Over the next year, companies doing businesses internationally will face a compounding factor: GDPR .  In addition to imposing controls on consumer data, this regulation from the European Union will limit the frequency of outbound email communication to prospective customers dramatically. Instead of email campaigns, sales development reps and account executive serving those geographies will need to find other mechanisms of pipeline generation. One of the critical customer acquisition paths in the next five years for software company will be channel sales . The chart above, from the 2017 Pacific Crest/Key Bank SaaS company survey shows that the fastest growing size companies across the companies surveyed employee channel sales. Inside sales, field sales, internet sales and hybrid strategies see similar growth rates. But channel sales is 62% higher. I don’t have access to the underlying data, so I cannot test for statistical significance, but the sample size suggests that it should be significant. Selling product through existing customers is always cheaper than acquiring new ones. Account expansion requires far less effort than a brand-new sale because there is much less friction. Salespeople do not need to develop trust, establish a relationship, pass security audits and sail through legal. These steps have already been completed with an existing customer. That’s the critical idea behind selling a product through a channel. A reseller or value-added partner already has relationship with the customer. Consequently, the cost of sale should be lower than outbound. And doubly so considering the implications of GDPR in Europe. The secular increasing cost of customer acquisition for SaaS companies is an important trend.  I believe that developing reseller relationships is going to be an increasingly essential competency for SaaS companies once they reach some scale.

Starting in January, public software companies will report their financials using ASC 606.  Normally, accounting changes are not that interesting, but ASC 606 will change several of the key attributes and benchmarks SaaS startups use. The two most important changes are changes to revenue and profitability. Today, all software revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period. If a business finds a 12 month contract for $12,000, the company record $1000 of revenue for each month. Under ASC 606,  hosted revenue recognition doesn’t change. But if the software is run on the customer’s servers, sometimes called an on-premises deployment, the entire revenue value of the contract is recognized immediately, not over the life of the contract. The same is true for renewals. Before, new bookings translated smoothly into revenue, but with the new guidelines, revenue can become quite lumpy. Imagine a $10M ARR company that books a $1M recurring on-premises account in Q1.  That $1M bookings and revenue must be recognized entirely in Q1. If the company books $2M of hosted business in Q2, revenue would fall from $3.5M ($2.5M in hosted recurring revenue plus $1M in on-prem) in Q1 to $3.0 in Q2 ($2.5M in hosted recurring revenue plus $0.5M in new hosted recurring revenue). Metric Q1 Q2 On-Prem Bookings, $M 1.0 0 Hosted Bookings, $M 0 2.0 ARR, $M 11.0 13.0 Revenue, $M 3.5 3 For companies that sell significant amounts of on premises software, this accounting change has the potential to introduce a substantial fluctuation in revenue accounting. Revenue is now less clear a metric of execution predictability than it was previously. In order to understand what’s going on underneath the covers, an investor or analyst examining a business will need to understand bookings by type: hosted or on-premises. The second major change for software companies from ASC 606 is profitability. Public companies will instantly become more profitable starting in 2018. Today, incremental sales are accounted for in the quarter in which they are spent. So if sales commissions cost $1M this quarter, the P&L will show $1M in sales commissions. Starting in 2018, sales commissions will be amortized over the life of the contract. That $1M spent in Q1 will appear as $0.25M in commission costs. This change immediately changes two figures. First, profitability. Net income will increase markedly each quarter and may push many SaaS companies from a median -10% net income to a figure much closer to zero. Management teams then face a question: continue to operate at higher profitability, or invest even more in sales, and remain at -10% net income margin? Second, sales efficiency can no longer be calculated using the P&L, or the benchmark will change, since the quarterly S&M expense has changed. ASC 606 is complicated and will change many other aspects of revenue recognition including utility based pricing, discounting contracts for volumes, and many other attributes. When these changes do take effect, sales and finance teams must work even closer together to ensure contracts are structured properly and don’t introduce undesirable variances in revenue recognition. While public companies must move to this new standard starting in 2018, private companies must move in 2019. With this change, many key metrics and benchmarks will change, as will internal operational practices. I am not an accountant. Consult your accountant for advice about ASC 606.

Last week, I participated in two discussions about the changes in the SaaS world. I believe they are fundamental. The most important force shaping the industry today is competition. The level of competition in many core SaaS segments is intense. Why? The SaaS era is about 20 years old. Salesforce was founded in 1999. Since then, many major categories of software have been saasified. Venture capitalists have financed many of those businesses. Over that 20 year period, annual SaaS investment has increased 20x, peaking in 2014 at $7B. Those venture dollars have financed a panoply of competition. In 2012 ChiefMartec landscape counted 350 vendors selling to sales and marketing. Today, that figure is 5000. The landscape is so vast - and the logos so minuscule - that it’s useful only as an illustration of competition. This sea of SaaS startups have reshaped the market. Incumbent client/server technologies have lost their market dominance to new incumbents. The chart above shows them by buyer. Salesforce for Sales, Workday for HR & Finance, ServiceNow for Operations, Atlassian for Engineering and so on. In addition, the playbook is known. Thousands if not tens of thousands of pages have been written about the marketer, sales developer, inside account executive and customer success play. Most businesses are competing with the same strategies as their competition. This rivalry causes four major responses: Verticalization - compete with a horizontal player by picking one customer segment and building a product better suited to them. Trades market size for better product market fit. Segmentation - focus on SMB, Mid-Market, or Enterprise, to play where competition isn’t present. Feature optimization - develop a product with 20% of the features but 80% of the value, and use a simplified product to challenge the competition. Opting out of starting a company - deciding the timing isn’t right because of the competition. I’ve observed all these trends in the last few years. The fourth has the starkest data. SaaS company formation has fallen by 44% in the last 3 years. I’m using SaaS seed rounds as a proxy metric. I believe competition is a major driving force, especially since venture capital is conspicuously copious. The table stakes in SaaS are rising. But it’s not the MRR milestones or the payback period benchmarks that have changed. They may have increased slightly. Instead, the competitive differentiation ante is much greater. Hawking a SaaS version of a client/server software has been played out, and many buyers will be approached by a collection of competitors with seemingly indistinguishable offerings. Machine learning, broad consolidation, category creation, and new distribution models each will change the SaaS ecosystem in fundamental ways. As the number of new startups ebbs, and major forces in the industry reshape it, I suspect we’re going to see a massive amount of innovation in SaaS, a reinvention after the perfection of a 20 year old playbook.

A startup’s competitive advantage is execution speed. That quickness stems from a CEO’s ability to decide and this ability separates the great from the good. According to a recently published Harvard Business Review article , one of the four key behaviors distinguishing exceptional CEOs is deciding with speed and conviction. [We] discovered that high-performing CEOs do not necessarily stand out for making great decisions all the time; rather, they stand out for being more decisive. They make decisions earlier, faster, and with greater conviction. Because the CEO is the nexus of the company, it’s easy for them to become a bottleneck. By deciding, they push the organization forward. The converse is also true. When a CEO defers a decision, the entire organization waits. Over time, the business may osmose a sluggish culture from its leadership. When critiquing leaders with poor decisiveness, management teams focus on swiftness. 94% of CEOs with poor decisiveness were given that mark because of a lack of speed. Only 5% were called indecisive for inaccacurate decision-making. This statement is remarkably consistent with Principle #200 from Ray Dalio’s book Principles, which is one of my favorites: “Think about the appropriate time to make a decision in light of the marginal gains made by acquiring additional information versus the marginal costs of postponing the decision.” There are three different paths we can take when presented a decision. Yes, no and wait. We often view waiting as a non-decision. It’s often the easiest because it seemingly doesn’t require commitment. But it is a decision with a trade-off. Leaders of any size team know the organization incurs huge cost for that indecision: lost productivity. Everyone waits. Sometimes, deciding quickly isn’t the right thing to do. As Dalio points out, more information may substantially improve the decision-making quality and it’s worth waiting for it. But I find in my life, there many times when waiting will yield no more data, no more insight, no more purchase on the slippery “right” answer. Asking the question, “What marginal information can I gather with time, and how important is that to my decision-making ability?” is an essential step before deciding to wait. The other bit of decision-making wisdom I’ve collected is from Bezos’ 2015 annual letter to Amazon shareholders. There are two kinds of decisions: reversible ones and irreversible ones. Leaders shouldn’t use the same decision-making process for both. Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation…But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors… you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight decision-making process on most decisions… The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We make hundreds, maybe thousands of decisions every day. Improving our decision-making process is probably the single highest leverage investment we can make.  And step one is deciding more quickly when possible, because speed is a sustainable and critical competitive advantage.

Recently, a VP of sales told me about the way he views the dynamic between inside and outside sales. Inside sales is the drumbeat, a highly predictable sales organization whose consistency enables outside sales to swing for the fences. I never heard it expressed quite this way, but I do think there’s some truth to it. To prove it to myself, I ran a Monte Carlo simulation for hypothetical startup. Monte Carlo simulation uses probability to show how things might evolve for this theoretical business. Each team has a 20% chance of closing a lead. The inside team has a 5% chance in months one and two, and a 10% chance in month 3. The outside team has a 5% chance in months 6 through 9 each. The inside team books $50,000 annual contracts and the outside team books $500,000 annual contracts. Quota for the inside team is $750,000 per year and for the outside team is $1 million per year. Both teams attain quota. In this model, the bookings capacity of each team is the same at $3 million. This implies 4 inside reps and 3 outside reps. The chart above shows nine different evolutions of a startup with an inside sales team and an outside sales team. The scenarios can be quite different even if the probabilities are the same across them. In scenario one, the inside sales team is pretty consistent through month 14, but then falls to zero in month 15. It hits a high close to half million dollars worth of bookings in month 8.  In scenario two, the inside team carries the company through month 13 and the outside sales team finally closes two deals in each of the last two months. In scenario five, the outside sales team books more than $1 million in month 10, and another $2 million over the course of the first 15 months. The variety in the scenarios is striking. Contrast the success of the field sales team in scenarios 5 and 7 with scenarios 2 or 1. They feel like very different organizations, don’t they? Even if they are playing the same odds. If we sum the bookings by team over the first 15 months, we can see that differences more plainly. In the first four scenarios, the inside team books substantially more, up to three times the bookings of the outside teams. But in scenarios four and seven, the outside teams outperform. Said another way, the standard deviation of the outside team’s performance is three times greater in this model than the inside team. It’s just more variable because the number of leads is smaller and the sales cycles are longer. This variance reinforces why faster sales cycles are a competitive advantage . Because inside sales teams attain more predictable bookings, even at the small scale, it makes sense that many SaaS startups began with inside sales. More predictable bookings means a shorter time to figuring out how/if we go to market math will work. Also, it helps teams refine and perfect their sales playbooks quicker. Field teams have higher upside, but also higher downside. They are just more variable, at least in the simulation. Reality is more complex The best situation for start up is to have both. By having a steady drumbeat of inside sales bookings and complementing it with the substantial potential upside of outside sales bookings, a SaaS startup can grow consistently and benefit from all the virtues of predictability, while benefiting from the tremendous bookings capacity of an outside team. In this way, the inside team hedges the variance risk of the outside team.

Shopify is an exceptional business. There are not many software companies who can nearly quadruple their enterprise value in two years. But Shopify has grown from $2.7B in enterprise value to more than $10B. What are the metrics behind this behemoth? First, let’s describe the company a bit. Shopify provides e-commerce infrastructure to merchants. They generate revenue in two ways:  subscriptions and merchant services. Merchants pay subscription to rent the software. They pay merchant services for payment fees and other costs that increases the function of the amount of stuff they sell, or Gross Merchandise Value (GMV). Since 2013, Shopify GMV has 10xed from $1.6B to $15.4B. The merchant population has nearly doubled to 201,000 from 120,000. In that time, revenue has increased from $40M to $389M. Shopify has been able to sustain a greater than 90% growth rate for each of the last four years. This is unprecedented. There is no company at this skill that is growing this quickly in the public market. Perhaps most impressive statistic is the sales efficiency which I’ve estimated above. A chart like this is often called a smile chart, for obvious reasons. No others as company I have analyzed has been able to improve sales efficiency as revenue increases. Shopify is just as efficient in converting marketing and sales investment into new gross profit as they were four years ago. In addition, they are 2-3x as efficient as the median, marked in gray. How are they able to sustain more efficient growth as they scale? The first reason is Shopify has been able to grow their contract value by 14% annually. The average subscription payment by merchant has remained flat over the past four years. Instead of growing subscription revenue on a per customer basis, Shopify is capturing more share of GMV. The chart above shows the merchant services revenue generated per billion dollars of gross merchandise value by Shopify. You can see that figure has quite nearly doubled in four years. In other words, as Shopify merchants sell more, Shopify benefits Proportionately from the growth in GMV, but also at an increasing slope because they capture almost twice as much in fees as they have been historically. Consequently, merchant services now account for greater than 50% of revenue up from just above 20% four years ago. The gross margin on the software business has remained 78% over the past four years, while merchant services gross margin has fallen from 50% to 30%.  Overall gross margin has fallen from 80% to 54%. But that is an advantageous trade considering the massive revenue growth. Shopify is in a league of its own when it comes to growth. The business exemplifies the pinnacle of a hybrid SaaS business, leveraging the initial revenue from subscriptions to build a massive GMV-fee business. In addition, Shopify achieves this growth with best-in-class efficiency.

How do you help someone when that person knows substantially more about the question than you do? This is one of the most fundamental and frequent questions in management. I came across it first as a product manager. Then as a manager of teams. And last as a board member. In each of these situations, have interacted with people who knew substantially more about their area of expertise. There are lots of pitfalls when answering the question, “what do you think?” I know, because I’ve suffered through all of them.  Whether it’s arguing by analogy, talking about a bike rack , or arguing with a false sense of confidence based purely on opinion/instinct, each of these reponses has a critical flaw. Ultimately, I’ve landed on a strategy I call decision making auditing. I’ll never know as much about a company’s operations or strategy or a sector as a founder/management team. But, I still want to be helpful. So, the most effective strategy I’ve found so far is to probe how the decision was made. Answer a question with a trenchant question, which coincidentally, ties back to some of the best advice I’ve received from a founder . More specifically, which alternatives were considered, what data was used, which questions were asked, and how is the conclusion ultimately reached? In short, decision making auditing means testing the process rather than the conclusion. When I was a naive Java engineer, I struggled with writing code. I would often ask a more senior engineer for his help. He would tell me to sit and describe the problem. About half way through, I would stop mid-sentence. Just by explaining it, I often saw something new, and a potential solution. Many times, he never said a word, just listened. That’s a critical part of decision-making auditing. As Epictetus said, we have two ears and one mouth for a reason. In other cases, my coding mentor might ask one or two questions, and that would be enough. The most wonderful thing about this style is that it retains the emotional ownership of the decision with the question asker. The two hardest parts of it are fighting the impulse to answer with an opinion and structuring questions properly. I’m curious how others are handling these kinds of questions. If you have a thought, send me a message through the chat window at tomtunguz.com or an email and I’ll publish a follow-up post with the most salient reader feedback.

How much should a SaaS startup invest in sales and marketing at different stages of the business? This is a very nuanced question, but benchmarks do provide some guidance for what is reasonable. Sales and marketing investment depends on many different factors including establishing product market fit, the business’s sales model (inside, field, freemium), and not least, cash balance and fundraising capacity. The chart above shows the sales and marketing investment of publicly traded software companies at different revenue levels. It is a box plot, which means the top and bottom of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles. The line in the middle is the median, and the dots outside the box are outliers. The box marked revenue range 10 indicates the median publicly traded company at between $5M and $10M of revenue spent about 90% of revenue on sales and marketing. Looking in the outer revenue ranges at $25M, $50M and $100M, that figure asymptotes to about 50%. However there are some notable outliers to continue to spend close to 150% or 250% of revenue even at the $100M mark. Another way to answer this question is to use at Pacific Crest’s SaaS survey to build a bottoms up model. You can find mine here . Notably, I assume an 18 month payback period. I also assume that sales represents 65% of customer acquisition cost, which is true for inside sales models according to the survey. Separately, I assume a stratospheric growth rate for this business. Bookings triple, triple, double, double, and double over the first five years. This growth rate is not representative of most SaaS companies, but I wanted to see whether the bottoms of model would yield a much more aggressive sales and marketing spend plan than that observed in the public markets. Last, I estimated revenue from bookings, a calculatoin detailed in the Revenue Estimate tab of my spreadsheet. The table below summarizes the conclusions from the worksheet. Year 1 2 3 4 5 Bookings, $M 1 3 12 24 48 Revenue, $M 0.4 1.5 6.4 17 40 Sales Spend % of Revenue 250% 165% 154% 107% 85% Marketing Spend % of Revenue 134% 89% 83% 57% 46% S&M % of Revenue 384% 253% 237% 164% 130% For our explosively fast-growing SaaS company, we invest 384% of revenue in sales and marketing in the first year. This figure declines to 253% in year two and then falls to 130% in year five. Comparing it to the public charts above, this bottoms up analysis of a top 5% SaaS company suggest that the business will invest substantially more in sales and marketing than the median company. However it is consistent with some of the outliers. If you would like to estimate the amount of sales and marketing investment your SaaS company might make, and test different conditions, download the simple worksheet here and play around with assumptions by changing the cells in red. It’s not a fully fledged model, but a very basic scenario forecasting tool. This worksheet, in combination with the benchmarks provided above, should help you bracket your sales and marketing spend as you grow your SaaS startup.

One of the hardest things for me is to admit is when I’m wrong. It’s hard first to admit it to myself. But harder yet is to admit the error to others. It could be my wife or my colleagues. Most challenging of all is owning the error in a public forum. But admitting mistakes is a key defining attribute of a leader. Owning the mistake accomplishes one critical thing. It builds trust, because it reinforces a fundamental characteristic of our humanity. We are all fallible. I’ve been reading quite a bit about leadership recently, and like many others, I’m fascinated by leadership under great pressure, so I read about Navy SEALS. The stories of heroism under enemy fire inspire me. Extreme Ownership is one of those books. Unlike many others, it stands out because in the first chapter is admission of failure. The author, Jocko Willink, is fearsome. Watch his TED talk , even for 30 seconds. I promise you’ll be intimidated. In the very first chapter of his book, Willink describes a blue-on-blue event, a NATO term for friendly fire. Willink is overseeing an operation in Ramadi and his team mistakes Americans for the enemy, and shoot them. At base, Willink stands before his unit and two of his most senior commanding officers to deliver a report on the blue-on-blue. He assumes all the blame. He was the commanding officer. It’s his men, his team, his battle plan, his mistake. I won’t reveal the rest of the story, but it’s worth reading his book. Earlier this week, one of the most famous behavioral economics famous for writing Thinking Fast and Slow, responded to a critique of his work on social priming . Other researchers haven’t been able to replicate the results. Kahneman’s response: But, have changed my views about the size of behavioral priming effects – they cannot be as large and as robust as my chapter suggested…The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims. Both of these episodes are inspirations for how to respond to mistakes as a leader of a team and a leader within a space. By owning the mistake, Willink and Kahneman expose their humanity and in so doing, build more trust with honesty.

How important is hiring for emotional intelligence? EQ or EI was introduced in 1964 by Michael Beldoch and popularized by Daniel Goleman in 1995. I hear EQ uttered in nearly every job interview and evaluations, and assumed that high EQ correlated to higher job performance. But I read two articles recently that changed my perception of emotional intelligence. Professor Adam Grant wrote Emotional Intelligence is Overrated in 2010. Professor Grant teaches at Wharton. He worked with a CEO who asserted the validity of emotional intelligence as a predictor of performance. After two tests within the sales organization across several hundred people, the data revealed that cognitive ability predicted workplace performance in that company five times better than emotional intelligence. Is this broadly true? A paper published in 2010 called Emotional intelligence: An integrative meta-analysis and cascading model accumulated the largest data set on emotional intelligence until that point. The paper examined three key factors in predicting job performance.  First, cognitive ability: the capacity of an individual to learn. Second, conscientiousness: industriousness and orderliness. Third, emotional stability: ability to regulate emotions. Other personality traits in the BigFive model include extraversion, neuroticism, openess and agreeableness have no predictive power on job performance. Just how effective are each of the three factors of predicting ultimate job performance? Quoting Grant, “Cognitive ability accounted for more than 14% of job performance. Emotional intelligence accounted for less than 1%.” Conscientiousness and emotional stability provide substantially less predictive power than ability to learn. This is true in both high emotional labor roles (sales, customer support) and low emotional labor jobs (programmer, analysts). To date, the data doesn’t support the case that EQ predicts long term success. However, if you perceive EQ to be highly important, how do you improve it or identify it? Professor Lisa Feldman Barrett of Northeastern University published Emotional Intelligence Needs a Rewrite .  She introduces the idea of emotional granularity, which suggests that emotional intelligence can be learned by using more precise words to describe how you feel. Training yourself that way enables you to recognize those emotions in others. Searching for that lexicon in interviews is one way of identifying it. Each new word seeds your brain with the capacity to make new emotion predictions, which your brain can employ as a tool to construct your future experiences and perceptions, and to direct your actions. Instead of perceiving someone as generically “glad,” learn to distinguish more specifics. Are they “overjoyed” or “contented” or “grateful?” Are they “angry” or “indignant” or “resentful” or “bitter?” My brief foray into the world of EQ research highlighted two key concepts. First, cognitive ability remains the leading predictor of job performance. To date, research hasn’t been able to prove the predictive power of the remaining Big Five personality traits. So, only a small part of what we normally name EQ, conscientiousness, is incrementally predictive of performance. But if you still would like to be perceived at work with a higher emotional intelligence, the best way to do it is to improve the vocabulary you use to describe your emotional state, so you can identify it in others.

One of the most difficult go-to-market strategies for startups is platform. Platform go to markets mean selling software that can do many things, depending on the customer need. Selling a platform is challenging for five reasons. First, most customers buy software to solve a particular and immediate problem. When pitching a platform, the potential buyer has to imagine what the platform can do for them. On the other hand, point solutions present a more concrete alternative of what is, rather than what could be. Second, most platforms don’t solve a problem out of the box, so the buyer won’t receive the benefit immediately. Configuration, customization, integration require engineering time and budget. In contrast, point solutions are ready to go. Third, broad platforms can complicate the sales process. The broader the platform, the more likely other departments seek a voice in the decision. Instead of a one-party decision, now the purchasing process is a party-of-many, which isn’t a party at all, because it means the sales process lengthens. Fourth, solution selling, which resolves some of the problems above by creating out-of-the-box point solutions on top of the platform, fragments the team. Solution sales mitigates some of the challenges above. But, solution sales fragments the marketing and sales teams. Typically, account executives specialize in solutions. They also require dedicated marketing presentations, call scripts and battle cards. Specialization works well, but only if the team is large enough to be divided. Fifth, the ecosystem must be sophisticated enough to understand, appreciate and prefer the value of a broader platform. Platforms provide more flexible solutions to customers. Consequently, customers must understand the nuances of their needs quite well. Platform go-to-market strategies can be very successful. But they introduce some additional complexity to the sales process that must be managed.

Every startup’s sales commission plan is different. But it’s key to understand the theory and the benchmark data that governs the creation of sales commission plans to create a good one for your business. Before we begin, let’s define a few terms. Sales compensation is communicated in OTE, On Target Earnings. OTE has two parts: salary/draw and commission. Salary is the annual amount paid to the employee irrespective of how much business he/she closes. Commission is the percentage of bookings awarded to the account executive in reward of the customers they close, adjusted by some multiplier. When you say OTE, you imply 100% quota attainment and the multiplier is one. In summary, OTE earnings is the amount of money the account executive will be paid if the AE attains the quota exactly. The chart above demonstrates three different theoretical sales commission plans. The x-axis is quota attainment – the percentage of the booking goal the account executive attained. The y-axis indicates the commission multiplier. Two gray lines intersect at 100% quota attainment and a 1 OTE multiplier. That is OTE. The flat strategy is the most basic. If the AE attains 90% quota, they are paid 90% of their commission. If the AE attains 110% quota, they are paid 110% of their commission. The linear strategy is an offset. If AE attains 90% quota, they are paid 80% of their commission. If they attain 110% of quota, they are paid 120% commission. The formula for this one is: quota attainment - 10% if under quota; quota attainment + 10% if over quota. The geometric strategy is even more extreme than the offset strategy but with the same idea. Massively overcompensate those who crush quota, and penalize those who don’t. At a 90% quota attainment, pay 50% commission. At 115% quota attainment, pay 180% commission. These three strategies are quite different. When to use each one? At the very early stages of a startup, sales hiring is critical. The management team may make a strategic decision to overcompensate early account executives for two reasons. First, to create stability within the account executive team and prevent competitive poaching. Second, to encourage the successful account executives to recruit their friends. Since they are making so much money, and the product is easy to sell, why wouldn’t they join? The downside to paying much higher commissions is the cost to the business both in cash but also in efficiency metrics. The higher the cost of sales, the lower the sales efficiency. The greater the commissions, the greater the burn rate. Let’s compare the costs of these three different strategies. If you would like to examine the math behind this table, see this Google Spreadsheet . Quota Attainment 90% 95% 100% 105% 110% 115% Flat 9% 10% 10% 11% 11% 12% Linear 8% 9% 10% 12% 12% 13% Geometric 5% 8% 10% 12% 14% 18% At on target earnings, all of these sales commissions plans cost 10% of bookings. At the lower end, 90% of quota attainment, these plans span 5% to 9%. At the upper end, they spent 11.5% to 18%. What’s the right ballpark? Fortunately, the 2016 Pacific Crest Survey of private companies indicates that the median is 9% for inside sales teams and 10% for field teams. So the geometric plan is the most expensive in the success case. To determine whether it’s worth it for your business, you would want to understand the implied impact to sales efficiency and ultimately cash flow dynamics. Can the business’s balance sheet sustain a commission payout twice the benchmark median? When designing a sales compensation plan, it’s important to take into account the overall goals of the business including hiring an account executive retention, in addition to the desired efficiency of the sales organization. By calculating the commission rate and comparing it to benchmarks, your management team can determine exactly which trade-offs to make. Again, this is the most basic form of a sales commission plan, but it serves to explain the theory and the impact on other metrics.

Your startup is growing. You suspect you have initial product market fit. Time to hire the first head of each department. Sales, marketing, customer success, engineering, product management. Some founders might have experience or exposure into one of these teams. But rarely do they understand every one well enough to hire the right department chief. How should you do it? I’ve observed three successful strategies. First, do the job yourself. Great managers manage themselves out of a job . By doing the work yourself first, you’ll know exactly what the role entails and what questions to ask. You’ll have the experience to judge whether a candidate can outperform you in that role. This is a common strategy for sales. The founders confirm product market fit with the first 10-20 sales and then hire an expert to scale the team and polish the process. Second, enlist experts from your network and your advisors. Some founders ask advisors to interview candidates directly. Others ask experts to sit through a few interviews to coach, and share observations about candidates. With this strategy, the key is to continue to solicit advice from advisors and experts about how to manage the new leader from those experts after they have been hired. Third, experiment in a high-velocity, low-cost way. Some founders prefer to hire entry-level teams to staff a new department. They select people who can figure things out, rather than those who might have a track record in the space. The hire and fire quickly until the right person is found and then promote from within. I’ve seen each of these approaches work. Tradeoffs exist for each one. Some require more investment of a founder’s time. Some skew for more junior teams. Some require substantial coordination. Which one is best for your business is a judgement call.

I commuted to my first job on a bicycle.  With my parent’s help, I bought a lemon yellow second-hand road bike that I pedaled 20 miles each way from 30th and N streets in Georgetown, Washington DC, over bustling Chain Bridge and the languid Potomac to an office park buried in Tyson’s Corner in Virginia. That was my workout each week. Then I moved to California and retired the bike. When I started working at Google, I spent the hour on the Google shuttle from San Francisco to Mountain View emailing. Today, I drive most places. For the past few months, I’ve been listening to stand-up comedy. I’m trying to be funnier, but it’s not working. But at least I’m laughing while maneuvering through SOMA morning traffic. Sometimes, I blend in some podcasts from time to time including Invest Like the Best and Software Engineering Daily. I also try to schedule telephone calls. I’ve often felt that my current commute is my least productive. Until last week. Now, for the first 20 minutes of my drive to the next meeting, I manage my email. One of our portfolio companies, Astro, released a feature that allows you to do something that I’ve dreamt about since watching the movie Her. Astro reads me my email , and allows me to respond just by talking. Instead of waking up and looking at my email first thing, I wait until I get into the car. “Astro, read my email.” Then, I can archive messages that I’m not interested in. I can skip over messages that require work or until I’m back at my desk by saying “Snooze till Desktop.” Last, I can simply respond to Astro’s voice with my answer. These kinds of experiences are the future of human computer interaction (HCI) - a conversation. A back-and-forth between a human voice and the computer voice, each one listening, each one speaking, collaborating to achieve something. We are still in the early days of this technology, but these inklings provided glimpses into the future of how computers will disappear into our background, but help us accomplish more than they ever have . If you commute, check out Astro. I can’t promise it’s as funny as Aziz Ansari’s woeful dating life, but you’ll have an empty inbox by the time you get to work.

A founder asked me if we had reached the point that SaaS is commodified. “Can you build a venture scale SaaS company anymore?” He made three key points to support the argument. First, the technology barriers to starting a SaaS company continue to fall. Amazon, Google and Microsoft provide sophisticated, scalable, and easy to use infrastructure as a service. Next-generation machine learning tools are also available by API and improving all the time. Second, the customer acquisition playbook is well known. Whether it’s Predictable Revenue written by Aaron Ross or Mark Roberge’s The Sales Acceleration Formula, or others, authoritative texts describe step by step how to structure, manage and measure a SaaS sales team. Consequently, this go to market model is no longer a differentiator in the market. Third, the costs of customer acquisition have risen. Whether it’s Facebook ads, LinkedIn ads, Google search engine marketing and retargeting, email marketing, or outbound calling, all of these channels bear some hallmarks of saturation. Response rates are declining, depressing conversion rates, and raising the cost of customer acquisition. The surge of venture capital in the last five years worsens this predicament. These three points are all true. I will add another. The sheer number of vendors overwhelms potential buyers. Distinguishing one from another is hard. Marketing messages overlap, sales pitches sound similar, and buyers must use the products in order to truly understand the nuances among them. This shouldn’t depress you, but exhilarate you. Here’s why. A product that is hard to sell isn’t the right product. Product market fit hasn’t been established or the product simply isn’t differentiated enough from the rest of the market. As the number of SaaS businesses serving sales and marketing has grown from 500 to more than 4000 over the last few years, saturation is inevitable. So are copycats. If no entrant in a particular category has established product market fit, and budget exists, there must exist an opportunity for a new startup to develop the right product. Also, if everyone is using the same go to market playbook, there’s an opportunity to develop a new one. Inside sales models. Inbound lead generation through content marketing. Mobile app distribution. Advertising on consumer platforms to drive B2B sales. All of these are advances that go to market teams have developed in the last 10 years. We will see many more. I don’t know what they will look like. Perhaps they will be channel based. Perhaps they will leverage virality and word-of-mouth. I don’t know. But I do know, this is the moment, when everyone else is following the same playbook, to develop a new play. Both of these statements are simple statements but they are hard. It is hard to find product market fit. Most startups fail because they don’t. Developing a new customer acquisition channel might sound simple, but it’s rare. Regardless, a collection of founders will do exactly both of those things, and in so doing, evolve the software world one more time.

We’ve seen quite a bit of volatility in the valuations of publicly traded software companies over the last 5 years. In 2014, the average software company traded at 7.7x forward revenues - the sum of projected revenues over the next 12 months. Two years later, that multiple dropped 57% to 3.3x. Today, we’re exactly where we were in 2013, at 5.4x, which is coincidentally, is the average over this time period. The average figure masks the substantial variance in forward muliples.  By breaking out the multiples on a stock by stock basis, we expose the true distribution. Veeva (VEEV) tops the list at 11.6x forward while MobileIron plays cleanup at 1.5x. In addition to the broad range of multiples, some of these businesses has seen tremendous volatility. HortonWorks and LivePerson have seen greater than 90% increases in forward multiples, while Zendesk and Twilio observed contractions of 32% and 64%. Last, the box plot demonstrates that the majority of companies fit within a narrow band. But we are starting to see a handful more outliers, whose multiples are two standard deviations above the median. The red box indicates the range of companies between the 25th and 75th percentiles. Overall, the data suggests that the median forward multiple of 5.5X is a good summary metric for long-term analysis of next generation software companies. But the distribution and the variances year-over-year indicate that there’s quite a bit of movement in forward multiples, depending on the particulars of each business. This public market data mirrors to some extent of the behavior of the private market. Namely, while the forward multiple for most private SaaS companies has fallen in the last year or so, the most sought after businesses are commanding some of the highest multiples we’ve seen in 24 months.

Harry Stebbins published a podcast with David Beisel this week in which they discussed the importance of voice. David says, “Voice is the most natural user interface possible.”  I think the biggest challenge for voice is the skepticism and cynicism engendered by a decade or two of poor experiences. It’s no longer the technology. One of my partners recently switched from an iPhone to an Essential phone and was stunned by the accuracy of the voice interface Google offers. Voice has become far more sophisticated than just a few years ago, and we are quickly moving past the stage of toy applications. I’ve written before about how each of my emails are dictated. This blog post is dictated and edited entirely by voice. If I make a mistake, I can say “insert semicolon after dictated” and the computer will insert the; after the word dictated. If I’m curious about cash conversion cycle, I can stop in the middle of the sentence, and say “search Google for cash conversion cycle”. My Mac will launch Chrome and issue the query in Google. When I’m done, I say “close window” which closes Chrome and “switch to Typora”, which is the name of my favorite text editor for writing blogs. Then I can can continue speaking and drafting this post. When I speak the command “publish blog post,” the computer executes a shell script which does four things. First, a program verifies the syntax of a new blog post. Second, a script resizes the images I use in that post to the optimal size and format for the website. Third, Hugo, the static blog engine I use, compiles website. Fourth, it calls the Amazon Web Services command line interface to synchronize the local website I just compiled to S3. That happens less than four seconds, in the background, all from a voice command. If I’m researching a company, I can say “research Looker”. The computer will open up four tabs in Chrome - RelateIQ, Crunchbase, Mattermark, LinkedIn -  and issue the query in each of those services so that when they have all loaded, I’m looking at the Looker page in each of those services. Voice assists with small things too. I can also move windows around my desktop by saying top left, bottom right and the windows will resize. “Play music” starts Spotify. “Next song” changes the music.  I can say “Gmail” in my email will load. “Open” opens the first email. “Reply” begins a reply. “Send to Asana” forwards the email to Asana and then archives that message. I read about an engineer who configured his voice dictation software to allow him to write code entirely by speaking to his computer. Imagine typing C++ code by speaking it. For someone who is native in the language, it’s far more natural, and up to three times quicker than typing. Plus no more RSI issues. We’re simply not that far away from incredibly sophisticated applications and uses of voice technology when interacting with computers. We are seeing voice become a common use case within the home with Alexa and Google Home. Or in the car, by dictating text messages that you are going to be late or asking for navigation instructions. That familiarity and consumer use cases will  dissolve the skepticism users have  accumulated over years of disappointing experiences. Voice will come to the office in a very big way and enable far more sophisticated and complex use cases than we have seen in the past from data input to sophisticated analysis .

The cash conversion cycle is a key metric for startups, but one that often isn’t talked about until a business hires a CFO. Once a business established product market fit, the cash conversion cycle is a key metric of a company’s cash efficiency - how quickly a company can convert a dollar of investment into a dollar of cash flow. To calculate the cash conversion cycle for a software company, the formula is `CCC = Sales cycle + Accounts Receivable Latency - Accounts Payable Latency Sales cycle is the number of days from first engaging a customer to when the customer signs a contract. Accounts receivable latency is the amount of time from the contract being signed to the customer paying for the service. Accounts payable is the number of days from when the business receives its bills and when it pays them. That’s all a bit amorphous so let’s compare two hypothetical situations. Case Sales Cycle AR AP CCC Short Cycle 45 30 30 45 Long Cycle 270 90 30 330 In the case of the Short Cycle, the CCC is 45 days compared to 330 for the Long Cycle. Why is this so important to a business? For the same reasons payback periods are critical . The faster an invested dollar is recouped, the sooner the business can invest it again in lead generation, sales development and account executives. In the Short Cycle, the business can buy $1 worth of leads every 45 days. In the Long Cycle, the business must wait nearly one year before investing that dollar. Either the Long Cycle company must raise much more capital, and be diluted further, or it will grow more slowly. Of the three parts of the cash conversion cycle, only one component is determined by the go to market organization: the sales cycle. The other two parts, accounts payable and accounts receivable, are the responsibilities of the finance teams. By collecting payments from customers promptly, the finance team improves the CCC of the business. More cash to invest in growth sooner. And by negotiating for better payment terms, a longer time to pay bills, the finance team keeps more dollars in the company’s accounts to invest. For example, if the Short Cycle startup can negotiate 90 day payment terms and their CCC is 45 days, they could theoretically invest a dollar twice in growth before paying it to a supplier. The paragraph above illustrates why CCC is a metric most startups begin to measure after hiring a CFO. The finance team is a critical part of managing CCC. But the sooner the business can understand, measure and tune its CCC, the more sooner the business can reinvest dollars to grow faster.

“Would you compare a bootstrapped SaaS company to a seeded company? At what point does the bootstrapped company have to raise if it’s profitable, if ever?” One founder asked me this question recently. I hesitate to compare and contrast bootstrapped and venture backed businesses, because I’m a venture capitalist and it’s very easy to dismiss any analysis as biased in favor of venture investment. As I’ve said countless times, there are many ways of building a very successful business. Atlassian in the best known bootstrapped software company and it’s worth nearly $8B as I write this. Only a handful of next-generation, venture backed software companies are larger:  Salesforce, Workday, Palo Alto Networks. I’m only going to consider the financial differences between the two models. With those caveats, let’s continue. To compare the differences between a bootstrap and a venture business, I’ve created a very basic financial model on Google spreadsheets .   You can download this model or clone it in your Google docs to play around with it. Again it’s very basic. Here’s the scenario. Imagine two founders start a company. They sell email marketing software for $5k annually on average, with a 14 month payback period. They agree on a few management principles early on. First, they invest 30% of their total cash in customer acquisition no matter the state of the business. Second, for every 100 customers, they hire another employee. All employees cost $50k per year. They spend six months building the product before they acquire their first customer. When they do pay to acquire a customer, they must invest the CAC dollars two months ahead of revenue (60 day sales cycle). As they grow the business, these two founders experience no churn, collect revenue monthly, and observe that for every 10 paid customers, 3 new customers arrive organically. Last, they value their business at 7x revenues; and their execution in both cases is flawless. Let’s create two universes. In the bootstrapped case, the founders keep all of their equity and invest $150k of their own money. In the seed case, they sell 25% to investors for $1.5M. Here’s the punchline. The key financial difference between the two companies is speed. The company that raises the seed round has more capital to acquire customers earlier in its life. These customers generate more revenue sooner, which can be reinvested to acquire more customers, hire more employees, and so on. The 10x larger seed round gets the flywheel spinning faster, and so the company attains a faster growth rate quicker. Reverting to the original question, when should a profitable company raise capital, if ever? The answer is the same for all businesses regardless of financing history: Raise capital when you are confident that you can use it to attain a higher growth rate and the higher growth rate is worth a trade-off in dilution. Higher growth rates increase the value of a business . Higher growth rates fetch greater multiples. There are tradeoffs to raising capital. You must sell equity and dilute your stake. You will likely grant a board seat to an investor. The investor may have an opinion on how to run the business and his/her own motivations, that ideally, but not always, align with yours. These are just a few. Venture capital is not the right capital source for most businesses for many reasons. This analysis isn’t perfect. It simplifies many things, and only evaluates this question on metrics. But I hope the rudimentary financial model provides founders with some initial framework for comparing two financing strategies.

Invest Like the Best is one of my favorite podcasts. Hosted by Patrick O’Shaugnessy, Invest Like the Best profiles investors from many different disciplines. Recently, New York seed investor Jerry Neumann spoke on the show and talked about three key ideas on the technology innovation cycle. First, he discussed reading Carlota Perez Technological Surge Cycle. I first read Perez’ book after Fred Wilson wrote about it . Jerry describes the theory very well in about 10 minutes. The key idea is each technology cycle lasts 70 years, and is broken into two phases installation and deployment. The installation phase requires huge amounts of capital to create infrastructure. Perez calls this capital finance capital. Finance capital is risk seeking capital, which is distinct from operational capital, the cash on corporate balance sheets. It’s nearly impossible for most companies to invest in speculative technologies like Bitcoin three years ago, because the business case for return on investment simply can’t be made credibly. During the deployment phase, new technology advances diffuse through the world and change people’s lives. The investment risks are lessened, because infrastructure exists, business models are clearer and demand more apparent.  Consequently, operational capital is now used to further technology adoption. Second, Jerry distinguishes between uncertainty and risk. Insurance companies deal in risk. Risk can be measured, analyzed and hedged. Uncertainty, as defined by Frank Knight, a professor at the University of Chicago, is impossible to quantify. No one really knows what will happen. The very earliest companies all face uncertainty. Later stage businesses defuse that uncertainty into risk. There’s a parallel in Perez’ installation and deployment phases. Third, technology revolutions are systems that only move as quickly as the limiting factor. The American diner revolutionized restaurants in the US. But it wasn’t the car that gave rise to the diner. Gas stations popped up every 100 miles with service stations. Interchangeable parts and novel manufacturing techniques reduced automobile prices. But, it was the creation of tens of thousands of interstate highways by Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System in the 1950s and 60s that changed the American landscape. Each of those parts, in addition to others, was essential. Overall, the interview is wide ranging and a fascinating 90 minute tour of technology revolutions, and the impacts for modern Startupland. If you’re looking for a deeper summary of the interview, Conor Witt has written one here .

At some point in the life of most SaaS companies, the business will be faced with the question, when should we move up market? The strategic question might be catalyzed by increasing cost of customer acquisition in the core SMB segment . Alternatively,  a surge of large customers paying for the product might trigger the question. Or account executives might raise it. Whatever the reason, this is a key strategic question. Moving upmarket is an experiment. It’s a new sales motion. Very few businesses have clear demonstration of success in enterprise sales cycles without effort. The first step in deciding when to move up market is an asset allocation question . How much cash is the management team willing to invest into the enterprise experiment? This is risk tolerance. How much investment is required to fully test experiment?  Critical for ensuring the effort has enough runway to succeed. In addition, enterprise sales often requires more staff than SMB sales. Field marketing and sales engineering are two essential roles in enterprise sales that have no counterpart in SMB. Given those two figures and the cash balance of the business is now the right time? The second consideration involves metrics of the sales funnel. Does the business provide enough prospective customer pipeline to enable an enterprise account executive to exceed quota? Do the unit economics associated with a different kind of fundamental unit of growth that includes field marketing and sales engineering pencil out? Third, to what degree do the SMB and enterprise roadmaps overlap?  If a SaaS company can build the same product to serve both constituencies,  then the product and engineering organizations should not need to endure substantially more stress to satisfy both. If on the other hand, the demands are unique to each segment, is the business ready to handle diverging product roadmaps? Alternatively, is the business ready to downshift innovation on the SMB product, and invest more in the enterprise product? The same question also applies to marketing. Can a single marketing message work for both segments? Lastly, is the company culture ready to sustain a different sales motion? Some companies eschew the idea of selling into two different segments, preferring to treat most customers similarly. Is the management team ready to respond to increasing demands from sales teams on product management, customer success and marketing?

Last week, I wrote about the decline of investments in San Francisco startups . On Hacker News, this post engendered a lengthy conversation on the challenges facing founders and start-up employees in San Francisco. In short, the cost of living in San Francisco and the Bay Area has reached untenable and unacceptable heights for many. The average one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco costs $3500 per month . That is simply astronomical. It’s 30% more expensive than Manhattan. I don’t know what the right long-term solution is. I don’t know enough about the history of the laws, the demographics, the politics, the influence of inexpensive capital and the real estate investment market to opine. But, as they always do, founders of finding innovative ways of navigating these challenges. The most salient change is labor market arbitrage. Labor market arbitrage is not new. Israeli founders have been doing this for years. Many Israeli companies hire go-to-market teams in Silicon Valley, but build research and development teams in Israel. Today, it’s quite common to meet startups who house their product and engineering centers in Portland, Vancouver, Toronto, Beijing, Waterloo, Paris, or London. Some companies are even relocating their headquarters to these geographies after getting off the ground in the valley. The advantages of these remote locations include lower salary costs, higher standards of living for employees, greater ability to retain employees, less competition and consequently higher retention. In addition, many of these geographies offer tax advantages to start up companies. Equally importantly, the persistent visa issues that have become more challenging are moot in many of these places. Historically, the challenges associated with remote teams have outweighed the benefits. But today, the equilibrium is shifting for many founders.  distributed teams are more common, and companies know what to expect when managing remote offices. Collaboration tools have improved. Next-generation chat, video calling, and project management software help keep teams in sync. Perhaps most importantly, there are now many examples of very successful businesses with distributed teams. The good news for startups is fundraising market is largely efficient and regional differences in investment profiles are minor . As startups blossom in many more geographies than they have in the past, investors will look to spread their blanket of capital more broadly. The conversation on Hacker News illustrates the cost of living challenges for founders and employees are real, painful, and an important shaping force of Startupland whose consequences are changing the way startups are built.

Just where is the US venture market relative to the rest of the world? After most US analyses I publish, a few founders in other geographies ask questions about their own. These inquiries made me wonder, how has the global market evolved? The chart above shows the compound annual growth rate of venture investment rounds A through D in ten fastest growing venture markets plus the US from 2010-2016. The USA is slowest growing market across that six year span at 12% CAGR. Meanwhile, Korea, China and Japan take the top three spots. Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and Ireland follow at four, fix and six. It’s wonderful to see the expansion of venture capital across these geographies and especially at very healthy growth rates. A 50% growth rate sustained over 6 years implies 11x growth in venture capital investment during the period. The US, meanwhile, grew 75%. Turning to the median size of an investment, the data reveals China tops the list at $30M in round size. Ireland follows at $16.5M with the USA, Japan and Hong Kong all at $10M. The missing piece of data concerning round size is the valuation metrics. A $10M round in the US might buy 20-25% of a business. What does a $3M round buy in Brazil or a $6M round buy in India? I’m not sure. If we look at aggregate venture dollars raised in a year, two immediate, obvious and important conclusions surface. First, US and Chinese startup markets have raised an order of magnitude more capital than any other country of countries raised at these growth rates. India at $2.2B in investment is 6% of the US market. This chart illustrates the depth of the capital pool available to startups. Note these charts only includes the top 10 fastest growing countries in venture investment. Israel, a notable exception, saw $1.1B invested in 2016, with a growth rate of 19%. Second, in 2016, Chinese venture investors invested $30B, and that amount grew 19% over 2015. Should that trend continue, in two years or sooner, the Chinese venture market will exceed the US in size. This milestone could accelerate in particular because the US market is reverting to the mean after the 2014-2015 heyday. Last, the time series analysis illuminates the countries that are seeing geometric and uninhibited growth in venture capital investment: China, Hong Kong, Japan, UAE/ARE, and Ireland.  Australia, Brazil, India, and Korea investing activity has mirrored the US, with a striking rise and recent fall. Meanwhile, Singapore oscillates is nearly binary, between zero and $600M invested annually. The global market for venture is growing. Outside of the US, China and India, the markets aren’t deep. But if these other geographies sustain similar growth rates to the past ten years, the startup fundraising environment will look very different than it does today.

Tell me three numbers and I can estimate the amount of capital your startup will need to raise. Which figures are those? The startups’ revenue target, the average revenue per customer and the average cost of customer acquisition. For example, I’d like to estimate the cost for my SaaS startup to reach $100M in annual recurring revenue (ARR). My typical customer pays $25k average contract value (ACV) and my cost of customer acquisition (CAC) is $29k. I estimate a 14 month payback, which is the average according to the 2016 PacCrest survey. To calculate CAC, we take the 14 months of payback divide by 12 months and multiply by the ACV. To reach $100M requires 4,000 customers. Each of the 4,000 customers cost on average $29k. This math implies spending $116M to acquire those customers. This estimate is remarkably accurate for Marketo. Our little equation estimates that Marketo would have required $62M to reach $53M in revenue at IPO. Marketo burned $64M to reach that revenue milestone, an error of just 3%. How would accurate is this equation across a larger number of companies? The chart above plots the actual burn of ten next generation software companies compared to the estimated burn. To calculate the burn, I’ve subtracted the amount of cash on the company balance sheet at IPO from the total amount raised. The model isn’t perfect. Predictions vary from a 3% difference for Marketo to a 62% difference for Okta. But the R Squared, a simple measure of the accuracy of our model, is 0.78. This means the model explains 78% of the variance, which is pretty good for such a simple equation. This equation fails to consider many, many things. To name a few: How long the company bootstraps. Whether the business collects cash up front. Whether the business executes growth consistently or endures some period of correction. No consideration for churn. It also assumes a company is venture backed and that it wants to grow at a rate similar to other publics. Last, I used a small data set which excludes outliers like Atlassian and Box. In short, it’s no substitute for a real financial model. But it’s a pretty good back of the envelope estimate.

During every person’s working life, there comes a time when you have a question that could be answered by having access to the right data. Unfortunately, the time and effort required to find that data, package it the right way, and send it to an analytics or business intelligence tool present a formidable obstacle to answering the question. Two years ago, Redpoint partnered with Dremio to solve this problem. This morning, after an enormous amount of hard work from the team, the company has made its product publicly available . Interviewing data analysts as part of a year long research project, we kept hearing the same three problems things. First, how do I find the data that I need? In any company of scale, there might be tens to hundreds of different data sets. Which is the right one for my needs? Second, I need to combine these data sets in a the right way, but each data set speaks a different language: Elastic, Hadoop, Oracle, MySQL, HBase, S3 and so on. I might know one or two of these languages, but most users haven’t attained fluency in all of them. Third, once I’ve synthesized the data set I need to answer a question, I want to publish that data to an analytics or BI tool. How can I make sure that this new data set is available to a Looker Look or a Tableau worksheet? Fourth, I want all this data to be up-to-date, and fast, so when I analyze the data set, everything happens quickly and I can iterate to answer my question fully. Dremio solves all of these problems. In the same way that Amazon Web Services democratized software infrastructure for engineers, Dremio empowers data analysts to find, create and publish the data sets they require, simply and quickly. Dremio is the software that enables Self-Service Data access.

Bloomberg published a post this weekend called San Francisco’s VC Boom is Over . The article pointed to the seeming collapse in the amount of venture capital raised by San Francisco startups relative to other regions. The slowing of venture investment more broadly across the US serves as a backdrop to San Francisco’s particularly strong correction. I was curious about the drivers of these trends, so I ran my own analysis. If we plot San Francisco startup fundraising activity through the first six months of the year,  rounds A through D, beginning in 2010, we see the surge during the 2014-2015 heyday and then a reversion to an elevated mean in 2016 and 2017. Note, the levels still exceed 2010-2013. But the 50% decline is real. Series As and Bs certainly have declined to some extent, falling about 50% each. But the real drivers in the fall of San Francisco’s overall numbers are the 66% and 75% falls of Series C and Series D. There could be two explanations for this fall. The first is investors in those rounds have pulled out of the market. The second is that the wave of companies born in the early 2010s that needed to raise large Cs and Ds have already done so. I think the reality is a combination of both. The market is cyclical for both investors and founders. But if we look at the total amount of money raised by Valley companies, which I’ve defined as SF Bay Area companies not headquartered in San Francisco, 2017 shows a 50% jump in the first six months compared to 2014-2016. That’s a reversal from San Francisco, and the industry broadly. If we compare San Francisco to the Valley by round, Series Bs and Series Ds have increased markedly in the valley in 2017. Series As and Cs are roughly similar. Because of the varying behavior of Series C and D investors across geographies, (invest less in San Francisco but invest more in the valley), I can’t argue that late stage investors have pulled out of the market broadly. The startups raising hundreds of millions or billions might bias the data, I thought. But removing Uber, AirBnB and their ilk doesn’t change these trends materially. Might a consumer/enterprise regional hypothesis work? More consumer companies in San Francisco. More enterprise businesses in the valley. The data doesn’t support that hypothesis. E.g., Twilio and Github in San Francisco. Essential and Robinhood in the valley. In the valley, Menlo Park and Palo Alto are benefitting from record fundraising periods. GRAIL raised $900M earlier this year in their Series B, which provides most of the gain for Menlo Park. Palo Alto is more distributed across Essential, Rubrik, Robinhood and many others. If we examine seed round activity, the data shows the number of seed rounds across these two regions is highly correlated. San Francisco may have reached a higher peak, but that trend is transient. We have ruled out investors pulling out of the market broadly, a sector rotation from consumer into enterprise, and differences in regional company formation as causes. Other analyses we could run would be the correlation of fundraising with real estate prices, average round sizes by round and city, the impact of VCs starting offices in San Francisco, but I suspect none of those matter. Ultimately, I don’t believe there’s any real driver for a reduction in San Francisco startup fundraising activity that’s meaningful or important. It’s just so happens that startups in the valley are having a strong six months while San Francisco startups are raising less. The data shows those San Francisco companies have raised plenty in the past few years. Now it’s the Valley startups’ turn to raise. And some of these rounds are sufficiently large to meaningfully change the numbers. A billion here and a billion there certainly changes the complexion of the charts. But this volatility suggests a trend that isn’t supported by a broader cause.

I’ve asked many VPs of Sales the same question. Which is the best book on the fundamentals of selling? Almost unequivocally, they respond, “Miller-Heiman.” The New Strategic Selling is an updated version of the original Strategic Selling, which was published in 1988, and describes the key activities of successful sales people. I resonated with two concepts in the book: the 4 Seller Response Modes and the authors’ recommendations on how to prioritize a salesperson’s time. The 4 Seller Modes classify the prospect’s state of mind. This is important because, “Anytime you’re asking someone to buy something, you’re asking them to make a change.” Determining the prospect’s mindset helps a salesperson determine if the prospect is ready to make a change, or not; and how to respond. To convert a prospect to a buyer, a salesperson must establish the discrepancy between the prospect’s current state and their ideal state; and establish that the salesperson’s product will resolve it. Growth mode prospects recognize the gap between where they find themselves and their ideal. They are driven by the desire to do more and ready to buy. Troubled buyers fear the current situation and search for a solution to their perceived or real problems. Even-keeled prospects don’t perceive a problem. They are very difficult to sell to. The same is true of Overconfident prospects who don’t believe or see an issue in their state of affairs. No discrepancy, no sale. These 4 Seller Modes provide a succinct categorization of prospects. Moving onto sales time prioritization, Miller and Heiman recommend prioritizing efforts in an unusual pattern. Closing work on the highest quality leads Prospect new leads Qualify existing leads Move the existing leads through the funnel To rank prospecting as the second most important activity seemed counterintuitive to me. I would have thought moving backwards up through the funnel would have been the optimal. But the authors submit that building the top of the funnel is more important than moving other leads through the funnel. This order maximizes consistency of leads in the funnel and leads to more predictable pipeline and income for the sales person. I’m curious how modern account executives manage their time. If you have a point of view, please send me a comment using the chat box at tomtunguz.com. Overall, Strategic Selling is a very mechanized approach to selling effectively.  I haven’t touched on other frameworks introduced in the book including the four buying influences, territory management or other key sales books. The book is a comprehensive guide to the processes and frameworks for maximizing sales success.

At some point in the life of your company, you may consider selling the business. Every acquisition process might run a little bit differently, but these are some of the patterns that I have observed after about nine years in the venture business, and also having evaluated a handful of acquisitions when I was at Google. There are two key constituencies within the buyer: the business owner and corporate development. Corporate development is often the first point of contact, and while they are a critical component of executing the transaction, it is ultimately the business owner who will champion the acquisition through the approval process. The role of a corporate development team within a company is to surface potential acquisition targets for business units. They are scouts, trying to match an external startup and an internal business owner in a beneficial merger.  Once a business owner is interested in a potential target, the corporate development team manages the process. To champion an acquisition, a business owner must develop a compelling business case to justify the transaction and convince themselves it is worth the risk to pursue it.  This business case can take many forms. It can be a buy versus build decision. Does the business owner buy an existing company/technology to get to market faster? Does the acquisition target have a team with unique skills that would be difficult/expensive to recruit? It can also be based on a financial motivation. Large corporate often have very strong sales teams. By buying a smaller, complementary company, the large corporate can sell more products through its existing sales team to its customer base. Other times, acquisitions are defensive. By acquiring a team, a large corporate can block a competitor from entering a market and posing a new competitive threat. The business owner must likely seek approval from the management team and the board. This person will present the business case to both of those groups in search of near-unanimous support.  When the business owner champions the acquisition to the management team and the board, they will commit to certain milestones that justify the acquisition. Successful acquisitions attain or exceed those milestones. Unsuccessful acquisitions don’t. The risk and uncertainty in attaining those milestones are a key part of the business owner’s calculus and psyche when deciding to advocate a transaction. I’ve written before about the importance of selling promotions to your customer. This is equally true when selling a business. Consequently, a startup must equip its internal business champion with the data and the story to justify the acquisition. A startup should strive to understand the rationale behind a potential merger and the buyer’s perceived risks - for each buyer because these will vary across potential acquirers. With that information, the startup should be in a position to maximize the chance of success.

Michael Porter wrote the seminal book on strategy in the early 1980s. Called Competitive Strategy, I think it should be required for anyone starting a company. Strategy is a seemingly murky amorphous intangible concept, but Porter brilliantly prescribes the five questions strategy should answer. What are the answers for your business? What is your distinctive value proposition? This distinctive value proposition comprises three key parts. Which customers will you serve? Which needs of those customers will you fulfill better than the competition? How will you position and price your proposition (premium/commodity)?  This can be best answered by relative pricing . Amazon’s consumer value proposition is simple: the most selection at the best prices delivered fastest to all internet consumers in the US. How do you tailor the value chain to suit your company? Porter  wrote about two different types of value chains: internal value chains and external ones. In this case, he is talking about the internal one.  As Joan Magretta writes in Understanding Michael Porter , “The essence of strategy and competitive advantage lies in the activities, and choosing to perform activities differently or to perform different activities from those of rivals.”  This is what Porter means by tailoring the value chain to suit your company’s strategy: picking the internal activities that will differentiate it. Amazon has focused on building the single best supply chain, optimizing logistics and operations, to deliver the customer experience they value. What trade-offs does your business offer to differentiate itself from competitors? Every strategy has a trade-off. A startup trades speed of execution through focus to win in a market. An incumbent trades greater capitalization, reach and assets for speed. In the beginning, Amazon sold only books, only online. This decision limited the total addressable market and created additional friction in the checkout process because of the shipping latency. But, Amazon traded these disadvantages for capital efficiency. Amazon did not need to open retail stores and bear those operating costs. In addition,  this decision enabled Amazon to optimize their warehouses for shipping rather than retail distribution. How strong is the value proposition across the value chain? This is a nuanced question that tries to get at the leverage the strategy creates in the business. In other words, does the new value proposition and the trade offs made within the businesses operations suddenly create new market opportunity and competitive advantage. In Amazon’s case, the answer is a resounding yes. The advantages of an online only store and the shipping focused operation system enabled the company to launch additional categories quickly. In addition, the centralized value chain absorbed fixed costs as more products were shipped through it, increasing operational efficiency, and gross margins. How does your strategy endure over time? If market conditions change, does your strategy survive? Bezos insulated Amazon’s strategy from the fickleness of the consumer by promising them three things they would always want: more, faster, cheaper. Those three truths aren’t changing anytime soon. These questions are not easily answered. They require a fair amount of introspection and deep thought. But the exercises well worth it to ensure that all of the time, money, energy and sweat is directed in the right place to create an enduring business.

A friend died this week. It’s the first time I’ve lost a friend of a similar age. I don’t often see the fragility of life first hand, but this is one of those moments. I’ve felt many different emotions after I received the news: despair, grief, fear. The one I’m currently experiencing, though, is gratitude. And I hope that’s the feeling that persists. You will be missed, my friend.

One typical Friday morning in 2004, I walked into a government building and headed to work. I was a junior Java engineer and part of a hired team building an internal system for a government agency. We were a few days behind on schedule, and a technical issue arose. During the morning team meeting, we made a plan to refactor a small key part of the codebase - an effort that should have taken just the morning. And I made a classic mistake. I was tasked with rewriting one file that other parts of the program relied on. As I started to change this file, I saw ways in which other related files could be improved. And then other functions that could be optimized. Pretty soon it was midnight Sunday and I was quite deep in the rabbit hole. If I had wanted to change the oil of the car, I now found myself having completely dismantled the engine. The oil filter lodged in the engine block and cylinder head gaskets commingled with timing belts. The program wouldn’t compile - didn’t work at all. At about 2am, I deleted all the changes I had made over the past 72 hours, and went back to the original library. I spent 45 minutes rewriting that file and slept for a few hours before returning to work, exhausted and defeated. My beleaguered ambition to rewrite a big chunk of the codebase that weekend isn’t uncommon, as I learned later and have seen in several companies. In fact, these efforts occur a much larger scale when companies decide to migrate to the latest front end framework or infrastructure management technology. These large refactoring efforts can take months or sometimes years. All the while, product innovation stalls. For a startup, whose competitive advantage is speed, this innovation hiatus has an enormous and unquantifiable cost. In the worst cases, it can kill the company. So, when is embarking on a large refactoring worth it for software companies? When the technology limits growth and revenue. That’s my heuristic. Refactoring makes sense when a new feature or product for which customers will pay cannot be built without it. Refactoring is a worthwhile investment when customers will churn. Refactoring is like any other product and engineering initiative: it must be prioritized relative to the future revenue contribution to the business. Revenue contributions for future products can be difficult to estimate. But in many cases, the answer is obvious. Even if my refactoring efforts had succeeded and I had optimized all those Java libraries, none of it would have contributed to a happier customer or more revenue. It would have been code poetry, which is a wonderful thing, but not a priority for a fast-moving startup.

In the Wide Lens , Dartmouth Entrepreneurship professor Ron Adner explores the risks associated with innovation. Execution risk is the obvious one. 	Then there’s co-innovation risk, what might be called chained technology risk. For example, to build a new ML focused microchip, a startup relies on the chip fabrication plant to develop 7nm equipment .  But the most interesting of the three is Adoption Chain Risk. Adoption Chain Risk is “the extent to which partners will need to adopt your innovation before end consumers have a chance to assess the full value proposition.” Adoption Chain Risk applies the idea of a supply chain to innovation. A startup’s supply chain includes all the partners who supply essential components to a product. Those can be upstream of the company: the necessary technologies to offer a SaaS service like Amazon’s S3 or EC2. They can be downstream of the company: partners who market, sell or service software perhaps a TrendMicro. Or they can be somewhere in the middle: a customer who provides access to their data to develop some machine learning system like a LinkedIn user or a Infer customer. Adner points to many examples in the book of teams within companies who execute flawlessly on product delivery, but ultimately fail to commercialize their innovation because of oversights convincing the rest of the adoption chain. Michelin developed a PAX tire that resists puncture much better than standard tires. The initial launch enticed Mercedes Benz to install PAX tires on the top-of-the-line S class, and soon other carmakers followed. But these required new machines and training to repair after a puncture. Mechanics across the world didn’t see the value of investing in new equipment or training, and PAX tires ultimately failed as a business unit. The book underscores the difference between the innovator’s perception of the benefits, compared to the customer. While the innovator sees the total benefit of their solution, the customer consider the relative benefit of the new solution compared to the old one, and also the hidden costs of switching. Whenever a buyer decides to adopt new software, there’s an activation energy they must invest to transition. Inertia is one of the biggest blockers in sales , especially when the perceived benefit of the new solution isn’t irrefutable. But this inertia doesn’t exist just for the customer. Rather, it’s there for every member of the downstream supply chain (channels, customers supplying data). App stores prefer to feature applications whose value proposition is strong. Resellers and go-to-market partners prefer to resell products that resonate with the customer base. Customers prefer to provide their data to vendors who will truly create new value with their data. By mapping the supply chain, writing down the value proposition for each stakeholder wihin in, and validating that assumption, you can prevent the issues that plagued the many businesses Adler highlights in The Wide Lens.

In software, we’ve moved from a world where a customer buys a piece of software to run on their own infrastructure, to a world where a customer pays a vendor to run software on the vendor’s infrastructure. With machine learning, we may see another evolution of this. Machine learning startups create models based on data provided by customers. Should customers be compensated for their contribution? Unlike the first wave of SaaS software, machine learning startups benefit from the data their customers share with them. Many times, machine learning startups create one global machine learning model that is used across the customer base. Each marginal customer provides additional data that refines the model. Today, I could argue customers contribute their data altruistically. Another might argue the customer pays for the right to contribute their data and benefit from the software startup’s models. A third might argue that the customer should actually benefit economically from this contribution. Which is the right viewpoint? Which is the viewpoint that will ultimately govern the customer/vendor relationships in SaaS? Online advertising serves as a potential model for how the machine learning software as a service ecosystem might evolve. In the 2000s, Google and others built global machine learning models for ad targeting across websites. Some customers balked at the idea of contributing their data to benefit their competitors. But there wasn’t a simple way to isolate individual customer data and its benefit to the global targeting. So you either ran Google ads or you didn’t. As ecosystem evolved, website publishers sought to monetize the data they were providing. This created an opportunity for companies like BlueKai and others to build a Data Management Platform, which aggregated all the publishers’ first party data and allow them to sell their data on a marketplace.  And that initiative met some success. However, many of these publishers soon realized that they benefited more from leveraging their own data directly to improve their own monetization efforts. Rather than selling their data to third parties, they focused on building competitive advantage through their own data. To summarize, publisher still contribute their data to global advertising networks to improve performance for everyone. But they have doubled down on extracting unique value for themselves from their first party data. I believe that the SaaS ecosystem will evolve similarly. Startups and incumbents alike focus on a few core areas of competitive differentiation. In those areas,  these businesses will focus on first party data, limit the amount of data sharing with competition, and likely build models in-house to maximize their advantage. For non-strategic areas, these businesses will pay to use ML-based SaaS. And they will be very unlikely to demand a royalty for data rights usage, because the marginal revenue from such an arrangements simply isn’t meaningful for many of them. It also would challenge the business model of the SaaS startup. In other words, the revenue from data royalties is worth less than the value of an intelligent human resources information system or customer relationship management system or customer support system. The universe of buyers would rather see a successful machine learning SaaS company than generate $15-100k annually in data-royalty revenue.

Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods is notable for many reasons. Of course, there’s the magnitude $13.7B. The second is the shockwaves reverberating through the grocery industry. Costco fell 10% and Kroger almost 25% on the news. Third, the acquisition underscores the importance of physical retail even to the largest American ecommerce giant. Those are all remarkable in their own right. However, the most interesting part of this acquisition is that it marks the current apotheosis of technology’s impact in the broader economy. In the last 18 months, non-traditional tech acquirers changed the M&A landscape for startups. Walmart, Unilever, GM, Ford spent billions of dollars collectively to acquire Jet, Bonobos, Dollar Shave Club, Cruise, and Chariot. That’s all fine and expected. But, Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods is the reverse: a leading technology company buying a leader of a traditional industry. That might not seem like an important distinction, but it is. Five of the top ten most valuable companies in America are technology companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook. Exxon, Berkshire Hathaway, GE, JPMC and Johnson & Johnson fill out the list. The more than $250B on their collective balance sheets implies very few acquisition targets are out of their reach. And if the ripples from the Amazon/Whole Foods merger are any indication, technology initiated M&A of traditional industries has the power to upend the status quo. How would the world change if Apple bought Tesla to pursue the automotive industry? Or if Facebook bought Citibank to create the next generation mobile bank serving a billion people? Tack on a major global mobile phone carrier, and the social network might replicate M-Pesa’s or WeChat’s social success globally. Would Google acquire Salesforce, and in one fell swoop, add another $8B in annual revenue, add an enormous enterprise salesforce, and develop a global leading software business? Salesforce might be less of a traditional business, but the impact to the software world would be just as disruptive. Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods could be the first of several major transactions in which leading technology companies redefine traditional industries by leveraging their near-infinite balance sheets and injecting rapidly advancing technologies or unique distribution that incumbents simply can’t match. If the trend does continue, these major acquisitions will create quite a bit of volatility and uncertainty - great conditions for fast-moving startups to develop and seize the new opportunities that will inevitably crop up to compete with tech/traditional conglomerates.

I’ve been reading Fred Kofman’s book, Conscious Business. Written in 2006, the book summarizes Kofman’s experiences as a management consultant to some of the great leaders in technology and other industries. In the book, Kofman lists 12 questions Gallup used to identify great managers in one of the largest management surveys conducted. As I read this list of 12 questions, I started answering them for each of the different roles I’ve had. When I worked for great managers and answered the questions, I found I answered yes to almost all of them. The converse is also true. This list incorporates questions about communication clarity, mission, shared values, respect, community and teamwork. Do I know what is expected of me at work? Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right? At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day? In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for doing good work? Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person? Is there someone at work who encourages my development? At work, do my opinions seem to count? Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel my job is important? Are my co-workers committed to doing high-quality work? Do I have a best friend at work? In the last six months, has someone at work talked to me about my progress? This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow? Running through this list as a manager with each report might be a great way to structure a one-on-one, especially those deeper conversations about career progression, employee satisfaction and a person’s place within an organization.

Earlier this week, I spoke at 2U’s annual employee conference. Redpoint partnered with 2U at the Series A, and they are now a $2B publicly traded education company that powers online degree programs for Georgetown, USC, Syracuse, Berkeley, and Yale, among others. It was an inspirational moment for me because I observed the intense power of developing strong company culture. I’ve never read the list of core company values or spoken to the executive team about them. But I’m quite confident that I could enumerate at least five of them. Having fun. I arrived at the green room about 2 hours before my allotted time to speak. The executive team also congregated there. After about 15 minutes, one of the executives started playing iconic 70s and 80s music, belting the melodies out and inviting others to join. Trust and Transparency. The entire company performed a personality assessment and the management team shared their results before the entire company on the stage. Such transparency creates trust and understanding, the cornerstones of great working relationships. Teamwork. In a moment of downtime, one of the executives began a conversation on a key strategic question for the business. I watched as she asked each of the other members in turn for their opinion, building consensus and considering different viewpoints. Supportive environment. As I was rehearsing my slides, I kept tripping on the one with the photograph of Mahatma Gandhi. Embedded in a section on decision making fallacies, this was the anchoring bias slide. I was supposed to say, “If I were to ask you if Gandhi was more than 114 years old when he died, your estimate of his age at his death would be much higher than if I changed the age to 35.” But I couldn’t remember that line. I tried several times, and finally abandoned it, and the audience couldn’t have been warmer, clapping and laughing with me as I bumbled onto the next topic. Investing in people. As a few of the executives shared with me, culture is a key part of the company and this annual meeting is a key part of that strategy. Culture is managing at scale. Culture starts at the top, and must be a key priority for the executive team. As Jeff Bezos said in 2014, “My main job today: I work hard at helping to maintain the culture.” It’s the way companies like 2U scale their teams across thousands of people. By inculcating values, management teams are able to influence decisions, whether hiring decisions, customer engagement decisions or product decisions. Values reaffirm attitudes, which create beliefs and create customs/influence actions. It was wonderful to see observe how a strong a culture the team at 2U have developed, and how universal their values are shared. I’m certain the culture has been a critical part of the company’s continuing success.

When I analyzed the SaaS fundraising market in 2016 , three trends emerged. The number of SaaS companies raising rounds had stalled, while the total number of dollars plateaued. Meanwhile, round sizes swelled. In other words, there was a concentration of capital in an increasingly small number of names. A year later,  those trends have continued to converge, and SaaS valuations  have resurged, reaching their highs of the 2014-2015 boom. The chart above shows a time series analysis of series A, series B, series C, and seed rounds over the last seven years. Mean round sizes are drawn in red, and medians in blue. Across all rounds, both lines are up into the right, despite some volatility in 2016. Comparing 2017 averages to seven year highs, we observe Series A, Series B, and Series Seed round sizes are effectively at their all-time highs, ignoring some minor differences. Assuming investors purchase the same ownership stake for their investments in each of these rounds, this data implies the market is paying premium valuations again for SaaS companies. The only exception is in the Series C. But if the trendline in the previous chart is any indication, this round will also achieve seven-year highs in the near future. In contrast to these seemingly monotonic increases in round sizes, the total amount of SaaS fundraising peaked in 2015 at $4.2 billion. In 2016, venture capitalists reduced their investment in staff companies by 1/3, falling to $2.8 billion from $4.2 billion. If the first six months of 2017 are any indication, then 2017 should be roughly similar to 2016 and 2014 in terms of total dollars raised by SaaS startups in seed rounds through Series C. However, the number of SaaS companies raising capital continues to decline. About halfway through the year, fewer than 200 staff companies have raised rounds. Should the current trend continue, 2017 would see the fewest number of rounds since 2012, and a 45% reduction from 2014 high. Ultimately, the concentration of large amounts of venture capital in this never small number of startups is pushing prices and their multiples higher. With median round sizes at their all-time highs, and a reduction in the number of software companies raising, this trend seems unlikely to change in the near future. In 2017, SaaS companies seeking venture capital will find plenty of it if they can convince investors of their story.

I am most grateful for my work experiences that were apprenticeships. Whether it was Philip who taught me how to write a proper Java function (10 lines or less), or Kim and Scott who are great managers, or the partners at Redpoint who invested a huge amount of time to educate me, those collections of experiences have taught me far more than I could’ve expected. Worklife is nuanced. Reading a blog article here or in HBR article there, a business book or an academic paper only goes so far because these summaries of knowledge lack one key ingredient. Judgment. Watching someone else exercise their judgment, explain and rationalize their decisions, and then draw your own conclusions and inferences from the same sets of data, with similar emotions and stresses. That experience is the invaluable part of being an apprentice. This is the incommunicable part of knowledge. As startups grow, their founding teams will inevitably face questions of judgment. Many times, the questions that arise will be entirely novel. It could be as simple as how do I interview my first head of product? What questions do you ask? How do you determine if someone is a good cultural fit? How you understand if someone shares the work ethic and values? The technical questions of whether someone can write an SQL query or develop an ideal customer profile are self-evident. But these other questions require judgment to assess. When I say the word apprenticeship, I suspect I conjure an image of a young Raphael working for years at the behest of Perugino, a master, in some tight room of an Umbrian guild. But apprenticeship isn’t nearly as formal or as lengthy in Silicon Valley as the Renaissance. In fact, we’ve formalized many of these types of knowledge transfer in the form of formal advisors, angel investors, management coaches, mentors, and board members. Sometimes apprenticeship can be as simple as asking a senior executive to interview a few VP level candidates on your behalf and observing, learning from the process, and starting the process of developing judgement. Figuring out how to become an apprentice time and again is a key to developing great judgement. And even better if you’re willing to invest the time to take on an apprentice.

The New Zealand All Blacks are the most successful athletic team perhaps of all time. A rugby outfit whose name originates from the solid black uniforms, they have won 79% of their international matches spanning 68 years . James Kerr followed the All Blacks, interviewed them and distilled his learnings into a book, Legacy. Kerr organizes the book into 15 life lessons, three of which stood out to me. Humility is the first. After each match, the All Blacks, among the greatest rugby players in the world, sweep up after themselves. They clean up their locker room after all the celebration of a victory or the disappointment of defeat. Aggregation of marginal gains is the second. This idea reminded me of two equations. 1.01^365 = 37.8 0.99^365 = 0.03 A one percent improvement each day for a year creates a huge change. A one percent decrease in performance asymptotes to zero really quickly. Strive to improve each day just a little bit more. Plant trees you’ll never see is the third, and my favorite. Said in other way, invest in long-term projects whose success you won’t see realized because they are the right thing for the organization. This idea is my favorite because that’s how teams create legacy. The All Blacks say it another way: leave the jersey better than how you found it. This idea links the day-to-day improvements to the very long term ambitions of an organization. Something which are inextricably intertwined but easy to forget in the repetition of the daily grind. Thanks, Neil, for sending this great book to me.

What could be more natural than a marketer selling a product to other marketers? Or an engineer pushing a new devops tool to other developers? Or a customer success person pitching CS tools? After all, they both speak the same language, come from the same domain, will develop trust quickly. Consequently, they will sell faster and more efficiently. This might seem like a very logical argument for differentiating on sales processes, but it’s a fallacy. Why doesn’t this strategy work? First, it presumes that the most valuable skill set in sales is building rapport. Trust is critical. You won’t buy a product from someone you don’t trust or respect, or who doesn’t understand your challenges. However, trust-building skills are insufficient to be a great salesperson. Great salespeople understand how to manage a sales process and the five key people in a sales process . They know how to structure contracts to navigate procurement. Great account executives understand where to spend their time to maximize their success. Second, this fallacy assumes a company cannot train a salesperson to be knowledgeable enough about a category to develop rapport - or do that at scale. Page through the resumes of account executives at some of the world’s largest software companies and you’ll see most of them are career SDRs and account executives. In fact, startups must teach everyone in the company to speak effectively to customers. This is just as critical for sales as customer support as recruiting as press and marketing. Third, “hiring a role to sell strategy” creates scaling challenges. How many marketers are currently looking to move into sales right now? The universe of available account executives dwarfs the meager number of career-changing marketers. It’s possible to build a pipeline of marketers, but the recruiting process will be slow. Imagine meeting an engineer or a product manager to convince them to become a sales-person. “We’d like to hire you as an account executive. We’ll cut your salary in half, give you the other half in commission, if and only if you sell a certain number of customers. You’ll have a few months to learn on the job and then it’s sink or swim.” Fourth, the last point highlights the differences in motivation between sales organizations and others. Many salespeople prefer the idea of taking home a share of their commissions. There’s more risk, but there’s much more reward than a salaried position. This simple dynamic ensures that sales compensation plans manage sales teams effectively, by rewarding key sales behavior with multipliers and kickers. To first order, the idea of hiring a role to sell might seem logical. But the challenges of scaling and managing a role sales team outweigh the ostensible advantages.

We’ve entered an era when computers can understand speech, computers can synthesize speech, computers can develop music, author encryption algorithms, create novel art, respond to customer support questions, and even generate new summaries and reports from data. Increasingly, humans will struggle to distinguish between computer-generated and human generated. Consequently, here’s an opportunity for startups to lead, not just technologically, but more broadly. DT is a creative digital agency business based in Australia that developed a prototype that distinguishes between human speech and synthetic speech. Shaped like a hearing aid, the Anti AI AI chills the listener behind the ear using a Peltier device when the onboard TensorFlow model detects computer-generated speech. It’s one of undoubtedly many technologies which will use one machine learning model to detect another machine learning model. This idea is not new. In the financial world, understanding the trading patterns of high frequency algorithms can generate millions of dollars in profits. Researchers deploy algorithms to reverse engineer those trading patterns. Security systems have been doing this for decades. Security researchers  develop software to search for the signatures left behind by automated exploitation programs. DT’s clever prototype is one type of response. Develop defensive detection tools to distinguish deception. And the course, those technologies will be critically important. But I’m hopeful that many machine learning startups who develop novel technologies will also adopt ethics statements. Statements of ethics outline how a company intends to use a particular technology: which uses they deem valid and which they view negatively. Not just words, ethics should also govern the internal operation of the startup, and form part of the key values of the business. Google’s “Don’t be Evil” mantra encapsulated this notion of ethics for me when I worked there. Given all the data, all the computational power, all the human capital the business had amassed, there were many different  opportunities to generate revenue in unsavory ways. “Don’t be evil” and “focus on the user and all else will follow” were two oft-repeated aphorisms in Google’s product management vernacular and they were part of the executives’ drumbeat. These sayings influenced the way we built products and provided simple mnemonics for Google’s values. In addition to voluntary internal controls, external controls are likely to be written into law. Already the EU has instituted data protection legislation that also implement some notion of a right of explanation. The EU believes citizens have a right to understand why an algorithm categorized the citizen a particular way. I don’t know if these types of laws will come to the US, but for any company doing business in Europe, they cannot be ignored. All these wonderful new tools and technologies will provide us novel ways to improve our lives. But like any tool, we have to use them properly and responsibly. Defining corporate ethics around these novel technologies is an important part of establishing a startup’s role in the ecosystem and presents an opportunity for thought leadership in the space.

When I was taught Michael Porter’s value chain analysis , I learned to analyze at the industry level. A beer supplier sells to wholesaler sells to distributor sales to retailers sells to customer. But as I went back last night and reread Porter’s Competitive Strategy, I was surprised to learn that Porter’s intended value chain analysis to be used also at the business unit and at the company level. The more interesting of the two for startups is the company level. A value chain analysis of the company level aims to determine the primary focus/competitive advantage of each company within a space. In order to be successful, startups have to be good at many things. But most of the time, they are exceptional at one thing. The startup often inherits this exceptional characteristic from one or more of the founders. A relentless focus on product excellence (Apple). A unique selling strategy (Salesforce). Best in class and proprietary technology (Google). Determining how to compete is a critical part of developing a startup idea . In most software categories,  incumbents exist and for start up to win share, the company must wrest budget of way from incumbents. How to do that best? Use startup judo . The first tenet of judo is never to oppose strength with strength. The second is to maximize leverage. To do that, a startup must understand where opponents are strong, and where they are weak. By attacking the weak points and matching them to customer needs, a startup creates maximum leverage. The chart above is a value chain analysis at the company level for the cloud computing ecosystem. I have listed the four major players: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Digital Ocean. The columns across the top enumerate the key activities of technology companies. In the red boxes, I’ve highlighted the key strength of each of the competitors. Amazon released more than 1500 products last year. Their competitive advantage is speed and breadth. By launching many different products, they can quickly understand which initiatives have strong market pull then double down on those. Plus, by maximizing their product footprint, they have captured a majority of the market. Microsoft has signed hundreds if not thousands of customers to enterprise license agreements. These ELAs enable customers to buy Microsoft products without having to go through procurement, greasing the sales process. The Azure team has built products to leverage that strength. A F500 can simply decide to replicate a local SQL Server instance to cloud Azure instance with a few clicks, and they instantly become a Microsoft Cloud customer. From its earliest days, Google has spared no expense to develop the best infrastructure in the world. Google’s cloud is arguably the most sophisticated and best built cloud. In the market, Google differentiates by offering these public infrastructure services, which have made them so successful, to everyone else. Whether it’s the artificial intelligence offering, the highly scalable big query product, or the globally distributed transactional database Spanner, each of these products are best in class. Up and comer Digital Ocean meanwhile competes through support and marketing, which are almost synonymous in the developer world. Digital Ocean has developed the best documentation for engineers using cloud platforms. This reduces the friction of signing up, minimizes the cost of customer acquisition, and fills the funnel. Each of these companies are successful by choosing a competitive strength that fits their unique assets. To start a cloud company today whose differentiator is better technology would be to embark on a very difficult journey. How is an early-stage company to compete with Google’s balance sheet and thousands of engineers? Porter’s value chain analysis is useful at many different levels. But when starting a company and trying to determine its strategy, the value chain analysis at the company level can be an insightful tool to maximize an early stage company’s leverage and ultimate success.

In January 2010, Andrew Parker wrote a post called the Spawn of Craigslist.  Andrew identified companies that had built businesses by unbundling Craigslist. The vacation rentals link gave rise to AirBnB and HomeAway. Etsy dominated the arts and crafts for sale. This same unbundling is occurring to Excel. Microsoft Office has more than 1 billion users globally. Assuming a 33% penetration of Excel, that’s a user population 300M users.  Like Craigslist in the consumer world,  Excel became the tool for nearly everyone to get stuff done at work. Need to calculate? Excel. How about a task list? Excel. How about a lightweight CRM to manage customers?  Financial model? Waterfall chart for project management? Simple dashboarding/charting tool? Data exchange format between a supplier and a buyer?  Light ETL tool for moving data around an organization. The list goes on and on. For millions of people, Excel is the first exposure to the power of a computer to manipulate data, calculate, and share the results. Excel’s key advantage is its product design. Excel enables simple progressive discovery. A user’s first experience is typically a quick calculation. Then perhaps adding a few rows, then a few worksheets. But pretty soon, a procurement person might be managing different quotes to buy desks. And then, they might ask how they could automate analysis in which case the could use VBA, Excel’s programming language. Then there’s the entire function library, a sophisticated data and analysis toolkit, the charting. Excel has done a phenomenal job educating hundreds of millions of people about the power of software.  Startups are taking advantage of this newly data-literate user base and carving out individual applications, replacing Excel with dedicated workflow that’s optimized for a particular function. This unbundling of Excel occurs primarily within medium business portion of the SMB segment. After a company reaches a particular scale, teams grow and specialize, collaboration becomes more important, and so does control. This evolution in a company’s needs creates an opportunity for dedicated workflow software to replace former Excel use cases. These startups benefit from fast sales cycles because the benefits of a dedicated tool over Excel are clear and quantifiable. At some point, the Excel workflow becomes unwieldy and burdensome, and the software buyer feels the pain every day. So if a new company comes calling with a tool to solve that workflow issue, the buyer is ready, educated and motivated to relay the 16 digits on their credit card to solve the problem. Consequently, these companies lend themselves well to inside sales models with very short sales cycles. I wish there were a list of all the Excel use cases so I could create a parallel graphic to Andrew’s, but unfortunately there is none. Nevertheless, the universe of opportunities for unbundling Excel is enormous, and a big trend in workflow software.

In Bias Against Creativity , a team of researchers at Cornell discuss the bias against creativity they revealed in their study. Originally published in 2010, the article resurfaced yesterday on Hacker News. It raises the question of how to evaluate creative ideas and how to engender internal incentives to support creativity. From the Cornell paper: People often reject creative ideas even when espousing creativity as a desired goal. To explain this paradox, we propose that people can hold a bias against creativity that is not necessarily overt, and which is activated when people experience a motivation to reduce uncertainty. Theoretically we all support the notion of creative ideas. But, in practice, creative ideas aren’t free. The cost of failure is real, both in terms of capital outlay for an experiment that may not work. Perhaps more importantly, a manager who supports a creative idea bears some personal career risk. Presented with a novel idea and a less risky option whose execution is similar to the status quo, inertia often prevails. As decision-makers, we calculate an implicit expected value to determine which option begets a greater likelihood of career advancement . Jessica Olien at Slate wrote about this topic and identified Barry Staw, a researcher at Berkeley, who contributed a chapter to a book on creativity, titled “No One Wants Creativity” : Most people fall short of the creative ideal. They are satisficers rather than searchers for the optimal or desired solution… and unless they are held accountable for their decision-making strategies, they tend to find the easy way out—either by not engaging in very careful thinking or by modeling the choices on the preferences of those who will be evaluating them. Staw has five recommendations on promoting creativity in business: Hire people who’s skills aren’t precise matches for the needs of the company. Encourage employees not to listen blindly to corporate policy and conventional wisdom; not all to speak with the same voice. Those in power should go as far as possible to encourage active opposition to ideas. (Similar to Drucker’s obligation to dissent ). Optimize for adaptiveness. Have extra labor capacity and explore side projects. (How many creative companies started or were reinvigorated by side projects? Twitter and Slack are two that immediately come to mind). Lead rather than follow. Take risks. These aren’t easy things to do. It requires a huge amount of confidence in the team and a culture that’s supportive of risk-taking. Bezos said it well: We are willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time. That has to be true at every level of the company to maximize creativity.

As the number of SaaS applications has exploded, the SaaS ecosystem is responding to data fragmentation with middleware. This isn’t the middleware of the early 2000s, which was focused on helping developers build software. This is middleware that is focused on helping end-users unify data from the vast numbers of data repositories now existent. Ten years ago, sales teams captured basic data on customers and prospects. Names, addresses, budget, time frame. All of it collected over the phone. Today, sophisticated operations teams manage lead lists numbering in the millions, enrich those lists with data providers, and integrate marketing, product, and external data to amalgamate a rich profile of prospects. All in effort to maximize sales efficiency and reduce sale cycles. Before you contact a potential lead, you can know what infrastructure they run, when the contract of a competing product expires, how may times they visited your website, which creative they respond to, which social media channels they are active on and so on. Pretty soon, you’ll have their social security number via API and know the brand of their underwear. As a movement forms around customer operations ,  integrating this data across the 20 or 40 tools that a go to market organization might use is critical. Mapping data from customer success experience back to marketing campaigns improves advertising performance. But, it would be a mistake to say that this type of data fragmentation exists only for the go-to-market organization of the company. Finance teams are increasingly using more software, everything from purchase order management to sales forecasting to financial planning and analysis to accounts payable optimization. Product teams synthesize data from product usage, content marketing, engineering, infrastructure. Same for security. And HR/recruiting. Analysts forecasting the future and data scientists building data productS. And so on. In the past, the success of point solutions have triggered M&A waves. The incumbents acquire successful point solutions and combine them with an existing platform, to capture more revenue and reinforce their competitive advantage. But in this era, consolidation isn’t happening as quickly as operators would like. How can it?  We’ve seen a more than 7X explosion the number of tools being sold to sales and marketing teams in the last 3-4 years. The market demand exists for data centralization tools. Databases that unify information across domains, at opposite ends of the corporate spectrum. Combine marketing data with infrastructure performance to understand how website rendering speed influences conversion rates for an e-commerce merchant. And there will be several very large companies built serving the needs of these buyers. These are the new systems of record: the systems that amalgamate information from all other systems to provide a single view for a team or department.  They become the new systems of record because upon that data, teams can act, and they will likely respond to changes within trends using code. Insight -> API call -> Action. Machine learning is a key component of generating those insights. Data volumes exceed any human’s ability to process it, so machines will be responsible for finding anomalies or conditions that require human intervention. Server slowdown impacting Californian customers? Page an ops person, pull the recent log information and tee up the diagnostic workflow. A sales prospect has just visited the website 3x in the last hour? Kick off a retargeting campaign, an outbound email from an SDR and fire up an account based marketing site. That kind of coordination across teams who may not collaborate on a day-to-day basis is going to unlock a huge amount of productivity and effectiveness, which was has always been the process of being data-driven.

How much revenue do you want to book for your SaaS startup next quarter? And in 12 months?  It is one thing to put a number down on the financial plan. It’s another thing altogether to have the sales team staffed to close that amount of business. The bookings capacity of the business is the amount of business a sales team should book in a certain period. Bookings capacity is calculated as: Bookings_capacity = Σ AE_ramp_progress x AE_quota x AE_quota_attainment In other words, a startup’s booking capacity is equal to the ramp progress of an account executive multiplied by the AE’s quota, multiplied by the expected quota attainment, summed across all AEs. AEs take a certain amount of time to ramp into their role. They build a pipeline, learn the sales motion, and close a few accounts in the first few months. For inside reps, this ramp period is often 4-6 months. One common ramp scheme sees AEs tasked with 0%, 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of quota by month across the first six months. For field reps, the ramp period might be nine months. Quota attainment is the average quota attainment of the sales team as a whole. Most startups range in the 60-70% range, but the figure depends on how aggressive or conservative your projection might be. Quota capacity increases as the number of reps increase. The key point, though, is that a startup cannot instantly increase quota capacity. The six month ramp time adds latency. So does recruiting time. If a startup averages 90 days to hire an account executive, and 180 days to ramp, then $525k in bookings capacity has a 9 month lead time. ($750k quota at 70% attainment). But the AEs don’t operate in isolation. Returning to the idea of a fundamental unit of growth , a cross-functional team must be hired to support that bookings capacity comprising sales development, marketing and customer success. In addition, team leads and managers must also be staffed as the team grows. Adding in some buffer for inaccurate hiring, that half-a-million in bookings capacity must be planned for a year ahead of time. There’s a conundrum many teams will face in the earliest days of a company. If a handful of account executives perform well in the first quarter or two of sales, a critical question is raised. Do we have enough confidence in our sales execution ability to invest a million or two dollars in building out that team? Invest too soon, and the capital might be for nought. Invest too late, and the company may under-optimize its growth. Pipeline to quota ratio can be a helpful metric to inform this decision. A PQR greater than 5x suggests the team should be able to beat its numbers and that the AEs have sufficient leads. As you scale your SaaS startup, bookings capacity is an important metric for growth planning. To achieve next year’s numbers, you’ll likely need to hire today.

In January, I wrote The Hardest Round to Raise which argued Series B rounds would be the most challenging early stage round in 2017. Irrespective of the annual vicissitudes of the fundraising market, Series Bs are always the most challenging rounds to raise because they are in-between rounds. The Series B is the pimpled and gangly adolescent phase of startup evolution. If the aim of every round of venture funding is to prove a hypothesis - which I believe is true in Series Seed, A and B - then the Series B is the last milestone before proving cash is the business’ limiting factor . With seed money, founders test an idea to see if there is any potential of product/market fit. A seed investor evaluates many attributes of the company, but in the end is likely betting on the team and the dream. With Series A investment, founders productionize the software and prove that customers might pay for the software at small scale. The Series A investor extrapolates from a handful of data points that a company might grow quickly. At the time of the B, a small number of companies may have proven that thesis beyond doubt: either growing quickly enough to command a huge price (huge and unquestionable success) or proving the initial hypothesis isn’t viable (certain failure). But most companies will find themselves having proven only certain parts of the go-to-market, but not all. Series B companies may have some subset of key metrics in attractive ranges. They might have half of a management team hired. They might have some great customer success, but some churned, too. At this point, the business is too far evolved to simply sell the dream, but not far enough along to raise on the metrics. That’s the crux of the Series B. The company has one foot on either side of Geoffrey Moore’s chasm. Can the business deftly place ten toes on the far side? The fundraising pitch must focus on why the company’s momentum so far will make the leap inevitable . In these cases, confident storytelling is the keys. The best book I’ve read on the topic is Resonate . A great pitch inspires investors, recruits and the press to believe.

When building a SaaS product for salespeople, a startup’s price will inevitably be compared to Salesforce CRM’s cost of about $150 per seat . How expensive is this new product compared to Salesforce? In diligence calls, I often hear buyers say: one-half of Salesforce’s price seems expensive; one-third might seem more reasonable. This is the price anchoring effect in the real world. This is true beyond sales products. For example, a basic server on Amazon costs about $600 per year . Server monitoring companies cost about roughly 30-50%. Relative pricing comparisons are among the most common method of price rationalization. This is why relative pricing questions are so effective when establishing product-market fit.  How much value does this new software provide relative to the value I generate from Salesforce? Or GSuite? Or Amazon’s EC2 and S3? Most of the time, new offerings distributed on platforms do not command a price premium over the platform. Software platforms are frequently the system of record, the database holding the key data assets of the department. That role is quite important. In contrast, the tools built on top extract some value from that data. Of course, there are exceptions. Inside Sales , which offers an inside sales acceleration platform including an integrated dialer, often generates $200 or more from a seat . But price anchoring based on platform pricing is the norm. What is the most you have paid for an app on the iOS App Store or Google Play? Maybe $10?  The average app price for iOS is $1.02 as of this writing. And less than 0.05% of applications charge more than $500. It would be ridiculous to see a Salesforce One mobile 10-pack annual subscription priced at $18,000 on the iOS store, wouldn’t it? At that price, it’s possible to buy with a credit card, but the price level is incongruous with its surroundings. It’s like leasing a new Ferrari at a dollar store. There’s an 18,000x difference in price between products. Talk about cognitive dissonance . I’ve been wondering whether the price anchoring effect applies to companies built on top of messaging platforms like Slack and Hipchat. At $7 and $2 per month per user respectively, these products are priced to grow uninhibited within enterprises. Will startups building products on top of the distribution platforms of each face pricing anchoring headwinds? I’m hopeful they will break the mold. I’m looking for additional counter-examples, companies command a greater price than their underlying software distribution platform.  I’m curious if there are patterns to be learned. If you’ve come across one, please write to me.

A founder emailed me last week to raise the question of whether performance pricing for SaaS companies is an effective technique. Performance pricing means explicitly pricing of product in terms of the customers’ revenue gained or cost reduced from its use. Conceptually, performance pricing is very rational. The buyer should be willing to pay between 10 to 15% of the revenue or cost savings for the use of the product. And as classical economics instructs us, this type of pricing mechanism optimally aligns the incentives of the buyer and the seller. But the reality is more nuanced. I was first exposed to performance pricing in the ad network world. In the late 2000s, hundreds of ad networks popped up each promising slightly better performance for their advertisers and their publishers. These are my observations from the evolution of that industry. Performance pricing is a challenging go to market strategy for one key reason: it cedes the startup’s pricing power to the customer. This has three key ramifications. First, each year when the contract comes up for renewal, the customer will ask, “What have you done for me this year?”  For a traditional SaaS product that charges by the seat, the product’s value resides in the product use. Salespeople can sell engagement, utility, insight. In contrast, performance pricing focuses the conversation to one thing. How much did the numbers improve? If the SaaS startup cannot continuously improve the performance for the customer, the customer is bound to churn. Second, performance pricing commodifies a category by reinforcing a single dominant purchasing parameter: performance. Vendors will all compete on percent improvement of the key metric. This is a very challenging sale, unless a SaaS startup has a substantially better product, and the ability to continuously maintain that lead. Otherwise, to win sales teams must discount, depressing pricing and leading to the ultimate commodification of the category. Third, sales teams lose leverage. If the only metric that matters is performance, then great account executives won’t be able to shine. Building a relationship won’t be valued in the category, or at least it’s not enough to overcome sub-par performance. Sales hiring, sales retention, and sales management will suffer. That’s why many companies who offer performance-based pricing prefer self sign up. Though performance pricing makes sense theoretically, it changes the power dynamics of a sales conversation, ceding all of the leverage to the customer. A startup will face greater churn rates, stiffer competition, tougher sales management, and ultimately commodification. The pricing mechanism itself reinforces that the product is a commodity. And who wants to be in that kind of market? Unless the explicit strategy of the start up is to somehow disrupt an existing commodity industry with a novel technology that performs much better than incumbents and couples it to a very efficient self sign-up customer acquisition strategy, performance pricing can be a tough go-to-market.

Five months into 2017 nine venture-backed technology companies have gone public compared to 14 in 2016. Four consumer companies and five enterprise companies have popped on average 29% since their IPO pricing. Only two, Carvana, an online used car dealer, and Netshoes, a Brazilian ecommerce company have traded down from their IPO pricing. The other seven have demonstrated the broad public investor demand for new offerings. B2B companies’ market cap totals $9.8B which is a third of B2C at $27B. Of course, Snap accounts for $26B of the $27B, or 96% of the consumer market cap. This bar chart characterizes a truism that differentiates consumer companies. There are fewer consumer companies of scale, but when they succeed, they can be monstruously large, and grow much faster than B2B companies. Snap is the youngest company of the cohort, founded in 2011. Most of these businesses are growing very quickly. Snap grew revenues by nearly 6x annually. The core B2B companies spanned 38%-87% annual growth. None of these businesses are profitable. The median company generated -28% net income margin, though NetShoes and Elevate Credit are both within sight of profitability at -4% and -9% net income margin. But if the trading patterns relative to IPO price are any guide, the market prefers growth to profits. Appian is likely the next venture backed technology IPO, coincidentally, my first employer after graduate school. Best wishes to the team there. The IPO market in 2017 seems to be very healthy and is on pace to be twice as active as last year.

Earlier this week, a founder asked whether the fundraising market suffered from seasonality. Are there more prosperous months to raise than others? That’s a simple question to answer - or so I thought. Ultimately, a dinosaur proved to me the answer is more nuanced. I plotted the mean round size of Series As from 2010-2016 in the bar chart above. You’ll notice, as I did, a spike in June and November. And a t-test shows these differences are statistically significant. The p-values for Jan/June and Jan/November are 0.002 and 0.0008. A very compelling figure to argue the difference in means is real. What logic might explain these surges? Perhaps venture capitalists aim to invest in 2 companies per year. Near the conclusion of every six month period, they clamor to meet that pace. Greater competition in June and November drives greater prices and larger round sizes. Or perhaps in June, investors are willing to credit the company with executing their plan for the rest of the year and price the business based on next year’s milestones? Also in December? I wondered if the same seasonality applies to Series Bs. Series B investors operate on a different schedule. They seem to vie more stridently to invest in startups in September, and relax most in March. Again, the p values for highest/lowest are compelling: 0.0017. The patterns are real - aren’t they? Let’s look at the data by year instead of aggregated across the six years. It’s chaotic. No clear pattern as far as I can see. Even if the statistics do claim a strong difference between round sizes by month. This exercise reminded me of a post written by Autodesk research: Same Stats, Different Graphs . In the graphic above, each of the different data sets depicted, the dinosaur, the star, the parallel lines, the ellipse, and so on, all generate the same summary statistics. The medians, means, standard deviations and even Pearson correlations equal each other to two decimal places. My statistical goose chase reinforced for me that blindly looking at summary statistics and p-values without contemplating the underlying data is the best way to draw spurious conclusions. There is no pattern to investment seasonality in the startups. Don’t let the summary statistics fool you.

Instead of raising an equity round, a startup might choose to borrow money - and for good reason. Venture debt dilutes founders much less than equity rounds. Low interest rates have increased the attractiveness of venture debt, because the cost to borrow is low. Venture debt is an attractive financial product. No wonder it has grown in popularity by 16x in the in the last six years. The chart above shows the amount of venture debt borrowed by US technology startups. Venture debt volumes have surpassed Series A and Series B dollars. I’ve also included equity crowdfunding, another alternative financing strategy, as a comparison. These venture debt rounds occur with some frequency. More than 500 venture debt rounds closed in 2014 and 2015. To put it into context, a venture debt round is more common than a Series B. The average venture debt transaction has ballooned from $4M to $18M over this six year period, besting Series B averages. But, there’s a wrinkle. The median venture debt round is a $1M loan over the same time frame - much smaller than a Series A or Series B. The median venture debt round hasn’t changed in size, even though the average has grown by more than 4x. If the typical early stage venture debt deal has remained the same, then where do all these lending dollars flock? Late stage startups. $250-$500M venture debt rounds have grown 6x in the past six years. In 2016, we saw the first $1B venture debt round. Lending at this scale is typically reserved for public companies. But as startups delay IPOs, lenders have provided lines of credit and term loans to these business while they are still private. Here are top 6 the biggest borrowers: Company Venture Debt Total, $M Uber 2750 Airbnb 1000 Avant 700 CAN Capital 650 Commonbond 575 Dropbox 500 Three of them are lenders themselves. One is a software company. And the remaining two are consumer services companies. The venture debt trend spans industry and business model. Curiously, there are no SaaS companies in this list. A bit further down, SurveyMonkey ranks 11th with a $350M Venture debt is an attractive way of financing a company’s operations because it’s less expensive and less dilutive than an equity round. As the amount of equity investing in Series As and Bs has exploded, venture borrowing has followed, and a new market has blossomed at the very latest stages.

My algorithm is better than yours. My algorithm performs better on the precision/recall tradeoffs. It surfaces fewer false positives. It converges to an answer faster. Perhaps it requires a bit less data. Those statements might all be true. But none of these advantages confer a competitive sales advantage in the market. They aren’t technology innovations leading to a go-to-market advantage . I first observed the use of large scale machine learning at Google. In the early and mid-aughts, the advertising ecosystem bloomed. Hundreds of ad networks vied for publisher ad impressions. Each one promised a better targeting system, new algorithms, unique data, better performance, more revenue. How did website publishers respond this rush of competition and overwhelming, undifferentiated marketing? They compared yield. At the beginning, a publisher might benchmark five or six different ad networks. Today, software exists to do this at scale. Supply side platforms select the optimal ad network for this ad unit on this page at precisely this time of day for this user. Rather than trusting an ad networks claims, a publisher verified them. In the advertising world, publishers bear almost no switching costs. If a new targeting mechanism arises, just click a button or change a line of Javascript. But in the SaaS world, switching costs are real. Customers must wait for contracts to expire. Or pay two competing vendors simultaneously. Cost prohibits A/B testing. So does training time. Unlike the advertising world where copious training data can be obtained inexpensively, SaaS products often require integration into customer systems. Customers must exercise patience. And the SaaS startup suffers slower sales cycles. In addition, internal dynamics create further friction to testing. Will the VP of Sales instruct her account executives to use two different CRM tools in parallel to see which is better? Hardly. The advantage of a better algorithm doesn’t appear in the sales process in SaaS for the reasons above. But better ML is still important. An algorithmic advantage accrues to the customer success teams, and reveals itself in the retention metrics. Once a company has committed to an ML-powered SaaS product, trained the system, tuned it to their liking, switching costs increase. The very same reasons above that slow sales cycles lengthen customer lifetimes. That’s the competitive advantage that many SaaS companies will benefit from. And if that’s the case, fast, expensive, and aggressive customer acquisition will become the dominant strategy in the early days of ML-disruption. The business that can buy the greatest number of annuities the fastest will win. Particularly, if those startups retain more of those recurring revenue dollars with superior math.

There are approximately 22 million trucks in the US. Many of these trucks run software to track the location of the vehicle, manage inventory, and comply with regulation. There are two SaaS companies operating at greater than $100M in ARR in the space and they illustrate one of the mantras on this blog: there are many different ways to build a SaaS company. After last week’s post, Is There a No Man’s Land in SaaS ACVs , a founder asked me to highlight some of the go to market strategies in different segments. The story behind Fleetmatics and Geotab illustrates the way two companies pursued the SMB logistics market in radically different ways, but built roughly similar sized businesses. Founded in 2004, Fleetmatics employs about 1150 employees. Based in Massachussetts, the company generated $320M in revenue in 2016. An unusual SaaS company, Fleetmatics generated profits: 6.5 and 14% in net income margin in 2015 and 2016. Fleetmatics sells software to owners of small fleets of lightweight trucks. Last year,  Verizon acquired Fleetmatics for $2.4B. The average contract value (ACV) of the business at IPO was $6788. How did a business at this price point scale, especially with an inside sales team? The company raised a total of $93M, which is far less than the typical SaaS public company. What’s more, they operate “below the minimum ACV to hire an inside sales team .” How did they do it? Fleetmatics financed its growth early on by generating cash. They borrowed a technique from enterprise selling reserved for the largest contracts. Multiyear deals. Although the average Fleetmatics customer pays $6800 per year, they sign a contract for three years.
Critically, Fleetmatics matches their sales tactics to their price point. Salespeople routinely call 100 customers per day and strive to close accounts in less than a week. Fast sales cycles reduce costs further. Three year commitments and nanoscale sales cycles transform the unit economics. And, upfront cash collections finance more inside sales hiring. A virtuous growth loop. Contrast Fleetmatics with a Geotab. Geotab addresses the same market as Fleetmatics. Geotab is a bootstrapped Canadian company that employs 300 employees and generated $110M in 2016 revenue. You read that right, Geotab employs one fifth the employees of Fleetmatics. Instead of selling directly to a customer, Geotab sells through channel partners. These software vendors customize the Geotab platform for customers. Geotab designed their platform to maximize the success of the channel. This symbiotic relationship enables Geotab to acquire customers and generate revenue with  greater capital efficiency than inside sales team. Instead of hiring many account executives, Geotab trains their resellers. Geotab has focused on building an open platform that matches its sales motion. Resellers thrive on customization - that’s how the channel adds value and justifies its existence in the value chain. Without the expense base of an inside sales team, Geotab requires less cash. They haven’t raised venture capital. The tradeoff is somewhat slower growth. Geotab was founded 4 years before Fleetmatics and is a bit smaller. Fleetmatics and Geotab have both reached terrific success as software companies. They both address the same market segment, but have approached it in radically different ways. The critical observation from this story is that each company matched its product and go to market strategy and stuck to it. Thanks for the inspiration, Abhinav!

A founder asked me recently if a dead zone in ACVs (average contract value) exist around the $10k price point. Yesterday, I listened to a podcast in which an executive asserted that infrastructure software priced lower than $250k in ACV threatens the viability of the company. What does the data show? I’ve plotted the distribution of ACV at IPO for all public software companies. There are no yawning gaps but a smooth progression from $87 to $780,000.  So there are successful companies at every price point. What about the typical market capitalization by price point? Do higher priced companies build bigger companies? The box plot above shows the market cap distribution in four roughly equally sized buckets. But the differences aren’t statistically significant. P values are 0.37 for the most extreme pair (<10 and 250k-1M). Note I’ve removed two outliers from the 50k bucket to make the chart easier to read. Perhaps looking at price point and buyer type might shed some light. Not really. Not much of a pattern in the point chart above. Looking at the success cases, we can conclude there’s existence proof of successful software companies at every price point. This analysis suffers from survivorship bias . We are analyzing only the companies who have succeeded. To answer the question fully, we would need to calculate the startup bankruptcy rate by ACV. Unfortunately, I don’t have that data set. Is there a dead zone in ACV? Large public companies have been built at every price point from $100 to $1M. It can be done and has been. Of course, a startup’s customer acquisition tactics, financing strategy, team and product must change to match the customer segment. So the better question that we can’t answer is: Which is the most risky price point to pursue as a SaaS company? That all hinges on the business’s unit economics .

At SaaStr earlier this year, I spoke about the huge potential of machine learning in SaaS. In that talk, I broke down some of the advances in ML that might be useful for software companies. In the discussion that ensued, I stressed the importance of not letting the technology obfuscate the value proposition of the software. Yes, ML is a huge step forward, but it’s not enough by itself. In fact, it likely isn’t the most challenging part of building a disruptive product. During a recent interview , Salesforce Chief Scientist Richard Socher spoke about the importance of workflows. There are three key phases of enterprise A.I. rollout: data, algorithms, and workflows…you have to be very careful to think about how to empower users and customers with your A.I. features. This is very complex but very specific. Workflow integration for sales processes is very different from those for self-driving cars. Of the three, workflows are the hardest. Only by nailing the workflow will a user grant you the time and permission to wow them with machine learning. Designing software that fits a user workflow is difficult. Better workflow is the hallmark of great software. Achieving it requires studying, researching, and distilling the way users work today. Some founders write software to solve their own problems, and understand the existing workflow from experience. Other founders interview hundreds of potential users and customers before writing code. A smaller group have great instincts. There are many ways. ML can improve the workflow by reducing data entry time (RelateIQ), improving efficiency (Infer), providing novel insight (Chorus), among many other use cases. But the challenge is always the same. How can software improve a current workflow to such an extent that a user is willing to stop their current workflow and learn a new one? The product’s value proposition must overwhelm the user’s inertia to keep working the same way. Machine learning enables startups to inject a new type of magic to their product. In every great product, there’s a bit of magic . But it’s the workflow that keeps the users coming back.

After a startup establishes product market fit, scaling demand generation becomes the the next major challenge. Doubling or tripling ARR each year for several consecutive years is not easy. The best marketers create a demand generation portfolio. There are four axes to measure this portfolio: scale of investment, sophistication, breadth and potential. At the outset, a startup may rely on a single channel of customer acquisition. But over time, in order to achieve larger and larger bookings, the company must diversify. Diversification prevents channel saturation risk. As spend in one channel grows, the cost of customer acquisition rises to untenable rates. Diversification also mitigates channel concentration risk. A change in terms of service of a dominant distribution platform might challenge the business’ existence. A demand generation portfolio might include search engine optimization, search engine marketing, social media marketing, influencer marketing, conferences/events, referral marketing, branding, partnerships, reseller agreements, outbound sales development, channel activation, analyst relations, and so on. How can one manage a broad and growing portfolio? By measuring them on those four axes. Sophistication: How sophisticated is the organization in leveraging the channel? How much experimentation, insight, predictability has the team developed? Breadth: How broad is the demand generation strategy? How many campaigns, how many creatives, how many partners, how many referrers? Potential: How many customers and much revenue could this channel bring if successful? Scale of investment: How large is the business’ investment in the customer acquisition channel? What is the spend on the people, software and media? Why are these four axes important? Imagine a table like the one below. Axis SEM LinkedIn Analyst Relations Referral Sophistication 9 4 1 6 Breadth 8 3 7 2 Potential 6 7 10 3 Scale 4 10 1 7 CAC 10,000 15,000 12,500 4,000 At a glance, a head of demand generation or a CEO can determine where the company is spending its demand generation efforts. And, whether the asset allocation is the optimal one given the current stage of the company. In the case above, the startup has a very sophisticated search engine marketing function with a reasonable cost of customer acquisition but has not scaled that program yet. On the other hand, LinkedIn spend is maxed out , but the team is still early in optimizing the channel. Last, referrals have substantial scale but not much potential. There are no right answers about what an optimal portfolio should look like. That will change over time and by company. The important part of this framework is to create a shared lexicon about how to evaluate demand generation portfolios, and what the best asset allocation might be for the business.

A friend recently asked, “Which path is better for SaaS startups? SMB to mid-market to enterprise or straight to enterprise?” It’s a key strategic question for many founders building software companies. Startups that initially target small to medium businesses benefit from several key advantages. First, these businesses are faster to revenue. Simpler products satisfy SMBs, so startups can begin to charge smaller customers much sooner than enterprise customers in a product development lifecycle. Second, these businesses tend to be more capital efficient. Cost of customer acquisition is lower in gross terms. The startup can hire less sophisticated sales teams, whose salaries are smaller. Most importantly, early revenue means small customers finance the product development for larger customers with their payments. In exchange for these benefits, SMB startups cede the enterprise market early on. And, as they pursue more sophisticated customers, these businesses must learn a new sales/marketing motion, and develop enterprise grade software in parallel. On the other hand, enterprise first startups require more capital upfront. These companies must develop enterprise grade software from the outset. Proofs of concept (PoCs) can offset some of those costs, but they tend not to generate meaningful revenue. In addition, these businesses must hire more sophisticated and expensive account executives. Because the deal sizes are larger, initial sales cycles are less predictable. There a fewer chances to iterate sales techniques, because there are fewer customers and the sales cycles are longer . But, once the startup masters the go to market strategy, that’s it. Just continue to repeat and execute the playbook at greater and greater scale. What does the data say? I haven’t found a meaningful difference in the sales efficiency , employee counts or revenue potential , or market cap . So, I can’t draw a conclusion from these analyses. Instead, the key conclusion is matching the strengths and passions of the management team to the go-to-market approach. When selling to the enterprise, credibility matters, rolodexes and relationships create competitive advantage, and the ability to raise a large initial round is essential. Those three things tend to come with experience. Startups building software for small to medium businesses don’t need any of these. Less capital is required. Product and value trump relationships. Account executives can learn the simple sales process quickly. Does this math change in the exit market? Oracle (enterprise) bought Netsuite (SMB) for $9.3B. Cisco (enterprise) buys AppDynamics (enterprise) for $3.7B. I can argue in either case. And the sample size is too small to really draw a conclusion. That’s a very long way of saying choose a go to market strategy that matches the strengths and passions of the team. There is no conclusive analysis that I’ve done yet to show an advantage one way or the other.

At a recent board meeting, a CEO said, “This experiment will cost $250,000 to run. After three months, we will know whether our new go-to-market strategy is viable.” There’s a brilliance this type of framing. By quantifying the cost of the experiment, the CEO frames company prioritization as asset allocation. What is asset allocation? Asset allocation is a strategy that aims to balance risk and reward by apportioning a startup’s assets according to a company’s goals and risk tolerance. (I’m borrowing heavily from Investopedia , and recasting the definition for startups). In other words, given the resources of the company today, how should the business whittle down the panoply of experiments before it to maximize chances of success? That’s the question facing every CEO of every company at every stage. From a new founder with $150k in friends and family, to Larry Page at Alphabet. But many people don’t think of a business in this way, though they should. A four month sprint to build a new product feature has a cost: employee salaries and the additional marketing budget to promote the feature. In addition, there’s a hidden cost, the opportunity cost. What could we do with those teams’ time if we don’t pursue that sprint? For most Series A companies, one month’s burn is measured in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. A full company effort over 4 months could be a million dollar bet. Is that the right move? Or should the business explore a smaller experiment to validate some hypotheses first? Of course, the difficulty with risk/reward planning isn’t calculating the cost, but estimating the reward. Could a new viral growth feature 10x the user base? Maybe, but without data, it’s all speculation. But cost is just as critical a component of the calculus, because it’s the limiting factor of experimental exploration. Experimentation is an important part of startup evolution. Prioritizing experiments is one of the most important things a CEO can do to guide a company. Reframing prioritization as asset allocation by calculating the cost of an experiment is a simple, powerful tool for choosing among alternatives.

Intel’s Business Plan Every once in a while, I receive a FedEx from an entrepreneur I haven’t met. Inevitably, this mail contains a modern rarity - a business plan. Ten to twenty pages describing the idea, the genesis, the business model, the team and its structure, customer acquisition strategy, sales model and other key details of the business. A plan for how to start a company, and a defense of the idea. Business plans used to be de rigeur , an essential part of starting a company and raising capital. Over the last decade or so, business plans have declined in importance, replaced by a Keynote presentation that dazzles with high resolution images and Helvetica Neue Light font. There are many good reasons for the transition to more visual sales pitches for companies. The most important: Founders can engender excitement with them in a way a 20 page comb-bound document simply can’t. But in that transition, we’ve lost something - the act of reflecting upon all the different aspects of building a company. Why does an opportunity exist now to create this company? How quickly can the business grow revenue? How much capital will the company require to attain different milestones? What are the competitive axes and who are my competitors? How much gross margin can the business generate? In addition, a business plan makes plain all the current team’s assumptions. Its creation is the best time to discuss, debate and argue the core strategy of the company. As a former product manager, I understand the allure the perfect product mirage. All I need is a great product and the rest will take care of itself. For a few companies, that might be the case. But most won’t enjoy that kind of fortune. In which case, a well researched plan bounds the unknown unknowns that inevitably will surprise founders as the business evolves.

There’s no quicker way to lose a user or buyer of your software than to lose their trust. The software didn’t save my data. The database suffered corruption. The website is down frequently. Data integrity is a challenge every company storing data faces. Machine learning SaaS startups face another trust risk – one introduced by probability. When Nate Silver forecasted the successful election of Barack Obama in 2008 with nearly 100% accuracy across districts, probability theory shined. The real world matched the likely predictions. Fast forward to eight years later, and the new President wasn’t the projected winner. In both the 2008 and 2016 analyses, the math may have been correct and the theory consistent. But in 2008, the results built trust in data and in 2016, the outcome eroded it. That’s part of human nature. Many machine learning systems also rely on probability. A programmer encodes a threshold into machine learning models. The system uses that threshold to decide when the probability is sufficient enough to draw conclusion. Sometimes this is called a confidence score. For example, the minimum probability that this image is contains a cat. The confidence level that that sacre blue should be translated as “Oh my gosh!” not “sacred blue.” The likelihood that taking the Van Wyck in rush hour is faster than the Belt Parkway to Manhattan from JFK. What should those minimum probabilities be before computer system makes a recommendation? 80%? 90%? 95%? Increase the probability and the number of false positives, or type 1 errors , decreases. Far fewer mongooses in your cat search results. But increasing the confidence threshold too much will invite type 2 errors . The system asserts an image doesn’t contain a cat. On further inspection, you can see plain as day, there’s a feline in that jpeg. Machine learning SaaS companies must find equilibrium on this Goldilocks slackline . Not too strict, not too lenient of a machine learning system. If the product falls too much to one extreme, the product may lose the user’s trust, and eventually their business. How best to manage this risk? The chatbot surge has taught me one principle of human/robot interaction . Setting the user’s expections of the system’s capacities is paramount. Underpromise and overdeliver. The converse leads to distrust. The second way is to determine which type of error is more palatable to a user. In the case of email spam detection, better to lead in a few irrelevant messages than to classify an email from Mom as spam. All of these next generation machine learning products will rely on building the trust of the user. At some point, those products must decide when the probability is good enough to recommend shifting marketing budget to a new campaign, classify an image, translate a word, trash a spam email, or escalate an error. That product decision should not be taken lightly. The ML system’s confidence score has a direct bearing on how much users will trust the product.

Cloudera is the second of the Hadoop players to go public. Last week, the company filed their S-1 and revealed a massive business. Cloudera generated $261M in revenue, counts 500 clients and grows those accounts by 43% annually. 18% of their customers run Cloudera software in the cloud, a surprisingly large number. Hortonworks is Cloudera’s chief competitor. In the following charts, we’ll compare the two businesses. These analyses compare the two companies based on the year they went public, marked 0 in the charts. Negative years are years before IPO. Hortonworks grew very quickly. $27M, $46M, $122M at IPO and then $184M the year after IPO. Cloudera grew from $109M to $166M to $261M, more than 2x the revenue scale of Hortonworks. Hortonworks tallied a tremendous growth rate of 165% at IPO. In the year after IPO, growth settled to 52% which is comparable to Cloudera’s 57%. Cloudera generates about $332k per customer, placing it third on the list of software companies below Veeva and Workday. Hortonworks isn’t far off at $142k per customer at IPO, seventh on the list. Higher isn’t necessarily better, but likely reflect a larger initial customer contract for Cloudera. This could be a result of a larger initial deployment, a broader product sale or pricing power in the market. Let’s look at profitability. Both of these businesses generate substantial net income losses. The median public software company records -10% net income to revenue ratio. These two businesses burn much more: -72% for Cloudera and -137% for Hortonworks. The cash burn story is a bit better. Cash flow from operations for both businesses is trending toward cash flow breakeven. The difference between net income and cash flow figures revolve around revenue recognition and how frequently customers pay for services up-front. For more, read this . Cloudera generates 67 points of gross margin compared to Hortonworks’ 61 points. We can break that down into gross margin on the software and professional services. Cloudera generates more of their revenue through licenses, which also boosts their overall gross margin: 23% vs 31% for HDP. The companies are nearly identical in their software gross margins at 81% for Cloudera and 82% for Hortonworks. Professional services margin explains the overall difference. Cloudera generates 6 more points of gross margin in professional services: 21% vs 15%. In addition, Cloudera generates less of its revenue through services. Cloudera also has an edge in estimated sales efficiency at 0.59 vs 0.47 for Hortonworks. This is likely due to a 2x increase in the average account size relative to HDP. That’s a lot of charts already, but if you’re interested to see how Sales & Marketing spending and Research & Development spending differs, click on the links to see the charts. In conclusion, Cloudera has built an immense business. It was the first company to commercialize Hadoop and has built an iconic brand inseparable from the category. Compared to Hortonworks, Cloudera is a bit bigger at IPO, more efficient in acquiring customers, and commands larger customer sizes. Congratulations to the Cloudera team on their success.

The most satisfying compliment the reader can pay this to tell me they feel personally addressed. Think of your favorite authors and see if that isn’t precisely one of the things that engages you, and often at first without noticing it. A good conversation is the only human equivalent. Christopher Hitchens, a famous journalist, wrote this in his book Mortality. After writing nearly 1000 blog posts, I have to agree. Paul Graham [says it a different way](Here’s a simple trick for getting more people to read what you write: write in spoken language.). “Here’s a simple trick for getting more people to read what you write: write in spoken language… You don’t need fancy words describe complex ideas.” Dictation is one way of writing the way you speak. Though the technology has improved, this idea isn’t new. Henry James and Joseph Conrad dictated their later novels. This post is also dictated. But, that’s not enough to be engaging. Over the years, I’ve read many books on writing. Because I write often, I want to improve. One of my favorites is called Several Short Sentences written by Verlyn Klinkenborg who was a member of the New York Times editorial board for 16 years. Write each sentence on its own line, the book advises. That way you can ensure you are varying your sentence length. The combination of short and long sentences keeps the reader engaged. Then there are the classics like On Writing Well by William Zinsser, Steven King’s On Writing and the grammar school stalwart The Elements of Style . They all argue similar things. Reduce adverbs. Keep sentences simple. Employ strong verbs. At one point, I hired an editor. Not to edit blog posts before I published them, but to help me afterwards. I asked him, “Grade them like an AP English teacher would.” My goal wasn’t to improve individual posts, but to identify major problems with my writing. Exactly the way Mr. Dunn corrected my papers in twelfth grade. Today, I use HemingwayApp , a little web application highlights my sins: run-on sentences, grammatical inconsistencies, and long-winded paragraphs. For me, the greatest compliment someone can give when I meet them is that they feel like they’ve met me before because they’ve heard my voice through this blog. That is my biggest learning about writing. The key is finding your voice to start a conversation Hitchens again: “Without our corresponding feeling for the idiolect, the stamp on the way and individual actually talks, and therefore writes, we would be deprived of a whole continent of human sympathy, and of its minor key pleasures such as mimicry and parody.” That’s what great writing is all about: engendering common-ground with the reader to start a conversation.

Over the last year in particular, Revenue Ops is a term that’s gaining some mindshare in the SaaS world. Revenue operations teams combine marketing operations and sales operations into one team. Yesterday, I heard  time a further refinement of this idea: Customer Operations. As one SaaS executive described to me, marketing operations teams are the engines of the marketing team. The creative marketing functions produce the fuel – the campaigns, the positioning, the art. The engine, marketing ops teams disseminate these assets. They measure their performance and optimize customer acquisition to maximize return on investment. Sales operations teams perform analogous work to support salespeople. SalesOps helps salespeople close customers better and faster. Their efforts simplify quote creation, esignature, billing processes, and presentation software, among other things. There’s one simple rationale for unifying these teams: to optimize the customer journey. Marketing teams and sales teams use different metrics to measure performance.  Marketing teams focus on lead generation. Sales teams optimize bookings. But the ultimate goal for both of these teams is to grow the business as quickly and efficiently as possible by providing the best experience to a customer. To accomplish this goal, a RevOps team defines a canonical set of metrics to measure customer health and sales efficiency. Consequently, RevOps teams can measure the impact of sales operations experiments on marketing operations and vice versa. Then they can pursue a global optimum, rather than a local maximum. If you’d like to read more about RevOp theory, Radius published an excellent white paper on the topic . But why stop there? There is another critical component of every SaaS go to market. The Customer Success team. RevOps’ understanding of the customer stops at the sale. Shouldn’t the data operations team understand long-term customer behavior after the sale? And the impact of upstream optimizations to those metrics ? That’s the idea behind Customer Operations. Customer Ops provides the software and metrics for the entirety of the customer journey. From first touch to ongoing support and expansion. Such a team measures and optimize customer experience from end-to-end. Also, this team can provide a start up a holistic, data-driven perspective on growth. At least, that’s the idea. So far, I know of only one company that has implemented this. It’s been very successful. Global optimization is a much better long term strategy than local optimization across three teams. We’re in the very earliest days of what could be a fundamental reconfiguration of SaaS operations teams. Customer Operations could be very powerful construct for growing companies through end-to-end optimization of the customer journey.

When I first met Jen Grant, Looker’s CMO, she told me a story from early days of Box, where she was SVP of Marketing. Jen spoke about the importance of creating tension in the marketing message. Aaron Levie, Box’s CEO and founder, spoke at conferences about the future of collaboration. His message: Box will transform the way employees work. But if you had visited www.box.net , you would have found another positioning for the company. A very simple one. Box replaces FTP. How can a business have such different positioning in two different places? This is the tension. As Jen explained to me, each positioning served a particular purpose. When Aaron presented on stage, his audience comprised C-level executives at Fortune 2000 companies. The goal was not to sell to them immediately, but to position Box to them for sale in a year or two or three. After all, the company and product were still quite early. This strategy educated enterprise customers well in advance of a sales process. In the meantime, the Box.net website focused on solving immediate problems for visitors. How to move large files easily. This immediate value proposition optimized the conversion funnel for the product at the time. As the company grew, the product deepened and broadened. Each year the offering approached the ultimate vision Aaron shared on stage. Several years later, Box approached those same enterprise buyers with the same vision. But, this time the product delivered the brand promise: the future of collaboration. This is an insightful story for two reasons. First, it demonstrates how to create tension between the marketing message and the product. Though the product may not be there yet, the audience understands where the company is headed. So when the product matures, the buyer is receptive. Second, the anecdote underscores the importance of customer segmentation . Customer segmentation is a powerful tool to divide your startup’s customer base. Customers may fall into SMB, midmarket, enterprise. Or horizontal and vertical. Or any other ontology that suits the business. In Box’s case, the enterprise customer segment heard speeches about the company vision. Meanwhile, the current customer base, an SMB segment, received much more tactical campaigns. Customer segments become part of the language of a startup. They help focus a marketing message to each. Those messages influence products, sales, engineering, and customer success. In other words, every part of the business. Marketing is a continuum. One of the key disciplines is determining which customer segments matter, what messages to distribute to them, and how to create a tension between where the product is today and where the company will ultimately be.

When should you sell your business? There is no universal to this answer because the question is multifaceted and unique to each company. But we can answer another related question. Given a declining growth rate, when is my company’s value maximized? Startups strategic value lies within their ability to grow. The faster a company can grow, the more valuable it is. This relationship is remarkably linear. The chart above shows the public SaaS median EV/TTM multiple. EV is enterprise value, or market cap minus cash. TTM is trailing twelve months revenue - the sum of the last twelve months of revenue. A business that grew 100% last year is worth 14.4x its trailing twelve months revenue, net of cash. And a company that grew 25% last year is worth 4.2x. The R^2 between revenue growth and multiple is 0.66. This means the growth rate explains 66% of the variance of the multiple, quite a strong relationship. Assume a startup generates $50M per year. Let’s see how the value evolves in three different scenarios. Scenario #1. The company grows 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2. Enterprise value increases from $736M to $1B. Scenario #2. The company grows a 75% in year 1 and 50% in year 2. EV rises from $582M to $642M. Scenario #3. The company grows 50% in year 1 and 25% in year two. EV declines from $428M to $342M, despite a revenue increase of $12.5M. This is the counterintuitive part. Just because the business grows doesn’t means it increases its value. It has to grow at a certain rate to be worth more. In the last scenario, the company’s EV falls by 20% despite a 25% revenue increase. I can poke many holes in this analysis. Mainly, I’m valuing a business only by one metric, which doesn’t reflect the reality. But the point still holds. Startups are valued for their growth. At some point, if the business can’t grow fast enough, its enterprise value will fall year over year. Selling a business before that occurs will maximize its value.

There are four lies managers tell themselves to avoid one of the hardest conversations in business. Things will improve. Someone in the seat is better than no one in the seat. Let’s transfer the person to another team where things might improve. The termination will hurt morale in the company or the team. I’ve told myself all of these in the past. What’s the best way to move past these and execute the difficult task of letting someone go? When I moved to California, I worked for Kim Scott at Google as my first job. Kim has an impressive career from working in the diamond industry, to starting a company in the dotcom era. She became a director at Google, taught at Apple University and advised companies like Dropbox and Twitter. Kim’s most impressive characteristic, though, isn’t her resume. It’s her relentless pursuit of becoming a better manager, and her willingness to experiment with management style and empower her teams. “That’s a great idea. You should do it,” was one of the most frequent replies in meetings with Kim. Once, Kim emailed the AdSense team an article from HBR about the importance of creativity, and a short time thereafter, she rolled out software to collect ideas from the entire team. She appointed an Ideas team. At some point, I was part of it. We prioritized different efforts that ultimately had meaningful impact on the business. Kim had figured out how to empower at scale. But it all started with empathy for her team’s ideas to improve our operations. The four lies we tell ourselves about firing people above originate from Kim’s book, Radical Candor. Kim’s advice for firing people underscores her compassion for people in her teams. You have to embrace the pain that the person will feel, help them come to terms with it, and point them in the direction of something that might be a better fit for their development. Radical Candor’s central theme is how to deliver difficult guidance to team members with empathy. Management is an art, a blend of chemistry and style. But the book distills that complexity into three frameworks to help managers lead teams empathetically through direct feedback and encouraging open critique. I know that sounds like an oxymoron. But it’s not. It’s the most effective way to lead that I’ve experienced, and the best way to cultivate a team. It all starts by being honest and setting aside the lies we tell ourselves to avoid having hard conversations.

In 2016, the number of seeds has fallen by a 27.6% reduction in the number of seed rounds. But as the chart above shows, the median amount invested in seed rounds continues to increase at about 40% annually. This trend  started in 2014 and has continued through the first quarter of 2017. These two forces in opposition netted a 10% increase in total dollars in 2016. The average number of investors per seed round has plateaued at about two. A few years ago, party rounds seem to prevail in the press. But data doesn’t support a broad change. In fact, the distribution of seed investor count hasn’t changed materially over the last seven years. It’s quite nearly always 2. The big trend is the increasing prevalence of second seed rounds. Second seeds are seed rounds raised after an initial seed round. Though quite rare in 2010, startups have raised more than 750 second seed rounds in each of the last three years. Second seeds now represent approximately one in three seed rounds. This is a big contributor to the increase in median seed round size. Several founders have asked me recently how investors perceive second seed rounds. This data shows that they are broadly accepted as a common way to finance an early stage startup. There is no stigma with these rounds. The chart above shows the median amount of a first seed round and a second seed round. The first seed round has persisted below $400,000 throughout the dataset. The anomaly in 2017 is due to an outlier. Only one company has raised two seed rounds so far in 2017, qualifying it into this dataset. In contrast, median second seed size has more than doubled. Since 2013, median second seed size has increased by 18% annually. It now exceeds the overall median. Startups that raise one seed round typically raise $1.0M in that round, compared to startups that raise two seeds, who raise about $1.6M across those two rounds. The very earliest investors’ appetite and deal structure seems not to be changing. However, the increases in second-seeded rounds suggest investors are competing more for these opportunities.  Consequently, round size and valuation increase. Overall, it is difficult to paint the seed market is anything other than healthy. The total amount of capital available to seed startups is constant. The amount they can raise is increasing. Second-seed have become ubiquitous. All of these different factors contribute to strong financing market to support the very earliest companies.

There are three kinds of software value propositions. Software that increases revenue, software that reduces cost, and software that promises improved productivity. To maximize the effectiveness of your customer success efforts, you need to understand which type of software company you are building. Software that increases revenue is the easiest to sell. For most companies, growth is the most important priority. Growth trumps cost-reduction because growth increases the value of the business more. As a result, products that grow revenue enjoy shorter sales cycles and larger budgets. Most sales acceleration and lead generation software falls into this category. Software that reduces costs rely on an efficiency value proposition.  “Buy the software and you will save thousands or millions of dollars.”  The sale is straightforward and the buyer justifies the purchase easily and has created some enormous businesses. Typically, startups capture 10 – 15% of the customers’ savings. This is the upper bound of the business’s pricing power and market size. Productivity software often looks like cost-reduction software. But the cost savings or revenue increases are less clear and quantifiable.  Reduce meetings. Collaborate better.  Understand your business better. Hire better. Insure your company’s risk.  These value propositions are at least one step removed from  revenue increases or cost reductions.  Collaboration products, productivity tools, business intelligence software,  human resources information systems, security products. All of these fit into this category. Revenue increasers need to continue to increase revenue over time. Customer retention hinges on proving the continuous marginal revenue the software delivers. Cost reducers must reduce costs further and further. Each year, the customer will ask, how much more efficiency deliver to my business? In both of these cases, the value proposition will asymptote at some point. There are only so many more leads the software can surface or only so much cost software can excise. The productivity value proposition, though murkier, provides customer success teams more room to grow accounts and sustain them over time. Salesforce’s CRM provide sales leaders visibility into their pipeline. This value proposition is eternal. At no point will a VP of Sales declare, “I no longer need to forecast my pipeline.” There are two trade-offs. First, the pricing power of the business is less clear. How much is the VPS willing to pay? The startup must establish that through price discovery. Second, customer success efforts are less obvious. CS teams must suss out the customer needs, build an account plan, and help the customer achieve their goals. But, the nature of these relationships lend themselves to broader product footprints. The deeper a startup understands a customers challenges, the more products and services the business can sell. Each of these approaches can lead to enormous businesses. The key part is understanding the type of value proposition your startup offers, and matching the GTM and customer success strategy to it.

I once asked a VP of Marketing at a top SaaS company how she thought of content programming. What is the right type of content to create? I asked her. She replied with a brilliant little insight, “I  look at way the best content marketers in the world do it. The TV networks.” News dominates the early morning. Then, daytime television takes over targeting those who stay at home. At noon, news for those who power lunch. Soap operas and game shows after midday. News in the afternoon as people come home. Game shows, sitcoms, and drama for after-dinner entertainment. She explained that networks focus each time-segment on a particular persona. The length of the shows, their cadence, and their content all match the persona. Today, Netflix has developed even more sophisticated means of matching content to personas. They study which shows garner populations. Statisticians analyze the core ingredients of successful shows. With this insight, producers create new series embodying the right characteristics. The same ideas apply in SaaS. The most sophisticated content marketing teams mechanize this process with a calendar. The content marketing calendar identifies which persona receives which content each day. Also, marketers who plan content guide prospects and customers through a journey. The three steps of the buyer journey are awareness, consideration, decision. The steps of the customer journey differ by business. But they involve product education, community building, account management. All tasks key to customer success. Best-in-class content marketing is a discipline that requires careful planning and strategic thinking. Which personas matter? On which journey do they embark? What programming advances them? This effort does require substantial investment. But it can engender a sustainable competitive advantage for startups that reduces cost of customer acquisition and churn.

Most startups go to market with the intent to differentiate their product. Each one of us has an idea what might make a better CRM, marketing automation suite or customer support. Other startups prefer to combine a product innovation with a reinvention of the sales process. The four key innovations in SaaS sales strategies I’ve observed so far are: Bottoms-up . The buyer is very difficult to reach through traditional channels and consequently is prohibitively expensive to acquire at scale. Typically, the buyer prefers to educate themselves, build consensus internally and influence the ultimate decision. Most developer products have sales processes like this: Twilio, Stripe, Heroku adoption starts as a side project or hobby, and then eventually becomes a corporate purchase. Slack and Expensify start in small pockets of a company, until they grow and become the dominant platform. In these models, customer success teams are the de facto the sales teams. Segmentation . Commodity products dominate the market and consequently,go-to-market differentiation sets the winner apart. Solarwinds leveraged an disciplined inside-sales model with aggressive prospect disqualification in the commodity network monitoring space to build a $4.3B business. Channel . The core buyer market chooses their software based on the recommendations of trusted partners, and a new entrant wins over this channel. Xero used the channel strategy to great success in Australia and New Zealand. They educated accountants, who in turn recommended Xero to their clients. Platform change . These don’t happen very often, but a shift from on-premises to SaaS, or PC to mobile suddenly changes customer acquisition costs. The first to learn the new paradigm and leverage it wins. Salesforce is the canonical SaaS example. But the distinction of the first major-mobile first SaaS company hasn’t yet been awarded. When startups can combine product innovations with sales innovations, they can certainly create enduring companies. There are a few challenges that are worth mentioning. Most important is the additional complexity. Finding product market fit is not an easy thing. Adding a further complication of experimenting with a novel go-to-market increases the difficulty. More product time is spent refining funnels and optimizing them because the product tends to be a key part of the sales process (PQL). More sales time is used to define the new sales motion, and hire a novel type of account executive and sales leader to ensure its success. Is it worth it strategically to approach the market with a novel GTM and a best-in-class product? There’s no one answer. But when it works, you’ve found a new way up the mountain and created a sustainable competitive advantage.

After a SaaS startup has gained traction with SMBs and mid-market customers, they often feel a pressure to move up-market. Sometimes, demand for a product is so great, larger customers the pull the company up-market before they are ready. The startup finds itself in a critical position - both the product and the sales motion must evolve quickly. Zack Kass is a friend who advises SaaS startups on their enterprise selling motions and playbooks, refining the account executive profile, and developing a deal strategy. Together, they form foundation of their enterprise sales strategy. Zack’s expertise comes from experience, and as he’ll tell you, each startup’s enterprise sales strategy is a bespoke suit, sculpted to enhance a company’s strengths. Zack and I agree that unlike the custom go-to-market strategy a startup must develop, the list of product features necessary to move into the enterprise is fairly standardized. In most cases, an enterprise buyer insists upon a predetermined set of features and capabilities before signing a purchase order. But what are they? Replicated, Segment and Jaspersoft recently published an open-source guide to moving into the enterprise called EnterpriseReady.io . Single Sign On integration, audit logs, and role based access control are three of the eleven categories. Each category includes a description of the feature with links to examples that walk through implementations from leading SaaS companies . Ultimately, these are the first features that will signal to enterprise buyers that a startup’s product is ready for enterprise adoption. The team’s ability to speak credibly about these features and their benefits is critical to success up-market - not just in product and sales, but marketing, customer support and engineering. This collection of 11 features is a useful resource to guide product managers on the key aspects of an enterprise product and lead the conversations internally about roadmap priorities as the company transitions from serving the mid-market.

Every software company competes with another — if not directly, then at least for budget. With global IT spending flat to down in 2015 and 2016 , software businesses are fighting for share of wallet. At this point, the critical marketing imperative is to start a conversation with a receptive buyer, and do it thousands of times per year. But how? I met a master software marketer last week, and he shared some of his wisdom. A luminary, he has built the positioning, packaging, and pricing for several multi-billion dollar software companies. The marketer’s fundamental challenge: buyers don’t perceive a substantial difference amongst vendors. A 2015 CEB study confirmed this: Over and over we found that customers, generally speaking, see significantly less difference between us and the competition than we do ourselves. It’s not that they think most suppliers are particularly bad on brand, product, or service. It’s just that [customers] don’t think [suppliers are] particularly different. This master marketer pointed to our language. Within in a market, competitors often use the same language to describe their products. Big data. Machine learning. Cloud. Inevitably, the pitches sound the same. His advice: choose new words to describe your business and your value proposition. These new words raise questions in the buyer’s mind: What is this new thing? How is it different? Why haven’t I heard about it before? Apple does this consistently. The Retina display premiered with iPhone 4. Apple coined Retina to distinguish screens with pixels too small for the human eye to see. The rest of the market described their displays in pixels (e.g., 960x640). The Retina term changed the competitive landscape. Which devices are Retina? Only Apple. Why don’t more software companies frame their products differently? First, there’s the pull of the analysts and fitting into a market segment. Second, there’s the inertia of describing a product similarly to others to bootstrap demand. We’re like X but different in this regard. Third, it’s not easy. It requires creativity and the willingness to make a bet. But it’s worth doing because if it works, novel framing skews the playing field in your favor and increases your sales success. Employing new words in marketing open the door to a challenger sale , which is the most effective sales technique. Challenger sales people represent 23% of the population, but 39% of top performers. Challenger salespeople start by listening to understand their customers problem. Then they insert a new perspective to a problem and debate the superiority with their customers. By combining new language with a challenger sales techniques, the marketing team sets up the sales team for success. Novel language, challenger sales, innovative product is a powerful combination.

Esquire writer and master storyteller Cal Fussman describes the experience of interviewing his childhood hero, Muhammad Ali, in a podcast with Tim Ferriss . Fussman spends a week with Ali, during which he the Special Olympics and boxes with the great champion. But there’s one story that stood out to me. Fussman and Ali must catch a plane, but they are running late. Later in his life, Ali suffered from Parkinson’s disease, which slowed him significantly. Fussman is worried about missing the plane, and is trying to hurry them through security. Just then, a woman pulls a camera from her purse to take a photo with Ali. Ali stops, walks towards her and takes several photographs with her, before continuing on. When Fussman asks Ali why he did it, Ali replies, “That was likely the only opportunity she would have to take a photograph with me. I wanted to make sure she had the one she wanted.” Certainly, the experience gave Ali some satisfaction, but as Fussman relates in the interview, the empathy Ali showed impressed him the most. Fussman confesses in the podcast that he respected and admired Ali more after having met him - something that doesn’t happen with many heroes. The entire story reminded me of an old friend who often tells me, “We are lent into each other’s keeping.” Our time with each other is borrowed, it’s duration is unknown, and that uncertainty make it precious. Ali recognizes this uncertainty, and finds a moment to show empathy, understanding and be kind. Fussman ends the interview with Ali asking him for words of wisdom. When Fussman asks, “How you define evil?”, Ali replies, “Unfriendliness.” As I’m rushing through my days, trying to make a plane or get to the next meeting, I think about Ali, hobbled by Parkinson’s, the best known celebrity of his generation, dancing through the airport, still taking the time to be kind to a stranger. We are lent into each other’s keeping.

The public markets have changed the way they value SaaS companies. The median forward revenue multiple for SaaS business reached its peak in February 2014, fell to its nadir two years later, and has since recovered, hovering at around five times forward revenue –  where it has remained with little variance over the last six months. However, that’s not the whole story. It’s not just that the median has fallen. Rather, every SaaS company is now being valued in a much narrower range than even a few years ago. In 2014, forward revenue multiples ranged from 1× to more than 20x. There were lots of outliers, marked as little points in the box plot above. And the whiskers extended at least to 15x. Those whiskers show the distribution of valuations within two standard deviations of the mean. Starting in the beginning of 2015 however there is been a marked compression. The whiskers now only extend to 10x, and the smattering of outliers has all but disappeared. Here’s another way of looking at that trend. The chart above shows the standard deviation of forward multiples over the same time period. It has fallen by 144% in four years. Why are valuation ranges so much tighter than they used to be? SaaS isn’t new. The first shares of Salesforce traded on the New York Stock Exchange 13 years ago. There are two ramifications. First, public market investors have become more sophisticated in understanding these businesses and valuing them. These public companies are incorporating more SaaS metrics into their public filings, like dollar expansion and dollar retention. Second, many of the iconic SaaS companies’ growth rates are slowing as they scale, a natural evolution of the business. In addition, there haven’t been many next-generation software companies going public. These newcomers would have substantially higher growth rates than their older brothers, and would command higher multiples. With tens of companies lined up to go public this year, we should see some expansion in these multiples. In contrast, the M&A market is setting new highwater marks for valuation multiples. Cisco paid the largest forward multiple of any acquisition earlier this year when they bought AppDynamics. What’s more, they exceeded the high watermark by 50% . With acquisitions now representing about 80% of startup exits, perhaps those valuation multiples are more representative of how SaaS companies should be valued. Especially since the basket of public SaaS companies is now dominated by older incumbents, whose growth rates are substantially smaller than this generation of growth stage disruptors.

All the while, this brand building effort is a substantial investment in reducing cost-of-customer-acquisition. Dale Carnegie’s seminal book How to Make Friends and Influence People introduced the powerful notion of social proof to millions. Social proof is the psychological phenomenon behind the power of word-of-mouth marketing. The old trope “No one gets fired for buying IBM” is a manifestation of social proof in an enterprise sales process. Social proof is an incredibly powerful force. The Buffer team wrote a great post detailing the five types of social proof : expert, celebrity, users, wisdom of the crowds, and wisdom of friends.  Sales and marketing teams already leverage social proof because it’s so effective. Many SaaS websites feature customer stories very prominently . Customer success teams can employ the same playbook. Terrific customer success teams identify evangelists, nurture relationships and direct their enthusiasm to help the company grow. Examples include finding and selecting the customers to provide references and testimonials for marketing material and sales pitches; or speaking on behalf of a company at an event; or very simply, encouraging fans to refer new customers. Initially, these efforts build user social proof. Soon, wisdom of friends and expert social proof come into play. And some companies like Zendesk achieve wisdom of the crowds social proof, which can drive huge volumes of new organic business. Throughout this process, the company is building a brand for itself and a product.

Draw an image of a bicycle that depicts how the bicycle works. You might draw something like this bike above. Or this one. Or this one. But as Gianluca Gimini discovered when he asked 50 people over the course of six years to draw a bicycle, most people cannot - despite their great confidence of the contrary. Gimini rendered these drawings (on the right) 	to highlight incorrect most people’s understanding of a bicycles anatomy truly is. This is the illusion of explanatory depth or IOED, which Rozenbilt and Keil described in 2002 People feel they understand complex phenomena with far greater precision, coherence, and depth than they really do; they are subject to an illusion — an illusion of explanatory depth. The illusion is far stronger for explanatory knowledge than many other kinds of knowledge, such as that for facts, procedures or narratives. The authors argued IOED occurs for four reasons. First, we overestimate how much we remember. Second, there are several levels of explanation for how things work. You could describe the bike as two wheels, pedals and a chain. A deeper level of explanation might introduce brakes, brake pads. Yet another level might delve into the physics of how bicycles balance (something physicists haven’t fully explained yet ). Third, the explanation varies depending on the sophistication of the questioner. Fourth, we don’t practice explaining things very often. So how does this illusion apply in the world of startups? The illusion enables a great interviewing technique. When worked at Google, I interviewed product managers. I was given a set of questions to ask, and one of my favorites was “how would you redesign one of your favorite  products?” Interviewees might pick a toothbrush or a piece of software or camera. Over the next 10-15 minutes, I would poke and prod. Why do you like the product? How does it work? Which are the most important design considerations? And finally, how would you improve it? Though I didn’t know it then, this line of questioning attempts to expose the illusion of explanatory depth. Can the candidate communicate the basic functions of the product but also plumb the nuances of the product and the key design decisions? Why was the toothbrush handle molded that way? How does the software onboard users? How does the single lens reflex camera work? This technique applies equally well for marketing technology stacks to PR managers to query planning database engineers. Using the IOED in interviewing questions enables interviews to identify candidates who deeply understand how to build a bicycle, or a marketing stack, or an optimized query plan.

There are three ways to create negative churn that I have observed in the market. First, usage expansion. Second, feature expansion. Third, product expansion. Usage expansion is the most common way to create negative churn. Utility based pricing models like buying SMS credits on Twilio, or compute on Amazon or data processing on Mulesoft lend themselves to gradually increasing account sizes, as customers use more and more of the product. Per seat pricing also leads to usage expansion if product lends itself to growing within an customer. Slack and Expensify might win more seats as word of the products get out and the company grows. Of course, the pricing plan has to be structured in a way to encourage this kind of behavior. All-you-can-eat plans  won’t engender dollar expansion of accounts. In the case of per seat pricing, if the initial sale fully penetrates an organization, then there is no usage expansion to be had. This highlights a strategic question facing many per seat pricing companies:  Does the business land and expand in order to engender negative churn or maximize the total revenue by closing a comprehensive deal today? Product expansion is also called cross-selling. This means offering multiple products to the same customer in order to increase the account value. Salesforce might initially lead with their CRM tool, but soon an account executive will offer marketing automation or the Heroku platform to increase the customer’s spend with Salesforce. However, most early-stage SaaS companies offer only one product, so product expansion is typically limited to later stage companies who can finance multiple product development. Hence, it’s less common. Feature expansion also called up-selling, involves migrating customers from a lower paying plan to a higher plan.  The canonical three pane pricing page often discriminates pricing by feature. For example, Expensify has three pricing buckets: team, corporate and enterprise. Customers upgrading from team at $5 per active user per month to the corporate plan at $9 per user per month benefit from more complex approval workflows and synchronization with upmarket financial packages like NetSuite. Feature expansion does have some challenges. First, the SaaS startup must demarcate the buckets well. They must decipher which features are going to entice customers to upgrade. Second, upsell opportunities are less frequent. A customer likely only upgrades from one plan to another one every few years, so there’s a limited opportunity to repeat this behavior. Many SaaS startups are starting to combine expansion strategies. If you use the 3 part tariff pricing strategy , it’s easy to see how feature expansion maps to the platform fee and usage expansion maps to the marginal cost fee. Expansion strategies raise the question of whether negative churn is always a good thing. Most of the time, it’s a wonderful thing. But, a huge annual account expansion each year can indicate that the entry price point is too low, and the business is leaving money on the table. Is a high velocity sales team selling lots of $10k deals with 200% annual expansion better than a sales team selling $20k deals with slightly slower sales velocity, but more cash up-front? That all depends on the strategy of the business. Expansion ties back to the three pricing strategies of a startup skimming, penetration and maximization. Startups that pursue the penetration strategy will likely have substantially better negative churn figures than the ones who pursue maximization. But they might trade that negative churn for better cash collections. These three types of dollar account expansion techniques can be powerful if used properly. They highlight the importance of aligning the go-to-market strategy, especially the pricing with the customer success strategy, to maximize upsell.

Founded in 2006, Mulesoft is an 850 person company based in San Francisco that builds data integration tools. The company started originally as an open-source product and then focused on its paid offering. Today, the business generates nearly $200 million annually in revenue, and is growing at 70%. The business filed to go public last week , and the documents reveal a very impressive business operating at scale. The chart above shows the subscription revenue is roughly at $150 million and professional services revenue is about $35 million this year. Growing quickly at the scale is no mean thing. In 2015, Mulesoft grew 91% and in 2016 the business grew 71%.  There are three contributors to this growth. First, the number of customers grew from 592 to 839 to 1071 over the last three years. Second, new customer contract value has more than doubled from $77,000 in 2014 to $169,000 in 2016. Mulesoft prices is a function of the amount of computation power charged by customers and this doubling of average contract size suggests the sales team is able to convince customers to buy more of the software at the outset. There is less of an argument to be made that the company is moving upmarket as it has sold to enterprise customers for a long time. Third, Mulesoft boasts great dollar retention that has grown from 110% to 117% over the last years. This dollar retention metric compares favorably to other public traded software companies like Box and ServiceNow, whose dollar retention is in a similar ballpark. Mulesoft average contract value for new customers is $169,000 which places it as the fifth-largest for any publicly traded software company that has filed an S-1. In terms of gross margin, the business is operating at about 74%,  is better than the public software average of 71%. Professional services margins used to be -25%, but the company has brought that figure up to breakeven in the last year. This may also be a contributing factor to the increase in average contract value. Mulesoft is rapidly approaching  cash flow from operations breakeven and net income profitability. Cash flow from operations breakeven means the business generates as much cash as it consumes setting aside financing and investing activities. Mulesoft operated with a estimated sales efficiency of 0.57 in 2015 and a estimated sales efficiency of 0.63, which implies a payback period of 19 months, right on the average. The business has raised $259 with $103 million remaining on the balance sheet. To compare this figure with similar companies, AppDynamics has raised $364 million, Workday has raised $175 million, and that the bottom end of the spectrum, ServiceNow raised $84 million. Mulesoft is an incredible company. To be growing at 70% while generating more than $150 million in revenue is an incredible accomplishment. The other metrics of the business are right in line with the rest of the market, and suggest Mulesoft will be an important business for a long time to come.

We’ve taught computers to do many things. We’ve researched how to teach them to identify cats, spot fraudulent charges, even categorize cucumbers. But what can we apply in our daily lives that computers have taught us? That is the premise of the book called Algorithms to Live By . Which of the advances in computer science can be applied to laundry, choosing an executive assistant, picking the best strategic plan and optimizing your schedule? One of the hardest challenges in hiring someone to fill a role is knowing when to stop looking, when to declare that the current best candidate is very likely the most perfect fit. After all, we never have full information. We never know who else might apply for the role, or perfect references. There’s a simple rule that a computer scientist proved mathematically. You should choose the next best candidate after completing 37% of the search. It sounds crazy, almost too simplistic, but the math bears that out, assuming certain conditions. There’s also a chapter on how to choose the best among a group of options. In the world of computer science, it’s called the multi-arm bandit problem. A one armed bandit is a nickname for slot machine, and this branch of research has to do with how to pick among a group of slot machines. Do you pick the one that you’ve played on for a while, or a new one, and when do you switch? In a management team meeting, the same dynamic is a play when debating continuing with the current strategy or migrating to a new one. When is the right time to switch? When do you have enough information? And how do you pick among a group of options? In short, it’s all about figuring out which option has the greatest upside. But this book isn’t entirely about algorithms. There is a chapter on when to think less: “What would happen if we started from the premise that we can’t measure what matters and go from there? Then instead of measurement we have to use something very scary: it’s called judgment.” Algorithms to Live By has changed the way I think about investing in startups and advising them. The book provides a framework for thinking through difficult decisions, the kinds of questions we’ve asked computers to solve for decades. There’s a lot we can learn from all of their hard work.

From the millions of Amazon Alexas to the self-driving car, new products are coming to market infused with machine learning. The innovation offered by machine learning techniques are real, and they will changed the SaaS world. But how? How can startups use machine learning to their advantage? There are four broad applications of machine learning: Optimize - this morning, fastest way to travel from Sand Hill Road to South Park in San Francisco is highway 101. The job requisition for an account executive on our website uses too many clichés. To close more business , speak slower, talk about pricing later in the call, and use this case study. Identify objects - the photograph you just took with your smartphone contains a cat. Find all red plaid woolen shorts in an ecommerce store. The CT scan shows high likelihood of Parkinson’s Disease. Detect anomalies - your credit card shows a $10,000 charge for a piano from a store in Nairobi. Your server cluster is operating at historically high CPU usage. Customers are responding to this morning’s lead generation email at 25% greater rates than last week’s campaign. Segment data - customers who come to our product through the mobile app store show 15% higher engagement. These applications alone make for tremendous advances. But, combinations of these applications lead to incredible things. Object identification + anomaly detection + robotics = self driving cars. Or brick-laying robots that erect walls three times faster than humans. I’ve written before about the monstrous acceleration in machine learning innovation. The monocloud vendors (Amazon, Google and Microsoft) are rapidly innovating, publishing breakthrough results and offering APIs that leverage this new research for pennies and nickels. Consequently, every startup can use these technologies for just the cost of a few ramen boxes. But just plugging those APIs, buying the .ai domain name and inserting the words machine learning/artificial intelligence to your sales pitch isn’t sufficient to succeed. Rather than trump machine learning, make the technology disappear into the product. Create that magical moment with the user. The best sales and fundraising pitches describe a startup’s value proposition without mentioning machine learning. Instead, they focus on how the product increases revenue, decreases cost, or wins the buyer a promotion . We’ve invested in more than 20 companies leveraging machine learning to create enduring and category-defining companies, from Stripe to RelateIQ, Chorus to Caspida. As we look to invest in others, we’ve identified five attributes of companies to invest in: Proprietary access to data - the algorithms are off the shelf and available to everyone. Creating proprietary data through product usage, perhaps as an event-driven SaaS product, or through key partnerships is essential to creating sustainable competitive advantage. End to end applications, not platforms - the monoclouds are likely to win the ML-as-a-Service business. They have more researchers, lower costs of infrastructure, and far more marketing dollars than any startup. End-to-end applications offering revenue increases and/or cost reduction are much easier and a better path for a startup to go-to-market. Strong GTM enabled by ML - ML has the potential to be a technology innovation leading to a go-to-market advantage . By changing the way a buyer evaluates software and potentially reducing the cost of customer acquisition, ML based products can disrupt. But a technology innovation alone is not enough . Experts in the field - Yes, you can use the monocloud APIs out of the box. But those systems are tuned to be as broadly applicable as possible and generate pretty good results. To deliver an exceptional experience, a startup will need experts in speech recognition, natural language processing, or whatever their core discipline might be. Algorithmic advances - every once in a while, we may invest in a company with a fundamental algorithmic advance unlikely to be replicated elsewhere. Like the database and the graphical user interface before it, machine learning is a new enabling technology that will change the way we build and sell software broadly. And though the terms might be the zeitgeist of the day, rapidly becoming corporate cliché, the impacts of the technology are just starting to be understood and leveraged. Adapted from my presentation at Saastr.

One of the hardest thing to do in sales, especially for early stage SaaS companies, is to disqualify customers. When a startup disqualifies a customer, they turn away a revenue opportunity, a chance to add $1k of MRR or $3k of MRR, and meaningfully grow the top line. But if the customer isn’t the right customer, that incremental revenue bears a hidden cost. In the earliest days of the business, those potential customers waving checks promise an attractive revenue boost. Imagine a startup at $15k in MRR. A customer prospect worth $2k in MRR is a chance of growing monthly revenue by 13% in one shot. In addition, a seed stage or Series A startup typically has a narrow customer pipeline. Because the number of interactions is “rare,” each interaction with prospect seems precious. The business feels an urgency to grow, so the temptation to accept an non-ideal customer increases. In addition to these doubts non-ideal customer interest creates, there’s a personal dynamic at play. It’s a challenge as a salesperson to turn down a highly valuable prospect if they are outside the ideal customer profile (ICP). More business means better quota attainment, higher compensation, and not having to defend the question, “why did we turn away that Fortune 500?” A SaaS startup’s advantage is the speed of execution. Focusing on one customer segment, the ideal customer profile, reinforces the startup’s strength. Diffusing the customer focus negates it. But focus isn’t easy. Even if you’ve researched the market ahead of building a product, developed an ideal customer profile (ICP), the challenge arrives when you take the product to market. A unexpected surge of interest from a customer type raises the question, “Should we serve that market segment too?” “Was our initial research correct?” Inbound demand from a Fortune 500 precipitates excitement about winning an exceptional logo. Will that logo lead to inbound interest from others?  Managing that doubt is difficult. Nevertheless, the hidden costs of non-ICP customers are real. Changing a product roadmap to suit the needs of one big customer divides an already small engineering team. Managing a marketing message to several distinct customer bases scatters the brand. Higher customer success costs and churn rates from supporting non-ideal customers. Internally, questions arise about priorities. Having two ICPs creates interference across every department. Sometimes startups do need to change their ICP after they’ve launched and developed the product. Demand from an unexpected customer is real. If that’s the case, the decision should be deliberate and explicit to focus on that new segment in order to preserve focus on just one segment at the very earliest stages. The hard part is keeping the discipline of focusing on just one ICP, so the business doesn’t bear the hidden costs of non-ideal customers.

Advances in machine learning are transforming the software world. Two of the most exciting applications of machine learning are speech recognition and natural language processing. After researching the space for more than a year, we are thrilled to announce our investment in and partnership with Chorus , a pioneer in speech analysis for sales. Chorus has a unique technology that enables it to listen to inside sales phone calls and provide real-time feedback to salespeople while they are speaking on the phone. Chorus provides call transcription, keyword analysis for competitive tracking, among other features. Most important of all, Chorus understands what the best sales people do to close more business, and teaches everyone in a team to sell in that same way. Chorus CEO Roy Raanani cofounded the company with Dr. Micha Breakstone, an expert in the field. With their team, Roy and Micha will bring speech analysis to millions of account executives and help them beat their numbers more frequently and consistently. Readers of this blog know that speech recognition has been a personal interest of mine for several years. Most of these blog posts are dictated; same for my emails; and most of Winning with Data. We’ve reached the point that computers can understand human speech as well as other humans. Chorus’ innovation suddenly unlocks all the insight stored in human conversation, an enormous data set that’s almost entirely unleveraged today. The insights from speech analysis will fundamentally shift in the way we will sell, and companies like Marketo and Qualtrics are already benefitting from it. We’re very excited to partner with Roy, Micha, and the Emergence Capital team to bring Chorus’ breakthrough product and technology to sales teams.

Win probability charts like the one above have become the icons of popular predictive data analysis. I love data, but let me whisper a heresy to you. I detest these charts. I Instead of provoking thought, insight and questions, they close minds. They support the ideas of inevitability, of odds too great to overcome. Congratulations to the Patriots who faced a 99% probability of losing the game, but passed the ball down the field into the endzone twice, and rendered this fallacious prediction worthless. Another example for Nassim Taleb to use if ever he writes a sequel to the Black Swan . The problem with predictive analysis like this is they never capture all the variables. They don’t account for great players like Tom Brady can increase their level of play, the emotional swing of a team building momentum, those moments when people enter what Csikszentmihalyi called Flow . Predicting the future is damn hard, and no matter how much data we jam onto disk, or how sophisticated our adversarial neural networks become, we still won’t be able predict the future accurately. Just ask the weatherman who does it for a living. When I started in venture, I took a naive view that with enough data, I could filter and find great startups to invest in. At Google, I learned how powerful data can be. But almost nine years in, I see how fallacious that perspective is. I’ve done the analysis. You can find variables that correlate to success. You can increase or reduce the number of variables to examine. You can overfit models till you’re blue in the face. But predictive modelling will never capture exceptions. The models are based on the notion that they capture the typical outcome. What startup founder is typical? What startup journey is typical? All of them are outliers. In fact, every startup faces a chart like the one above. The odds are the business will fail. Two years ago, the two most exciting startups in enterprise might have had charts like the one above. One was a gaming company whose MMO didn’t succeed. But when the business launched its internal messenger, it became perhaps the fastest growing SaaS company ever. The second was a PaaS that was quite close to bankruptcy. The CEO decided to open source the code, and two years later it’s a key piece of every modern infrastructure stack. The most wonderful part about Startupland is the frequency with which enterpreneurs face predicted success charts and pull off a Tom Brady performance. Damn the win probability, full speed ahead. I’m very grateful to be able to witness some of those black swam performances because they inspire me every day. They remind me that the numbers are just numbers, and they change direction just as easily as the wind.

I met a physicist this week who told me all the Nobel laureates he had met in his studies have been the most modest of physicists. “They realize how small they are in the world, after discovering something incredibly special and new.”  Separately, I referenced an executive this week. A former colleague of this person told me," this is not a person who sees a model work once or twice, and instantly subscribes to the notion that it will work every time for every business." Those two conversations have me thinking about first principles thinking and modesty. They go hand-in-hand. To approach a problem with first principles, you have to set aside what you’ve learned about the problem or preconceived notions you might have. You have to tell yourself you know nothing about space or the business problem. Then, you have to become a student again, and learn as if it was the first time. This is how we discover secrets, the startup kind – the ideas you believe that very few others do. Opportunities to disrupt appear when a fundamental assumption about the world changes. For decades, data storage and compute was expensive. But today, it’s cheap and hugely scalable.  Legacy business intelligence vendors predicated their systems architecture on expensive data stores. Today, that is no longer true and a new architecture that leverages these database advances is better. That’s Looker’s opportunity. Several years ago, I heard Elon Musk speak at the D conference. When asked how he started SpaceX,  he related the story about how he couldn’t believe it was so expensive to launch a rocket. So he and his team began a bottoms up cost exercise to see exactly how much it would cost if they dated today. The carbon fiber, the titanium, the fuel (the constituent parts of rocket)  totaled only 2% of the current per rocket cost. Musk and his team discovered a that a fundamental assumption in the world of space was no longer true. It doesn’t cost that much to launch a rocket. There are many other examples of this. SaaS: Can software be sold over the Internet? Cloud infrastructure: Which enterprise will push all of their data on someone else’s servers?  In all of these cases, entrepreneurs  identified and believed that a fundamental assumption in the market had changed. And they seized the opportunity. Identifying these dislocations in market dynamics requires modesty and first principles. When market dislocations happen, the approaches that worked in the past won’t work in the future. Asking the critical questions about the implications of these changes enables us to hypothesize about to address the market in its new state.

Which is the more important priority? Growth or churn? Churn or growth? Early-stage companies have limited resources to focus their efforts. On one hand, growth is important in order to raise a venture capital round. Growth shows demand for a product. On the other hand, churn is a huge source of friction and raises questions of product market fit. Especially in the early stage, churn is the more important of the two priorities, and when founders ask me which to emphasize that the seed and series A, I’ll always respond churn. Churn is a limiting factor on the business. Like fiction, at some scale, churn will prevent the business from growing. To maintain the subscription revenue from the existing customer base requires ever greater mountains of cash. A $20 million ARR business losing 50% of its customers every year will have to replace $10 million worth of customers each year to achieve 0% growth.  Assuming 18 month payback, that’s $15M in sales and marketing spend.  That means the business will be fundraising constantly. Founder and early stage investors incentives are aligned to reduce churn as much as possible for five reasons. The first three are financial. First, there is additional fundraising risk at every turn because the sales and marketing costs are so high. The management team will be fundraising constantly. Second, each new round dilutes the existing shareholders, reducing the share of the company that is in employee hands, and reducing the return/multiple for investors. Third, the preference stack grows with each round. Preferred shares are typically paid their return first. The fourth and fifth reasons are operational. Fourth, each churn customer erodes the brand equity of the business. At some point, there might be thousands of former customers who have used the product and are talking about why they have left. That’s a challenging marketing obstacle to overcome. Fifth, high-churn is an indicator of imperfect product market fit. Pushing the business to grow on a product that isn’t exactly what the market demands might lead to a situation where the company has raised millions of dollars and needs to pivot. Pivoting a mid-stage startup is incredibly challenging because the company has to continue to show growth while transforming its business. There is a tension between serving old customers and moving the business to a new product and model. If instead, the startup focuses on achieving true product market early, the company will enjoy the benefits of a far more efficient sales model. Less capital required keeps more shares and company hands. Fewer churned customers implies a much healthier brand, further reducing acquisition costs. Last and most important, the business will have greater confidence in the direction it has chosen.

How much should a founder raise for their startup? I imagine almost every founder contemplating a fundraising round ponders this question. There are many different paths to developing an answer. The right answer that every startup founder has told me is as much capital as possible at the highest possible price. But what strategies exist to justify increasing the round size and consequently price? These are the three most common I’ve observed. Needs Analysis : the most important principle of fundraising is raise enough money to achieve a set of milestones that will attract a subsequent round of investment from new investors . The needs analysis technique puts this idea into action. In order to raise a great Series B, the company needs to be generating roughly $X00k in MRR. To be in that position, the business requires n account executives, y sales development representatives, z engineers and $Q millions of dollars in investment. Add 30% to $QM as a buffer, and that’s the size of the Series A. This is called reverse engineering your startup’s success , and a financial model is the best tool to project the future. Needs analysis justification is a powerful tool in negotiating with venture capitalists when discussing round size because it aligns incentives. A startup’s early investors would like to see the business raise a great follow-on as much as the founders. If everyone agrees on the milestones, the assumptions in the plan, then the round size is the round size. It’s a powerful justification of a round size because rationale is plain to see. Competitive Response: Bringing a knife to a gunfight isn’t a strategy that will sway many investors, candidates, journalists, or partners. If your startup is entering a market with several established competitors, you’ll need a sustainable competitive advantage to win disproportionate share. In addition, the startup will likely require at least as much capital as the competition, especially if the business is behind.  The perception of being financially under-resourced when competing directly may be a nearly impossible challenge to overcome. So, a certain raise size may be ‘required’ to enter the market with strength. In a similar vein, a large round at a high valuation  telegraphs a startup’s position to the market, warding off further competition. If you’ve raised $25M at $100M, and positioned your business as a leader in its segment, newer startups will face additional scrutiny and skepticism from early stage investors, wary of competing head on with an early (perceived) winner. Let the market decide: Sometimes, startups engender so much auction pressure that the market increases the company’s valuation and round size. This is a rare situation, but it can occur when the business has some exceptional attributes that distinguish it. We’ve benchmarked some of these companies in the past. Other strategies do exist. If you have one you’d like to add to the list, please send me a note. A topic for future post is determining how much capital is too much capital.

Over the last seven years, software startup investing has changed quite a bit. In 2010, classic SaaS was booming, the benefits of a subscription model were finally becoming clear to the public markets and the mass-market. Since then, many other types of software businesses have been created in new categories like agriculture technology and robotics. Which of these markets are growing the fastest for investment dollars? The chart above breaks out 14 different software categories and shows the amount of dollars invested in each category indexed to 2010 levels. In other words, if machine learning startups raised the same amount of money in 2016 is 2010, the chart would show a value of 1.  If those startups raised twice the amount of capital then the figure would be 2. Advertising technology has seen a resurgence in 2016, reversing a three year trend of declines. Agricultural Technology (AgTech) boomed in 2013, but has not recovered after substantial drop from its one-year high. Machine learning startups continue to raise ever more capital, as do big data companies. Cybersecurity investments are classic hockey stick. E-commerce companies may have fallen from their 2015 highs but are still raising four times as much capital as they were in 2010. A bit of shine may have come off Internet of things companies, while investors continue to pour money into marketing technologies despite the explosive growth in the number of competitors. The fastest growing relative to 2010 is robotics and drones who have witnessed 6000X growth relative to 2010 when there was effectively no investment. Classic SaaS investment relative to 2010 continues to grow, with now more than six times the dollars. ![image]( https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/indexed_investment_rounds_2017.png" width=100 However, the story is differ%/> However, the  story is different if we look at round counts.  Aside from machine learning and robotics, every single category of software investment has fallen in the number of rounds relative to their highs in 2015. There are fewer software startups raising capital in 2016 than 2015. We noticed this trend halfway through 2016 and the second half of 2016 did not Turn the trend around. Still, relative to six years ago, most categories of software are still at least 50% higher in round counts, even if they are coming of their highs. This is an interesting trend because venture capitalists raised roughly equivalent amounts of money in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Despite this increasing amount of capital on investor’s balance sheet, 2016 was a slower year by round count. And this data implies that fewer earlier stage companies raised, which means there will be fewer Series Bs in 2017 and fewer Series Cs in 2018. With lots of capital in hand, and fewer companies in the pipeline, the data suggests we will see increasing valuations in the next few years or a move up market, as VCs search for places to invest the large funds raised in the past three years.

Cisco announced yesterday it would acquire AppDynamics for $3.7B. We’ve analyzed AppDynamic’s growth and key metrics, because the business had filed its S-1 to go public . However, the management team and board changed plans and made history. By my estimate, AppDynamics is the fifth largest software acquisition in modern times. More astounding, the AppDynamics acquisition does set the absolute high water mark in one regard: acquisition multiple. It’s a very promising predictor of the 2017 M&A environment. Based on the S-1 filings from the business, a $3.7B price implies a 17.3x enterprise value/trailing twelve month revenue multiple, which is 41% higher than the next nearest acquisition, Salesforce/Demandware. There’s no comparable pricing event in the M&A market in the last 10 years. AppDynamic’s revenue growth is compelling, and as the chart above shows, only SuccessFactors was growing as quickly at M&A. However, SuccessFactors commanded a multiple of 11.0x, a distant cry from AppD’s 17x. In fact, there is no public metric that I can find to justify this massive premium over comparable acquisitions. Absolute revenue, gross margin, net income margin, cash flow margin, deferred revenue. I don’t know what happened behind the scenes, and some of it may be revealed in a future Cisco disclosure. But there are two conclusions we can draw. First, the process to acquired AppDynamics must have been incredibly competitive. Lots of auction pressure . Second, if this acquisition is any bellwether of the 2017 acquisition environment, it’s going to be a monster year. With 30-40 IPOs on the docket for 2017 - a staggeringly large class - many companies may choose AppD’s path of acquisition over going public, especially if they can command such an impressive premium. The median publicly traded SaaS company trades at 6x as of today. The AppDynamics multiple is nearly triple. At the top of the heap, Blackline and Shopify trade at 12-13x. If the government permits repatriation of overseas capital, and if the IPO schedule is as busy as projected, then 2017 is going to be a sensational year for acquisitions.

For the nine years I’ve been a venture capitalist, there’s always been a buzzword of the year. Solomo (social local mobile). Mobile-first. Realtime. Big data. 2016 was the year of machine learning. Is ML just another wave to crash and dissipate on the trough of disillusionment ? I don’t think so. In this rare case, I think hype is masking quite a bit of true technical innovation. During  last quarter of 2016, machine learning research has made huge strides. Computers now understand human speech as well as other humans. Computers can talk in a way that’s close-to-indistiguishable from true human speech. Computers can translate from one language to another, never having read the second language. Computers can generate new encryption schemes without human input. Computers can write captions to describe a given image. These innovations aren’t limited to the lab. Tesla’s self-driving car reduces crash rates by 40% and a brick-laying robot builds walls 3 times as quickly as a human. While some may groan that every pitch deck is littered with the words machine learning or artificial intelligence, I think each deck ought to be. Because over the next five to ten years, nearly every company will use machine learning in some form. Advertising optimization. Antifraud software. Intrusion prevention. Stock trading These first uses of ML in the 2000s reveal the characteristics of problems that benefitted from machine learning: frequently repeated processes whose decision-making could be measured, quantified and back-tested. And processes in which humans could determine which factors in the decision are important. The algorithmic advances in 2016 enumerated above broaden the range of applications for ML. With the right volumes and types data and processing power, computers can develop enough of an understanding to predict, optimize, segment or detect anomalies in many new domains like speech, like language generation, like image recognition, like natural language understanding, like image and music creation. And they can do it with far less human guidance than before. While the we may not yet be able to build many of the things we dream of in software, we’re getting much closer much faster. Startups are going to revolutionize existing software categories with ML, and they will create new categories of software with ML.

Over the last few days, I’ve been reading Shoe Dog, Phil Knight’s autobiographical tale describing the formation of Nike, and I think it might be one of the very best founding stories I’ve read. Easy to read, brimming with passion, full of harrowing business crises, the book is an inspiration to anyone who has a crazy idea and commits to persevering. At twenty-four I did have a Crazy Idea, and somehow, despite being dizzy with existential angst, and fears about the future, and doubts about myself, as all young men and women in their midtwenties are, I did decide that the world is made up of crazy ideas. History is one long processional of crazy ideas. The things I loved most— books, sports, democracy, free enterprise— started as crazy ideas. Originally called Blue Ribbon Sports, an importer of Onitsuka shoes, Nike is now a $88B company. Before Nike, jogging wasn’t a thing that most people did. Through force of will, enormous sacrifice, and ingenuity, Nike ignited the running movement. All the while, they faced constant bankruptcy challenges, lawsuits from Japanese suppliers, anticompetitive actions from their competitions. In Shoe Dog, Knight’s reveals his personality. He doesn’t respond to any of the thousands of letters from his top sales person. He demands two of his lieutenants switch places. He steals a document from a supplier’s briefcase and replaces it, stealthily. He calls his management offsite Buttfaces. In short, he isn’t shy about his idiosyncrasies or his mistakes. He intersperses the history of the business with observations and lessons from his journey. For example, Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results. But Shoe Dog isn’t a management book. It’s a founder’s story about how to persevere when things get tough again, and again, and again. Knight’s refrain throughout the story is a quote from General Douglas MacArthur. “You will be remembered for the rules that you break.” Shoe Dog has me asking the question, which of the rules do I want to break?  Which do you?

I’ve been struggling with the right way to enable commenting on this blog for a long time. In 2013, I wrote a post called Letter to the Editor about my challenges with comments. Most notably, comments meaningfully changed readers’ perceptions of the content they read, even if the comments are not sound. In addition, I haven’t found a way to effectively moderate comments at scale. Several months ago, I deployed a chat widget at the bottom off this page as an experiment. Here are my observations so far: Chat volumes are similar to commenting numbers. The amount of communication coming in through chat is roughly equivalent. The types of interactions are more personal. By their nature, chats are one-on-one. Chatters often write in with their points of view, ideas for new posts,  typographical errors to fix, or just saying hello. Often, the conversation ping-pongs a few times, which is fun. I do get a fair number of questions to the effect of,  “Is this actually you writing back?” It is. I haven’t received any tirades.  I find overall it’s much easier to manage than comments. I know the identities of the chatters and I can track their visitation patterns through the site. I hope to use that data to reach out to founders of startups and also to optimize content over time. Combining this data with email newsletter data gives me a much better sense of the composition of this blog’s audience than any other analysis. There’s a great benefit to having the chat history each time you interact with someone. It reminds me of great customer support tools that provide all the context you need to engage. I’m very sensitive to page load speed. My goal is less than 1 second to full page render and fortunately the chat widget loads asynchronously, maintaining fast page load times. Chat doesn’t build community in the same way as commenting. Since the chats are not public, readers cannot  comment on each other’s ideas. Rather, chatting is more one-on-one; more personal and direct. I imagine SaaS startups prefer chat to commenting in their content marketing efforts because the startup can exert tighter control over the prospect’s experience compared to a commenting platform.  A brand is the sum total of all interactions a customer has with the business. A prospective customer can engage with an SDR and be guided through the buying journey over several low-touch, personal conversations.  This establishes rapport early on with the company and reinforces the brand. Overall, I think it’s been a successful experiment but I’m curious to hear if readers and other content marketers have different impressions. Send me a note on Twitter or a chat at the bottom of the page.

Most SaaS companies dream of attaining the $100M ARR mark. The very fastest attain the goal in 6-7 years. Last week, Workday halted trading to announce it had signed Walmart as a customer. Brian White, research analyst at Drexel Hamilton investment bank, estimated this one customer could generate $100M-$200M per year for Workday in recurring revenue - a single customer. I couldn’t validate that this is the largest contract ever signed by a SaaS company, but if it is not the largest, it is most certainly the top 5. Workday beat SAP for the business. This monumental deal is a validation of SaaS products at the very largest scale both in terms of contract value but also the number of seats. There are not that many million subscriber businesses in existence. Intuit/QuickBooks Pro (about 5M). Adobe Creative Cloud (about 8M). Walmart employs more than 2.3 million people. Assuming about half of those employees use Workday, the software surpasses the million subscriber mark easily. The Workday/Walmart partnership also demonstrates scale of revenue shift possible in the upper reaches of the enterprise. A few years ago, we calculated there was $1.2 trillion worth of classical software market capitalization available to shift to SaaS. Like the melting arctic icecaps, this license revenue is calving, one customer at a time. SAP lost the bid. After reading about it, I have lots of questions. Is it truly a SaaS contract or is it a license software that’s managed by Workday? For Walmart,  a license software deal is better for taxes since they can depreciate the asset. How is the sales commission on a contract of this scale calculated? Is there a maximum amount paid to the team? How does a company manage a sales process like this? This almost certainly involved both CEOs spending time. How will the finance team aim to predict the future cash flows from the relationship? The finance team cannot have used it in their forecasts - a miss either way is a $100M swing. How should a professional service team be staffed and allocated to ensure customer success? How many people? How much time is required? What are the ultimate gross margins on the transaction? The Workday/Walmart deal is a behemoth, and it likely broke many internal processes like sales commission calculation, hiring forecasting and revenue forecasting.  how much or how many more deals of this size we will see, but the trend is inexorable. SaaS companies are winning monster accounts from incumbents. The image above is $100M in $100 bills relative to the size of an average human.

During my first few weeks at Google, I read through the internal resumes of my new colleagues, which detailed their work and promotion paths. Google promoted people quickly. Some college graduates who had distinguished themselves had been promoted every quarter for more than a year, and were managers, senior managers, even directors. And I wanted the same type of trajectory. So I resolved to work as much as possible to achieve it. At the outset, I began to take on other projects. Small things like an extra research project. Or helping a friend with a presentation. One day, when I thought we needed a basic CRM for our team, I stayed up late into the morning building one , called Toothpaste. Pretty soon, the extra work began to consume a lot more time. I began to sleep less, going to bed on consistently after midnight, sometimes sleeping only a few hours. I doubled down on productivity tools looking to do more in less time. I began to focus on reducing interruptions and tallied each time someone interrupted me. Amidst the growing workload, I wanted to keep up an exercise regimen similar to the one I had on the crew team at school. The earliest San Francisco to Mountain View bus arrived too late to work out for more than an hour to be in the office before 730. So when I happened to meet Marty, who ran the Google bus program, I asked if there might be an earlier shuttle. The next week, a bus began arriving at my Google bus stop around 4am. I would climb aboard and fall asleep in the back row. Somewhere along the way, we would stop to pick up one of the Google chefs, rising early to prepare breakfast. I might arrive around 5, workout for about 90-120 minutes and then back to my desk. Weekends I tried to catch up on sleep, but often, I worked most of Saturday and Sunday too. I was a flywheel spinning out of control. On Christmas Eve 2005, my family admitted me to the emergency room. Bacterial pneumonia. Everyone told me my lifestyle was unsustainable and it had to change. Especially my manager. This was the fourth time in four quarters that I had been to the ER. Since then, I’ve learned a few things about how to avoid burnout: I am responsible for setting boundaries. Work time, sleep time, family time, you time. If I don’t set them properly, things get unbalanced very quickly. Being productive isn’t about doing more and more in the same amount of time. It’s about doing only the most important things well. And either saying no to the other things or finding another way for them to get done. I can’t win a marathon by thinking of it as 26 mile long sprints, or a week as 5 day-long sprints. Loved ones are good judges of when things are in and out of balance, and in my case, my wife helped me find more balance. Taking time off is essential. Vacations, yes, but also nights and weekends. At the beginning of each year, I try to remember that feeling of being out of balance, of being in the hospital with pneumonia, to reflect on how I should be spending time this year. Which are the most important things I need to do well in 2017? And which things just aren’t?

Calendars contain one of the under-studied data sets within companies. How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives, wrote Anne Dillard. How we spend our days at work determines what we and the company ultimately achieve. I remember meeting Ryan Fuller of Volometrix several years ago. He shared the story of the business he and his colleagues had built analyzing the way companies spend their days. For one company, they tallied the annual hourly contribution of employees to support the three-hour weekly executive team meeting: it was something on the order 300,000 hours or about 150 person years. Quite an investment! In December, the Volometrix team published a report on What Great Managers Do Daily in HBR. This analysis substantiates the team dynamics that most people intuit already. First, great managers set the expectations of how much time the team should work. Second, great managers balance the workload across the team. Third, great managers maintain broad networks within their companies. Fourth, great managers spend more than 30 minutes every three weeks with their reports. More time is always better. The Volometrix insights originate from large companies. So do they apply to startups? The third point likely has a parallel in startups: great managers maintain broad networks within and across companies. I suspect the great benefit of a strong network is finding new opportunities to inspire and enthuse a team. All of the other points are immediately applicable to any business with managers. In fact, they extend to almost any team. Great teams share their workloads, spend time with each other, challenge each other to do better, and look for inspiration and opportunity from the outside. Is this how your startup’s management is spending its time?

The fundraising market is in flux. The data indicates that it is certainly reverting to the mean after two record years in 2014 and 2015. Late stage market dynamics are changing as  hedge funds and mutual funds seek other areas to invest. In 2017, there will be a lot of comparison between the prices public bound companies fetch at IPO compared to the last round private valuations as the public window opens. Given all that change, which early round will be the hardest to raise for founders in 2017? Let’s take a look at the Crunchbase data for US startups.  Seed rounds have seen the greatest growth since 2010 from approximately 1000 rounds per year to more than 4000 rounds per year in 2014. In 2016, they also saw the greatest drop, 37%, to about 2500. Series As and Bs counts grew 40% from their 2010 figures before falling 20% in 2016. They follow the same pattern, but not nearly to the magnitude of seed rounds. Median round sizes across the three different investment rounds all exhibit signs of inflation. Series Bs in particular have grown by 30% from  $10M to $15M median. Series As have grown steadily from $3M to $6.6M,  17% annual growth. Seed medians have tripled from $272k to $750k, the fastest of all, at 25% per year. If we examine total dollars invested in each round, Series Bs reached nearly $15 billion in 2015. Notably, series B dollars have roughly equalled Series A dollars until the 2014-2015 bull market. The data suggests a reversion to the mean after a period when Series B dollars exceeded Series A by 30%. This data suggests Series Bs may become harder to raise on a relative basis than other rounds. The aggregate amount flowing in the stage is falling the most in gross dollar terms and relative to Series As. Let’s see how the ratio of Series B to Series A dollars has changed over time. In 2010, there were 1.4 Series B dollars for every 1 Series A dollar. That coverage ratio declined through 2013 when the ratio touched 0.88. In 2016, the ratio is 1.22. Not a seven year low by a long stretch. So, there does seem to be plenty of Series B dollars for all the Series A startups who will be in market this year. If we run the same analysis for Series A and Seed rounds, we observe a different phenomenon. Relative to Seed investments, the amount of Series A dollars available has increased steadily by about 4% per year from 2012 through 2016. So, which is the hardest round to raise in 2017? One argument is the seed round, because the number of rounds has seen the greatest decline and the 18% y/y drop in investment in 2016 is a sharp correction. However, the data suggests the harder rounds will be the Series B. The aggregate amount of financing is falling the most gross dollar terms (23% from its highs), and the coverage ratio of Series A dollars is declining. In addition, as Series A round size continue their steady growth, the expectations of Series B companies will increase in lockstep. 2017 isn’t the hardest Series B market of the 2010s. That distinction belongs to 2013 and 2012. Despair not,  despite the vacillations of the market there’s near record-levels of capital out there to finance startups. Even if 2017 is a bit off the highs of 2014 and 2015.

Founded in 2008, AppDynamics is a leader in the application performance management space. AppDynamics technology helps engineers determine how software applications behave as users interact with them. Based in San Francisco, AppDynamics employs about 1200 people and has raised approximately $315M to date. The company filed their S-1 recently to take the company public. Let’s look at some of the key metrics and then compare AppDynamics to NewRelic, a close competitor which went public in late 2014. AppDynamics generates revenue three ways. They sell their APM software as a perpetual software license in addition to a subscription (SaaS). Also, they offer professional services to their clients. The company provided full year data through 2016. For 17, the S-1 contains the first nine months of data, so it shows a decline. AppD has grown from $18.9M to $42.9M to $87.3M in revenue through 2016. The SaaS product has always generated more revenue than license, but the two revenue items did contribute similar revenues in 2015, at which point the company seems to have decided to focus actively on selling SaaS. A key element of SaaS growth is AppD’s ability to command larger contract values: The increase in subscription revenue was primarily due to a 20% increase in active customers, and an increase in average subscription revenue recognized per active customer of 51% to approximately $56,000 in the nine months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to approximately $37,000 in the nine months ended October 31, 2015. License software is going in the other direction: License revenue in the nine months ended October 31, 2016 decreased by $2.2 million, or 6%, compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2015, primarily due to a 30% decrease in the average transaction size, partially offset by a 35% increase in the number of perpetual license transactions. This chart shows the revenue contribution of each product line in percentage terms. There are three interesting trends. First, Subscription generated 80% of the revenue in 2014. AppDynamics subscription revenue has three parts: time-bound licenses (42% of last 9 months’ revenue), SaaS (38.6% of revenue), and maintenance (19.8% of revenue). Second, license revenue jumped in 2015 to 41% of revenue and has fallen every year since. AppDynamics has typically sold in the upper-mid-market and enterprise markets, where licensing software remains common. But over time, the data indicates the company has had more success with SaaS and/or deliberately shifted to SaaS. Third, professional services revenue is growing as a share of revenue. This could be because AppDynamics is serving larger customers who are willing to pay for greater services, customization and training, or because the ongoing support at customers as they growth the product is increasing with time. The gross margins are excellent. License revenue doesn’t bear the cost of sales SaaS products do (servers and bandwidth). So the margins are nearly 100%. The SaaS margins are terrific at greater than 77%, which is much higher than the publicly traded median of 71%. 2017 GM seems to be much improved year-to-date at 85%. Professional services margin has improved steadily, and is now at -34% meaning one dollar of PS revenue costs $1.34 to provide. This PS margin falls in line between Hortonworks and Marketo at the lower end of the spectrum. Let’s look at profitability and cash flow. AppDynamics burned $41.3M in cash in 2016 on $150M in revenue, or about 28% of revenue. The business is closing the gap to cash-flow-break-even. There’s a similar story  about profitability, with a loss of $134M in revenues. According to a 2015 analysis, most SaaS companies attain a -10% net income margin and a 0% cash flow margin right around year six. AppDynamics may take some more time to get there, but it’s on the right path. Company ARPC at IPO APPD 76,000 NEWR 6,000 Let’s compare AppDynamics to New Relic. One of the most important differences between the two is go-to-market strategy. New Relic pursues a bottoms-up strategy, targeting developers and smaller accounts. AppDynamics employed a top-down strategy. This difference is reflected in the greater than 10x difference in the average revenue per customer at IPO between the two companies. Another important difference is the nature of the revenue. The majority of AppDynamics software revenue is license, both perpetual and timed, whereas New Relic’s revenue is predominantly SaaS. We can see that the two companies have very similar revenue curves, although AppDynamics is offset by one year. It was also founded about a year later. The growth rates of the businesses as they approach IPO are quite similar. And the account expansion figure are 123% (AppD) vs 124% (NewR), statistically identical. The subscription gross margins of the two businesses are very similar. New Relic’s is about five percentage points higher. Note, I’m only taking into account AppD’s SaaS revenue line. In summary, these two companies have approached the same market from different angles and though there are some differences like license revenue vs pure subscription and markedly variant ARPCs; the core businesses of each are quite similar in margin profile. Some may point to the fact that New Relic raised about $100M less before IPO than AppDynamics, but looking at the balance sheets, it’s a wash. New Relic had $20M in the year of the IPO and AppD will have $120M. This analysis serves as a great reminder that there are many ways to build exceptional SaaS companies. In this case, both bottoms up and top down were successful paths to becoming dominant players in the application performance management space.

The end of the year is fast approaching. Time for some quantitative analysis of the content that readers liked the best this year. 2016 was a year of change for SaaS, and most of the story was the public market. Valuations there fell from their highs in 2014. More than $70B of public SaaS market cap was taken private by both other publics and also by private equity firms. SaaS company formation seems to be slowing, but the companies that do raise, command larger Series As than ever. Through the evolution of the market, these were the top 6 posts of the year The Hottest Startup Sectors In 2016 - published on January 3rd, this post reviewed the patterns of investment in startups, and in particular, the sectors where investors were increasing their investment the fastest. The data indicated education, big data, marketplaces and SaaS were the leading categories. Next month, I’ll write a retrospective analysis to see how those predictions fared. How Your Startup’s Org Chart Changes Your Product - this post discusses Conway’s Law:  “The products software teams created reflected their organizational structure.” In other words, the code we write and the way we build our products is intrinsically reflected in how we build the company. Does your startup have the right structure for the product it’s building? The Next Big Shift In SaaS and Event Driven SaaS are two related posts. The first post sketched the idea and the second filled in the details of one theory on how startups will disrupt their incumbents, and particularly the dominant systems of record. Namely, startups will focus on workflows and collect data generated by those workflows, which is a very different way of doing work than most SaaS products promote today. There are Only 3 Pricing Strategies for Your Startup - Because pricing is so complex, ever-changing and unique to each company, the taxonomy in Monetizing Innovation is a relief. It distills pricing intricacies into three strategies, and helps us clearly articulate the pricing strategy of the business. And that helps with matching price to the other 3 Ps of marketing . Thank you to all of you who read these posts, send comments and ideas. It’s been a wonderful 2016 and I’m looking forward to another exciting year in 2017.

Australia, Canada, Israel, China, India. SaaS startups are thriving in these countries and many more. Next generation software companies hail from many different parts of the world, and some of them are worth billions of dollars. Shopify and Hootsuite in Canada. Atlassian in Australia. Xero in New Zealand, just to name a few. As these successful startups have boomed, how has the early stage fundraising market for them evolved? According to Crunchbase data, US SaaS investment has grown tremendously since 2010 from about $1.5B per year to $7B. 2016 has dropped a bit, which is likely due to both the environment and that not all the data has come in for the year. Ex-US (or non-US) SaaS investment has grown 6.3x over the same time period,  an encouraging data point for SaaS founders. Breaking down the data by country, we can see that outside of the US there is a lot of volatility, but the secular trend is an increasing amount of SaaS investment in the eight countries depicted above: Brazil, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, India, Israel. The median Series A varies by geography. In Brazil, it’s about $2M. Meanwhile, Israel spiked to more than six million dollars, similar to France and Germany. Canada’s SaaS environment seems to be the most similar to the US in terms of stability and round size.  There can be many different reasons for volatility. The  fundraising environment differs geography by geography. Terminology may differ considerably as well. At some point however we should expect that always figures converge. A SaaS startup by any other name (or in any other geo…) Looking at the data by the number of investments, we see a more encouraging trend of secular growth in almost every single geography. Again, not all of the 2016 data has been recorded. But there’s no doubting it. SaaS is a global trend. The most exciting part about international SaaS startups is that they will identify opportunities that are unique to their geographies that currently haven’t been addressed by existing software companies. In some cases, those unique approaches and solutions can grow to global scale. It’s just the beginning for the software companies and 2016 marks agree another great year for these founders as the financing environment continues to grow and support their needs. The US still remains by far the largest fundraising market for software businesses. But increasingly, we are seeing a pattern of international SaaS companies raising an initial round in their home countries and then raising a subsequent round to come to the US. There often to rationale for this. Building a go-to-market team that targets the US and being able to access a larger financing ecosystem. SaaS is truly a global phenomenon and one that will continue to upend the software world for a long time to come.

SaaS startups often find themselves in one of three different states when contemplating their burn rate. The first is the David Farragut strategy. Damn the burn rate, full speed ahead.  The second is the conservative approach -  attaining profitability using only the cash on the balance sheet.  Those two are easy. Circumstances dictate the respective aggression or conservatism. Lots of cash or not so much.  The more complicated state is the one in between, and that is the one that most SaaS startup operate within. You have a SaaS startup. You spent the last 18 months or so building a product on a ramen diet. You might have 6 to 8 employees. A handful of customers are starting to indicate they are willing to pay for the product. Or a content marketing campaign has resulted in a deluge of inbound customer leads. Or your startup might be a series A company that ostensibly attained product market fit. But it turned out the market for the product wasn’t big enough. Or the fit wasn’t true, a bit of a mirage. You might be in any other number of situations where you are wondering when is the right time for me to increase my burn rate? After all, the startup has limited cash. If you aim to raise another venture round, you’ll want to invest that cash wisely, when the time is right, to achieve the maximum growth rate possible in the shortest amount of time. No one can answer the question of when precisely the right time is to begin marketing in earnest or scaling the sales team by hiring account executives and sales development reps. But there are some leading indicators that suggest it could be the right time to invest. First, customers are pulling you into the market. They are so excited about the product, they are doing unnatural things like accelerating the sales cycles, asking for but ignoring security audits, escalating the decision to the CEO very quickly. Second, you can clearly articulate a sales process to someone who is unfamiliar with the business because you have done it 10 or 20 or 30 times. There is a pattern to each of these engagements that you have discovered and can now be repeated. Third, the business is generating enough leads to fill the hopper of an account executive and ensure high quota attainment. Somewhere in the range of 6 to 7 times the quota of the AE. Fourth, your payback period is quite short. The payback period is the number of months of gross profit required to pay off the cost of customer acquisition. According to PacCrest’s 2016 survey,  the median is 18 months . Anything around 12 months indicates that paid acquisition is a very viable channel and merits more investment. Fifth,  there is a substantial amount of competition in the market, and in order to keep up, investment becomes table stakes. Without a significant push,  the business risks becoming an also-ran. This is not a comprehensive list, but a collection of different scenarios that I’ve come across when meeting with founders of SaaS startups. Everyone has a different risk appetite, sense of their market, and ultimate plan for their business. As we’ve seen in profiling lots of different size companies there are almost an infinite number of ways of building an enormous company, from Atlassian to Workday. If you see some of these signs in your startup, think deeply about whether it’s time to invest more in the company’s growth.

Sales leaders consistently underinvest in sales team training and development . As SaaS startups scale, sales execution becomes the most tangible metric of a business’ success, and the one by which the business’ health is benchmarked. Not to mention how the head of sales is evaluated. When is the right time to invest in sales training? And how much should a business invest? Let’s take a hypothetical SaaS company with five sales reps, each with a $750k quota. Four of the team members attain 70% of their quota each month. But one of the account executives sets the standard. She closes $900k, booking 120% of her quota. It’s quite common to see a distribution of account executive performance resembling this one. Training aims to narrow the gap by spreading best-practices across the team. One study found a 12% improvement in prospect close rates after training. Let’s assume after training this team improves close rates by 10%, which translates directly into a 10% increase in bookings. Before the training, the team books $3.0M annualized (750k x 70% attainment x 4 reps + 900k), and after it books $3.3M annualized. A $300k increase. At a 70% gross margin, the training generates an incremental $210k in gross profit. An economist might argue the business should be willing to spend $209k for the training - every marginal dollar is worth it! But in reality, it’s much more likely to be willing to spend a quarter or a fifth of the gains,  about $40k-50k, to justify the return-on-investment after transaction costs, lost time spent selling, and other factors. For sales teams with sizable numbers of account executives, good sales training can save the cost of hiring a new account executive. Imagine our hypothetical startup’s sales team grows to 20 people. On average, they attain 70% of their quotas for a total bookings run rate of $10.5M (750k x 70% x 20). A 10% improvement is a $1.05M addition to the bookings, which is just about 2x the bookings capacity of a current rep. At this scale, the economics of sales training are plain to see: less headcount required to attain the same bookings run rate. Of course, there are many factors to consider when evaluating sales training. What will the true gains in productivity be? How frequently should we train our reps? Which training system should we use? What is the impact to lost productivity during the training? Each startup will have to decide their own strategy. However, as books like Predictable Revenue written which explicates the sales productivity strategies of Salesforce, and the math above shows, the impacts in sales training can be very important contributors to more consistent efficient growth - a win-win for SaaS startups.

What is your SaaS startup worth in an acquisition? To answer that question, we can analyze the data set of all software companies acquired over the last six years and benchmark them by enterprise value-to-revenue multiples. What is your SaaS startup worth in an acquisition? To answer that question, we can analyze the data set of all software companies acquired over the last six years and benchmark them by enterprise value-to-revenue multiples. The enterprise value or EV is the price the company sold for, minus the cash on its balance sheet. Not every EV/Revenue multiple is known, but this data set can provide us some directional guidance on how the market has changed. The chart above shows the median multiple across all software acquisitions. It has varied between 3x and 4x and declined over the last three years. This figure takes into account all acquisitions, including old and slow growing software companies. If we break apart the data set by quartile, we see the dispersion of the multiples better. The median premium companies are fetching between 6x-7x trailing revenues. In 2013, acquirers paid the highest multiples for premium companies at more than 8x. Since then, the public market has vacillated, SaaS multilpes fell by 57% and are now slowly reverting to the mean. In parallel, buyer willingness to pay has decreased and kicked up, as we projected earlier this year . If we look at the maximum multiple attained by year, we see a similar pattern. 2013 was a banner year, followed by a steep drop in 2015 and a slight recovery in 2016 at 11.5x. 2016 has been a year of public companies acquiring other public companies; and private equity firms taking private large software companies. We haven’t yet seen material consolidation of SaaS startups, which may take place in 2017. EV/Revenue multiple is a composite metric. There are many underlying figures that influence it including growth rate, management team, competitive differentiation, strategic importance to the buyer. And of course, if founders develop the right auction pressure, then sometimes acquirers can be pushed north of these ranges.

For hundreds of startups in the as-a-service world, the scores of product launches at last week’s Amazon Web Services Reinvent Conference each were a warning shot across their bows. We are coming. We are coming right after you, with tens of billions of dollars on our balance sheet, hundreds of salespeople, and the broadest suite of software and infrastructure since Oracle. Anything that’s open source with traction, we will host. Any business where we see margin is our opportunity. We are coming fast and hard. At least, that’s the way I interpreted it. Amazon isn’t the only monocloud. I heard this term from a founder recently. I couldn’t tell if it meant a singular cloud that could satisfy all a customer’s needs; or monopolistic cloud that will consume all. Perhaps it’s a clever portmanteau because both meetings are equally apt. But getting back to the point, Amazon isn’t the only monocloud. Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce each are building broad platforms that serve hundreds of thousands of developers and are generating tens billions of dollars in aggregate revenue and growing at incredible rates. All of these businesses have some pretty powerful advantages they are using to compete. First, the companies behind them have bolstered these businesses with billions of dollars from their balance sheets. Second, these dollars finance hundreds if not thousands of engineers are working on developing new products at a torrid rate. The list of new product announcements from Amazon Reinvent underscores that point. Third, because of the freedom extended by the two most popular open source licenses these infrastructure vendors can host successful open source projects without constraint. And because of their scale, they can do it at a fraction of the cost by the startup would. Fourth, all of these companies are building substantial sales teams to sell through their existing channels and also develop new customer relationships. Within many large customers, these infrastructure providers already have substantial billing relationships and product penetration. Fifth, there are very real advantages to using multiple services from a single platform vendor. Integration is easier. This simplifies the task of an account executive upselling or cross-selling. From their infancy through their adolescents, these monoclouds played primarily in the infrastructure world: databases, hosting, compute, storage. But now they’re moving into applications. Microsoft’s PowerBI and Amazon’s Quicksight are forays into business intelligence. Microsoft announced the launch of Jupyter notebooks this morning, a push to supply an application to the millions of data scientists. AWS listed business productivity category on their product page which includes collaboration tool to compete with Box and a hosted email product to compete with Gmail and Outlook. Amazon released a mobile analytics product. I could go on. In addition, all of these monoclouds invest aggressively in commercializing research. This oligopoly on machine learning talent releases advances faster than any start up could. A computer achieves human parity in speech comprehension. Speech recognition model three times faster than typing. Photography apps that recognize locations and objects within their own photographs, or can trace people through their lives as they age. Plus with advances like Google’s TensorFlow Processing Unit, custom silicon for processing machine learning models, the incumbents’ advantage shows no signs of waning. What is this all mean for startups?  Building a web application that’s a view on a database, the characteristic features of a first-generation SaaS company, won’t cut it anymore. At some point, these monoclouds will build or buy a competitive version and cross sell their way into the market. Now that everyone has access to similar speech recognition, speech generation, image recognition, anomaly detection, and other deep learning algorithms, the algorithms themselves are not much of a competitive barrier to entry either. Plus, all the technologies are going to continuously improve. For a while, startups might play the on-prem vs in the cloud security cat-and-mouse game. And they might win the battle with that strategy, but they’ll lose the war. Cloud migration is an inexorable trend. Last, the “I have the biggest balance sheet strategy” won’t work the way it did when startups were the main competition. The monoclouds coffers will dwarf most others. In short, defensibility matters more than ever. Startups will have to understand their markets better and leverage their ingenuity. They will likely have to pick a niche that the broad generalized platforms won’t pursue. For example,  the speech recognition algorithms provided by the monoclouds will be optimized for generic use cases, not medical, not legal, or other vernaculars. Startups will have to find new distribution strategies. They will also have to make the case that a constellation of best-of-breed point solutions trumps the ease-of-use of a suite.  perhaps, they will also make use of more restrictive licenses like the GPL family of licenses. And, they must capitalize on the fear that monoclouds are now engendering in their biggest customers: lock-in. image credit: Don Hammond

In June, Frank Bien and I published our book, Winning with Data . It describes through case studies how some of the most successful startups use data to create sustainable competitive advantage. Since then, we’ve sold thousands of copies. Today, we’re releasing an Audible version of the book . I have 8 free copies to give away to readers. If you’d like to throw your hat in the ring for one of the codes, please answer a one question survey about SaaS startups . I’ll select 8 respondents at random and send out the codes next week. Just a reminder that you’ll need an Audible account to claim the code. It’s been wonderful to see the reactions to the book. Thanks to everybody who’s supported the effort.

Bookings, MRR, Revenue. All these metrics form part of the financial statements of SaaS companies. For as long as SaaS companies have existed, we’ve used one way of counting revenue, called GAAP. Starting in 2017, revenue recognition for SaaS companies will change, and SaaS startups will have more flexibility in the way they record revenue than in the past. BDO has published the clearest summary of these changes , which number more than 750 pages in the tax code. Your accountant or CFO is the best person to consult about these changes. Public companies must transition to these new regulations starting in 2017. Private companies have the option to migrate to these new standards in 2017. They are obligated to comply in 2018. Startups may want to consider moving to this new reporting standard sooner because many of the new provisions allow startups to recognize revenue sooner. For example, professional services revenue can now be recognized as soon as the services are being provided, rather than at the end of the engagement or amortized over the contract. Also, SaaS companies can recognize revenue before a contract has been signed by their legal counsel, if the contract won’t be materially changed before the attorney signs. Sales and marketing expenses can also be treated differently. Startups have the option to record those expenses, which include commissions, during the month they were incurred. Or they can amortize those costs over the life of the customer contract. The combination of recognizing revenue sooner with the ability to amortize/spread out the costs of customer acquisition over the life of the contract may increase the company’s net income/profitability. As the industry moves to these new standards, public company reporting and benchmarks will change. Early stage companies should research the implications for their businesses to determine if the regulation, called ASU 2014-09 has ramifications for their revenue recognition practices. I am not an accountant. These observations come from reading summaries of the implications from Deloitte , E&Y, Grant Thornton , Moss Adams and PWC among others. Please consult an accounting professional for advice about your business.

As a SaaS startup begins to reach critical mass, the business generates more of its revenue from upsells and expansions, reaching about 30% at between $40-75M in revenue, which is in line with some of the models we’ve created . Many times startup teams ask how to compensate a sales team for renewals and upsells. The 2016 PacCrest Survey contains a wealth of information about these types of go to market questions. SaaS companies benefit from great efficiencies when they market to their existing customer base. In addition to mitigating churn, startups spend 2-10x less on acquiring a marginal ARR dollar when expanding and upselling accounts. This figure is called the cost of customer acquisition (CAC) ratio. Sales Type Median CAC Ratio 25% Percentile CAC Ratio New Customer 1.13 1.50 Upsell 0.27 0.75 Expansion 0.20 0.51 Renewal 0.13 0.32 I’ve reproduced this chart from the 2016 PacCrest report. For the median SaaS company, a new ACV dollar costs $1.13. The 25th percentile is a upper marker for the businesses with higher CAC ratios and it’s $1.50. Upsell, enticing buying a more expensive version or add-ons, costs twenty-seven cents per revenue dollar. Expansions, when the buyer purchases more seats for example, costs twenty cents per revenue dollar, and renewals is thirteen cents per revenue dollar. Familiarity is a major factor in reducing costs for the marginal sale to an existing customer. The buyer and the seller have built a relationship underpinned by trust and bolstered by experience working together for some time. The expansion or renewal is the second time the buyer is purchasing from the seller, so procurement processes are clear. Third, the internal dynamics should be easier since a successful software deployment should have established several internal champions. This familiarity decreases sales cycles and increases success rates, improving the economics. How should SaaS startups compensate their sales teams for upsells and expansions? According to the survey, the median commission rate on upsells is the same as new sales at roughly 7-8% of ACV (annual contract value). About 60% of those surveyed pay full commission on renewals and expansion, which is up 10 percentage points since last year, indicating this payout structure may be evolving into an industry standard. In the case of renewals, again 60% of startups pay commission, but 3% of ACV instead of the 8%. Those are all figures for annual deals. Multi-year deals, less common in SaaS than with traditional software, tend to present a challenge to startup teams. What’s the best way to compensate sales teams? Only 11% of SaaS businesses pay full commission on multi-year deals, preferring instead to pay a kicker (30%) or nothing at all (33%). There’s much more great data within the survey, too. Happy customers buy more products, remain customers longer and enable SaaS startups to scale rapidly and efficiently. Developing the sales motions, customer success sophistication and compensation structures to enable this type of growth is an essential skill of enduring SaaS businesses.

Earlier this week, I published benchmarks on [What Percentage Of Revenue Should SaaS Startups Spend On operating expense?]( http://tomtunguz.com/how-much-should-spend-on-operating expense/) Several founders asked to see this data broken down further. What fraction of operating expense is spent on sales & marketing, and what fraction of op is spent on engineering? Most businesses spend 2x more on sales & marketing than engineering. Looking at all publicly traded SaaS companies for four years before and four years after their IPOs, we see they spend about 40% of their operating expense on sales and marketing. The smaller gray lines plot each individual company. There are two outliers at the bottom, Xero and DealerTrak. These companies both went to market through distribution channels (accountants and car dealerships), resulting in very efficient growth. Both of these companies stopped reporting selling and marketing expenses around their IPOs. Aside from those two, the remainder of the basket operate between 20-60%, with a median of 40%. Box, 2U, Splunk, LogMeIn, Cornerstone, and MobileIron all spent more than 55% of operating expense on sales & marketing at some point. These companies span price points and industries, indicating that this ratio is likely driven more by management than a market. Engineering receives about 17% of operating expense for the median SaaS company. At the high end, companies like Atlassian and Castlight have spent more than 40% of their operating expense on engineering. At the low end, 2U, Fleetmatics, and Vocus spend less than 10%. Again, quite a bit of variance across industries and ACVs. So, how do these figures translate to numbers? According to Indeed data, an account executive in San Francisco earns $87k per year on average, while a software engineer earns $121k . Those figures imply most software businesses have roughly 3-4:1 sales/marketing to engineering ratio at scale. At the very outset of a startup, engineering typically outnumbers sales. At the Series A, it’s quite common to see teams of 7-10 engineers and one sales person. As the business scales to a Series B, the startup may have brought those ratios closer to equality with 20 engineers and 10-15 sales people. By the time the business reaches Series C, sales teams typically begin to outnumber the engineers.

Imagine you’ve just been named the head of a bustling New York City restaurant challenged by one issue - customers complain about the customer service. A data-driven person, you search for a metric to evaluate the current customer service to validate the complaint and then track as you experiment with the restaurant’s operations. What metrics would you employ? You might run a survey of customers at exit. You could follow with customers by telephone the day after the meal. You might ask finance to tabulate the tip amount as a percentage of the total bill and aggregate by waiter. These are fine metrics, but they share one common problem. They are lagging indicators of customer service. By the time these metrics have been tracked, it’s too late to correct the experience customer. Just how important is latency to making operational decisions? To explain, I’m going to share a memory from business school. There’s a game students at most business schools play called the Beer Game, which was invented at MIT Sloan School. Our marketing professor divided the class into four groups, for each of the key four parts of the beer production value chain: brewer, bottler, distributor and retailer. It’s a turn based game, and each turn the four groups chose how much to brew, bottle, distribute and stock. Our professor played the part of the customer and told the retailer how many bottles he would buy. Latency is a key wrinkle in the game. Players pass demand and supply information through pieces of paper, but upstream demand and downstream orders are delayed by two weeks. Demand oscillates in very small amounts. The retailer, acting on slow information, overcorrects just a little bit. Then the distributor overreacts just a little bit more; the same for the bottler. And the brewer is pulling out his hair when sales boom one week and go into total freefall the next. It happens every time, and it’s because the value chain’s data suffers from latency. It’s called the Bullwhip Effect because small changes on one end of the value chain create huge disruption on the other. The same idea holds for a startup. The four key parts of the value chain are product, marketing, sales and customer success. If there’s a lot of latency between the time a customer provides feedback and it reaches product management or marketing, there’s a potential to overcorrect and waste a lot of time and energy. How do you solve this latency issue? With a proxy metric. Getting back to the restaurant example, a simple way of evaluating customer service is to measure how full water glasses are. Ask the hostess to walk the aisles, and tabulate the fraction of water glasses at each table that are less than half full. It’s not a perfect measurement, but it’s a great leading indicator that several waitstaff are paying attention to the table. Proxy metrics are powerful for four reasons. They are easy to measure. They are correlated to (and ideally predictive of) the business’ goals They are concrete and create a unifying vision for the team They enable businesses to iterate faster by reducing latency Great companies employ proxy metrics all the time. If a new Facebook user creates 7 friends in 10 days, they’ll be a long term user. The more engagement minutes a customer spent digging through their data in Looker during a trial, the greater the likelihood they convert to a paid customer. At ThredUp, the world’s largest online consignment store, buying products both on web and a mobile application usage indicates high customer lifetime value. If a user creates an expense policy on Expensify, there’s a very high chance a company will buy the product. How do you find proxy metrics for your business? There’s no shortcut. Andrew Chen has written a blog post describing how to do it, step by step. Define the goal, explore the data, run a regression and then backtest. For more complex behaviors, like a network effect, you may need to find another statistical modeling technique. Proxy metrics are powerful because they enable businesses to use an upstream-metric to predict a downstream outcome, which reduces latency and accelerates experimentation cycle times. Faster experiments means discovering the right growth strategies sooner, and that’s a critical competitive advantage for every startup. Thanks to Lloyd Tabb, who inspired this post

What percentage of revenue should be spent on payroll? In 2001, Salesforce spent $35.6M on payroll  and generated $5.4M in revenue. NetSuite spent $38M on payroll generated $17M in 2004. as both of these companies scaled and approached IPO, the operating expense ratio (OER) or operating expense divided by revenue, asymptotes to 0.8. For every dollar of revenue, both of these companies spent $0.80 in payroll at scale. The OER is a metric of efficiency. How many salary dollars does a business invest to generate one dollar of revenue. The lesser the OER, the more technology leverage the startup can exacts. If the greater the OER, the greater the reliance of the business on employees to scale revenue. Looking at all publicly traded companies, we see quite a few outliers. Hortonworks, Xero, Castlight and DemandWare spent 4x, 7x or 11x their revenue on payroll at some point in their trajectories. In the cases of services-dependent software, companies may have to ramp payroll before being able to recognize income, thus pushing the OER higher. Other businesses may have very high OERs because they have amassed a large enough balance sheet to finance larger operations. In still other cases, big customers may have paid upfront and cash might be coming in, but again revenue recognition depresses revenue. Let’s exclude the outliers and look at the core. Just a reminder about box plots. The white line in the middle of each box is the median. The top and bottom parts of the box are 25th and 75th percentile. The whiskers extending from the box indicate the maximum and minimum that are within 2 standard deviations of the mean. The little dots are outliers. The median public SaaS company spends 140% of revenue on payroll 4 years before IPO and slowly decreases the ratio to 125% during the year of IPO. How does this apply to early stage companies? Businesses without revenue have infinite OER, which isn’t very useful at all during the earliest stages. At the Series A, a venture-backed SaaS startup in the Bay Area with $1M in revenue is likely employing somewhere around 20-40 people, and spending $3-4M per year on salaries, implying an OER of 3 to 4. At the Series B, the business might be at $5M in ARR with 80-120 people and spending about $14M on salaries, again producing an OER of around 3. But there isn’t much publicly available data at these earliest stages because public companies aren’t typically required to disclose these figures. But as a company scales, the benchmarks become clearer.

A few weeks ago, I had my first customer support experience of the future. I was in a meeting when my Android’s caller ID told me American Express was calling. I stepped of the conference room and answered the call. A machine-generated woman’s voice identified itself as the American Express fraud department. “Do you have a bluetooth headset or headphones you can use with your phone?” she asked. I replied that yes, I did. She said to tell her when I was ready. So I plugged in my headphones and said, “Ready.” Then she asked if she could send me a link to a website by SMS. “Yes.” The message came and I clicked on the link. The browser rendered an American Express page that asked me to log in. She prompted, “Please log into your account.” I signed in. Then she began to explain that the fraud department had identified two transactions as potentially suspicious. She said, “those two transactions are listed on your phone. Could you examine them and mark each one as fraudulent or not.” I clicked into each one and as I did, the voice began to read the key highlights of the screen. The date of the transaction. The vendor’s name. When I clicked Not Fraudulent, she said something to the effect of “let’s review the next one.” After I had indicated both transactions were mine, she said “Thank you, and have a nice day.” It was truly remarkable. Why did it feel so different than a traditional customer support call? First, because the bot on the other end of the line was on the same screen as I was. She instantly “knew” where I was clicking and what the right next step would be. She guided me at every turn. The robot understood the context, in contrast to a typical support call with requires several frustrating minutes to get on the same page as a customer service rep: “What is your account number?” “What is your security word?” “What seems to be the problem?” “I’m sorry I don’t quite understand what you’re asking for.” And so on. Second, the software presented me with all the information I needed to quickly make a decision. Without the screen, I would have waited much longer to hear the details spoken and answer the questions about the potentially fraudulent charges. It took less than 2 minutes to complete. Third, there’s something about someone explaining a new situation to you that accelerates comprehension. If I had received an email from American Express pointing me to the same webpage with the information about the payments, I could have managed just fine. But there was someone explaining, taking the time to ensure I understood, while moving things along. I felt very well taken care of - cossetted and gratified - which is the hallmark of great service. Even if that customer service rep was a robot. For outbound support calls like fraud verification, this system works brilliantly. The domain of my answers is narrow. I’m not going to stump the machine with a random question. Also, the computer drives the agenda and there’s a goal of the call that the system is cajoling me to complete, which is known a priori . Inbound support calls are a much harder technical problem because a computer most likely will know much less about the reason for my call. I could imagine a similar system working for inbound calls if there were a way to transmit my context (which page I’m looking at, what problem I’m facing) and then having a robot walk me through the steps to fix it.  That’s an interesting, unsolved user experience and engineering problem, and a big opportunity. This type of multi-channel customer support call, with data flowing both through audio and IP, both through the telephone and across a screen, is the future of customer support. More data establishes a shared context rapidly a quicker answer and more satisfied customers.

Public companies are often required to disclose the process of their acquisition. LinkedIn’s sale to Microsoft is described step by step in an SEC disclosure and it offers both a peek into how these massive acquisitions are consummated, and also illustrates the best practices for how to run a process, both acquisitions and fundraisings. The timeline above shows how the deal progressed. Five potential bidders are included in the chart including Party C, whose identity is unknown. Note at the beginning of the chart, the bids for each suitor are illustrated as non-zero to separate the lines and make clear each suitor’s behavior. None of these suitors posted offers until May. First, develop relationships with potential suitors long in advance of any transaction. Those relationships will empower you to call a potential buyer or investor and engage with them without having to develop trust and mutual understanding at the same time as trying to sell the business in part or in whole. Second, when you decide to transact, list the five or six top partners. Approach one or two at the beginning to see if there’s interest. If the interest is substantiated, then engage the remainder. After having spoken to both Microsoft and Salesforce about a merger, Jeff engages three other parties: Google, Party C, and Facebook. When chatting with Satya Nadella, Jeff tells him: “although LinkedIn is not for sale, others have expressed interest in an acquisition.” There will be competition in the process. Third, determine the serious bidders and guide them through the process by assisting diligence and building the perception of increasing competition. By mid-April, Salesforce, Microsoft and Google were all diligencing the merger, meeting with LinkedIn teams and discussing their strategy in the board room. Salesforce took an aggressive stance, bidding first. Salesforce’s market capitalization of about $50B and cash position of about $1B meant that a combination would be closer to a merger of equals than a takeover by Microsoft or Google, both of whom are worth 10x+ Salesforce and whose cash positions could buy LinkedIn outright. Salesforce’s bids would be a combination of cash and stock, and Salesforce would likely have to raise debt to finance the acquisition. Like a contingency on a mortgage, this could have made Salesforce’s offer less attractive in comparison to a cash and stock offer from a competitor, perhaps influencing their bidding strategy. In early May, Google bows out, leaving Microsoft and Salesforce as the two bidders. Fourth, drive the process to its conclusion. Two weeks pass before Microsoft bids, and they bid $160, five dollars lower than Salesforce. Over the next four weeks, both suitors perform more diligence, model the financial implications and build groundswell amidst the executive teams and boards to pursue LinkedIn more aggressively. The resulting one-upmanship between Salesforce and Microsoft results in a 15% better price than the initial  Salesforce bid and a premium to the public market share price of about 45%. This is auction pressure and it’s a classic example of how to run a fundraising or acquisition process.

About $1B has been invested in early stage SaaS startups as of November 1. Over the last nine months, marketing startups have raised more dollars in aggregate than any other segment. The chart above shows the early-stage investment dollars by buyer within the organization. Operations teams following second, with human resources focused startups in third. Notably, sales startups raised the least amount of capital. If we compare these trends to the total aggregate market capitalization of public SaaS companies by buyer,  we observe a few interesting patterns. First, the emergence of an operations category. Operations focused startups tend to be vertical, they tend to focus on the specific task of a target customer. This could be helping farmers improve their yields or scientists perform experiments. This operations category hints at the rising importance in the fundraising market of vertical SaaS companies. In addition,  startups focusing on selling to sales teams may be struggling amidst a very competitive and potentially saturated market. Marketing startups, on the other hand, seem to be thriving. An equally competitive category to sales, marketing has seen some consolidation this year with the acquisitions of Marketo and Constant Contact, among others. In addition, there were quite a few analytics companies raising capital this year. Series A round sizes certainly had quite a bit of variance. The median so far as $8.1M, with 25th percentile at $7M and 75th percentile just over $10M. Series B medians were $19.0M with 25th percentile; 75th percentile at $22M. Series A investments totaled $207 million for the first nine months while series B investments touched $720 million. Category Series Median Mean Total Horizontal A 7.3 8.8 149 Vertical A 9.1 9.8 59 Horizontal B 21.0 21.2 423 Vertical B 18.0 19.8 297 Let’s take a quick look at the breakdown between horizontal and vertical SaaS companies. In the Series A market, horizontal startups raised $149M compared to vertical startups at $59M. The median round size for vertical startups is $9.1M compared to $7.3M of horizontal startups. But that difference is not statistically significant. In the series B Market, the funding share was closer to even with $423M invested in horizontal companies and $297M in vertical ones. In this market, horizontal startups averaged a greater round size, but again the difference is not meaningful. It clear that the early-stage SaaS fundraising market is healthy despite all the vacillations in the public market. The exuberant acquisition environment should enable some early-stage companies to menace their incumbents and take share, as those behemoths are distracted by M&A. The increasing focus on vertical software startups shouldn’t be surprising. Many of the most of apparent and immediate opportunities in the software market have been filled by now SaaS incumbents. The systems of record for sales, customer support, marketing, human resources have turned over once already since the client/server days and in some categories twice. Meaningful innovation will be required to shift customers once more. In contrast, SaaS has not yet come to many vertical categories and in some places DOS systems still pervade. These customers are hungry for novel software with similar user experiences to what they’ve become accustomed to on the web and their mobile phone. And investors are excited to support them. Artificial intelligence is to be a big trend in the SaaS world, a theme that matured in 2016 but will very much continue through 2017.  17% of SaaS companies who have raised so far in 2016 employ machine learning. Potentially, these new sets of technologies that have advanced speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and anomaly detection will be enough to subvert the incumbent systems of record.

Numbers provide us a certain certainty. With their precision, they offer a sense of black and white, in or out. But, metrics alone aren’t enough. All the quantitative analysis in the world won’t lead me to the next great idea for startup. Those figures can’t create empathy, develop the right culture, or hire the right people. I’ve been thinking about this quite a bit because in both the recent Software Engineering Daily podcast I did with Jeff, and the presentation I gave at Launch Conference, the question of the limits of metrics surfaced. In those conversations, we discussed two shortcomings of data. On Software Engineering Daily, Jeff asked whether metrics can lead us into a local maximum or minimum. And the answer is yes. Data is not a way to create new ideas. Pixar never ran linear regressions to create Woody the Cowboy. Rather, data is a way to optimize a funnel, whittle down a series of options, evaluate experiments. It is a filtering tool, not an ideation tool. Startup idea generation has always been closer to poetry (with a healthy addition of user research) than accounting. At the Launch Conference, an audience member asked whether a single metric, even a proxy metric, is enough to determine the viability of an idea. The answer is no. Most metrics we evaluate are rear-view mirror metrics. And each metric only describes a facet of the business. To describe a publicly traded company, you might use five or six: market cap, revenue multiple, gross margin, cash flow, revenue growth rate, profitability. Even then, those figures provide only the foggiest outline of a company. Like historians, investors use numbers to compare and contrast, to categorize and critique. We identify unusual companies, those with best in class sales efficiency or revenue growth. Management teams employ metrics to identify when a particular part of a company is performing in an unexpected way. Sagging quota attainment suggests sales recruiting and t practices are worth investigating. Often, data is a filter. We have shown in analysis on this blog how revenue growth is not correlated with series A pre-money valuation. And, at least one third of premium SaaS companies raise capital before generating a dollar of revenue. That means that the early stages, while we can look at metrics to evaluate companies, these numbers don’t tell the majority of the story. It might be the case that as a company grows and matures and mechanizes its business model and its go to market strategy, that numbers capture more and more of the business. But even then, data is just one way to describe a business. I hope the metrics I publish inspire. They show what can be done, but not how to do it. They show that there are many different ways of building a company, whether it is the astronomical growth rate of Slack and Salesforce or the brick by brick execution of Atlassian or Concur. But they will never capture the entirety of the story. And for every one path trod by a business, there is another path less taken that a founding team will take to redefine all the rules and observations. We can measure elephant’s height, the length of its tusks, its weight, how fast it runs, even sequence its genome. But like the six blind men who disagree on which animal stands before them , no one perspective, even a data driven one, is not sufficient to fully describe it.

At my first programming job, I met a colleague who took all his notes in XML. He liked the fact he could structure them well, create programs to search and process them, and display them in many different ways. Most importantly, he future-proofed his notes. Because they were structured, he could transform his notes into any new format. That was my first exposure into the world of productivity hacking. After seeing him work, I read Getting Things Done and I subscribed to Merlin Mann’s 43Folders , a website dedicated to productivity hacking. I was baptized into the faith of Inbox Zero . Mann outlined the telos of his creation: It’s about how to reclaim your email, your atten­tion, and your life. That “zero?” It’s not how many mes­sages are in your inbox–it’s how much of your own brain is in that inbox. Especially when you don’t want it to be. That’s it. I’ve been operating with the goal of Inbox Zero for many years. Like a dieter trying to lose weight, I’ve wavered from the paleo version (only focus on internal emails) to the SouthBeach (delete everything that’s more than 3 days old). And I’ve certainly regressed at times, letting that inbox count balloon. Inbox Zero is always in the back of my mind, every time I tap the Gmail icon. To attain Inbox Zero, I forward emails that I can’t answer immediately to a task list. It’s really easy now with the Front/Asana integration. There are two benefits. First, I can batch similar types of emails together - meetings to schedule for example. The second is more control over my time. When I’m in my task lisk, I estimate how long each task will take and prioritize them in a separate context. I’m prioritizing my work, not my inbox. Each evening, I decide the three or four key things to accomplish for the next day. Working that way for several months, I’ve come to the conclusion that Inbox Zero is necessary but insufficient to my productivity. There’s a bigger objective than the cheerful sun Google displays when my inbox is empty. The better goal, the ultimate aim, is Task List zero: getting to the end of the day having completed the three or four most important goals. Part of determining those three or four things is parsing through emails and prioritizing them. The harder part is saying no to others . People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. That’s the challenge about productivity that no framework, no software will ever truly solve. It’s the self-discipline of focusing on the 3 or 4 things that matter today that’s the hard part.

The number of vendors selling to sales and marketing has exploded from 500 to more than 3000 over the last three years. Are we reaching the end of an expansionary cycle? The software pendulum tends to swing between software suites, offering a collection of different tools, and best-of-breed point solutions. But, have we reached the point where the best-of-breed, fragmented ecosystem is a permanent fixture? Okta’s Businesses at Work 2016 report calculates most enterprises pay for somewhere between 10-15 corporate applications. Those are the ones sanctioned by IT. How about the others? Netskope’s Cloud Report calculates the average enterprise uses 613 cloud apps, a figure that doubled over the course of 2015. In addition, more than 20 percent of those surveyed use more than 1000. CEB found more than 30% of IT spend is bottoms up . Can this continue? Consumerization of IT is a powerful secular trend that has shifted the purchasing decision from CIOs to line of business owners, because new solutions, these point solutions offer important differentiation to the line of business owners. As long as this differentiation is substantial, we will continue to see fragmentation. A marketer who uses a best in class marketing automation solution to attain their lead and meeting numbers is not going to give up that piece of software without a fight. But, this expanding constellation of point solutions does present some problems. First, billing. How does an organization understand exactly how much of the spending on software and so much of the purchasing decision is fragmented? Second, integrations across a thousand different pieces of software will be an enormous challenge. APIs certainly solve some of these data movement challenges, but they will not eliminate all friction. Third, how you train a team on so many different pieces of software? How do you ramp up new employees? Fourth, when something goes wrong who do you call? You have a thousand phone numbers to choose from. The advantages of point solutions have to outweigh those costs. Over the last 10 years, the first decade of SaaS, startups have brought distribution, design, technology advantages and even have created new categories. Those startups who have sustainable competitive advantage will continue to thrive. But, we are starting to see some categories with large numbers of entrant, where suddenly price is the diffentiator, because the category has been established and there very few barriers to entry. The recent boom in venture capital investment certainly intensifies competition with lots of new businesses chasing the same dollar. These are the spaces where we will see suites develop, where commodification is inexorable. If you are competing on price, at some point you will bottom, the price you cannot undercut. At that point, the business will begin to compete on service rather than product, customer acquisition, technology, category creation etc. And whoever has the bigger balance sheet balance sheet will win . Businesses can unlock a lot of value in bundling the collection of commodity products. They sell an integrated suite to a customer offering them a single purchasing process, a single customer support experience, and a “seamless” product. Without sufficient product differentiation in the market, this is a powerful way to change the buyer’s key purchasing criteria. This year, we’ve seen more than 30 $1B software acquisitions. We will see more, and bigger companies will begin to bundle software into their offerings creating suites in SaaS. In categories with little technology or other differentiation, that may very well be the winning strategy. Meanwhile, successful startups will continue to do what they always have: develop sustainable competitive advantages through technology, speed of execution, and distribution innovations.

Demand generation is a critical limiting factor to the growth of many startups. I had the opportunity to moderate a panel of demand generation experts recently at Heavybit , an incubator in San Francisco. I asked the panelists, how well understood is demand generation, considering it is one of the core elements of business needs to sustain its growth? Unanimously, the panel concluded it’s not very well understood. At the outset of every startup that attains product market fit, a collection of innovators adopt the product. They educate themselves, power through early challenges and bugs, and commit themselves to the effort because the startup’s vision resonates with them deeply. In some cases, the startup’s market fit is so good they are able to capture substantial share of the early adopter market purely on word-of-mouth, organic growth and customer interest. However, at some point, the marginal quantity of self educators and early adopters fails to sustain rapid growth . Facing a declining growth rate, the startup has to generate demand in a different way than they have in the past. The next big chunk of buyers require a different sales motion than innovators and early adopters. What does that mean exactly?  The chart above is Everett Rogers’s Innovation Diffusion chart , a theoretical segmentation of the buyer market by their proclivity to purchase innovative software. The early and late majority segments comprise 68% of the market, and these buyers don’t buy software the way early adopters buy software. The fattest part of the market often demands more education, more handholding, more social proof through case studies & references, and a relationship with a salesperson or account manager to feel comfortable with the purchase. These buyers might also rely on industry analyst reports like Forrester and Gartner to substantiate a purchasing decision and minimize their career risk. Remember, you’re in the business of selling promotions and many businesses value continuity over innovation. To reach the early/late majority of the software buying market requires different tactics because unlike the early adopters, early/late majority buyers aren’t looking to change. There’s the risk of a failed deployment, the risk of picking a suboptimal vendor, and the risk of budget overruns. Demand generation is about creating urgency in a buyer population that doesn’t currently feel a pressing need to swap their procurement software, their collaboration tools or their business intelligence suite. Why should I consider changing my software? And why should I change it now?  Content marketing over the lifecycle of the buyer, webinars, customer events, conversations with salespeople. Industry analyst reports, case studies with notable customers, keynotes with effusive praise from lighthouse customers, key distribution partners. All of these components educate the buying population and attempt to induce urgency. Reaching the majority requires a diversity of different channels. Social media, industry publications, mass media press, search engines and many others. Building a portfolio of these education channels is critical to scaling demand generation. Aided and unaided recall are metrics that are frequently used in the online advertising world but doesn’t yet have broad usage within SaaS demand generation. These recall figures measure what fraction of the population expresses knowledge about a particular brand with and without prompting. The greater number of impressions, be they organic or sponsored, the greater the unaided recall. That metric is a proxy for awareness in the buyer population. After a startup has measured the awareness of their brand within the population and see that is increasing steadily, they then be confident to focus on engendering urgency. Demand generation is a critical function of growing companies especially as the transition from selling to the innovators and early adopters to the biggest part of the market, the early and late majorities.

Startups fail when they run out of money. Startups run out of money when they lack focus. Without a maniacal focus on serving customer needs in a unique way, startups can flounder amidst competition. Without product market fit,  the business is challenged to generate strong metrics and  faces fundraising challenges. That’s why it’s critical to identify and focus on your startup’s competitive advantage. most of the time, start up competitive advantages fallen to five categories: product, cost, positioning, distribution and execution. Product improvements are common startup differentiators. A better chat experience ; a data modeling layer for data analysis, near-instant transcription of expenses . All of these innovations are product innovations that cause users to switch to a new product. Product advantages can be replicated by competitors given enough time, but they often last several years or more. Cost is another competitive advantage when a new business understands how to minimize their costs relative to competitors.  Amazon Web Services can offer low prices on infrastructure because of their scale, similar to their initial e-commerce business. This pricing advantage is created by economies of scale, and once a leader emerges, it’s very expensive to for others to catch up. Price advantages are more common when hardware or manufacturing are involved, because these types of expenses can be reduced at scale. Most software businesses costs are dominated by salary and very few businesses can outcompete their challengers by paying their employees substantially less. Positioning is a more amorphous competitive advantage but can be just as powerful as the rest. A premium brand versus a value brand: which is your startup? Responsys positioned itself as a premium email marketing company with an ACV of $250k+. In contrast, Marketo’s ACV was roughly $26k and ConstantContact $265 (dollars). Each of these businesses ultimately exited for more than $1B. Another component of brand is category creation. By developing a brand that resonates with customers, that creates a category, and that sufficiently differentiates a business from its competitors, a startup can create a lasting competitive advantage. Gainsight is synonymous with customer success and Intercom for customer communication. Distribution advantages don’t come around very often.  It could be the dawn of  search engine marketing, mobile app store distribution, enterprise apps or distribution, relationships with a key distribution channel, or novel marketing tactic. Dropbox refer-a-friend. Zendesk’s community and referral marketing effort. Bill.com relationship with a national bank. Xero courting accountants to acquire businesses.  Distribution advantages place a startup’s product in front of customers in a scalable, cost-effective way that is difficult to replicate. Execution is a competitive advantage when the team is uniquely qualified to pursue and opportunity. David Duffield founded and ran PeopleSoft before starting Workday, a SaaS disruptor to an incumbent whose business he understood better than anybody else. Because after all he had built it. To be successful, a startup needs only one or two of these competitive differentiators to succeed. Trying to do all five increases the complexity and execution of the business. Consistently, the startups that differentiate based upon the founders’ strengths (product, marketing, partnerships, expertise)are the ones with stronger competitive advantages. Pick one or two for your business and focus on those.

What is the optimal contract length with for your SaaS startup? Monthly, annual, multiyear? It’s common to see SaaS startups initially price their products on a monthly basis, then add an enterprise “Call Me” plan which hides behind it an annual contract. As the business increases its price point, it may eventually book contracts spanning two, three or even five years. This pricing pattern has a certain rationale to it. It enables an early-stage software company to rapidly gather feedback. At the outset, when the business prices on a monthly basis, the startup is looking for as much information about the strength of their product market fit as possible. Monthly payment plans minimize the friction associated with new users signing up and using the product, while still testing their willingness to pay. More users means more data means better test results on marketing, conversion funnels, and engagement. A monthly payment plan reduces the initial outlay a new user has to consider when trialing a product. In addition, the user knows they can turn at any time. If the monthly churn figures are low, the startup gains confidence in the product market fit. Even though the users have the opportunity to cancel anytime, they continue to use the product. After the initial testing phase with monthly pricing plans is complete, a startup will likely hire an inside sales team and compensate them based on quota. This is a natural transition point to adopt annual contracts, because quota calculation requires it. When precisely to hire an inside sales team varies widely by company. Atlassian never did it. Salesforce hired teams early on, but moved to annual contracts after achieving more than $10M in ARR, and other companies start with annual contracts almost immediately. Annual contracts bring predictability to a SaaS startup. Revenues committed for 12 months, and the cash flow characteristics of annual prepay contracts are an enormous boon for the business, reducing the total amount of financing the might have to raise. In addition, annual contracts enable customer success teams to develop longer-term relationships with customers, create account plans and help their customers achieve long-term goals, rather than react to immediate fires in order to “save” revenue. Multiyear contracts are more typical as price points approach $250k or $500k per year and as the startup matures. The buyer perceives far less risk in committing long-term to a vendor because that vendor’s stature as a market leader is supported by its brand, capitalization, references from customers and many other factors. Matching your SaaS startup’s contract duration to the product development phase is a powerful tool for maximizing experimental data during the early days. Shifting to annual and longer term contracts after experimentation phase insurers/startups can benefit from stronger cash collections and structure sales goals effectively.

Why is this ad appearing on this site? This was a frequent questions both advertisers and publishers asked of Google. Behind the scenes, machine learning models match the best ad to the best website, given a set of constraints including budget and the dynamics of the ad auction. To untangle the decision chain across the many different targeting systems to answer the question is a knotty task indeed. In March, the head of Google research Peter Norvig spoke at MIT . One of the challenges facing computer scientists over the next decade, he said, is debugging the complex machine learning systems that power revolutionary products from photo recognition to speech recognition to machine translation. Microsoft announced yesterday they built a speech engine that understands spoken English as well as humans . Google Photos identifies photos of people throughout their growth from infant to toddler to teen. These benefits are just the beginning of the advances we’ll see from new forms of machine intelligence. But they face the same challenge as the Google advertiser asking why did the ad appear here? How can we explain how hyper-complex systems work? The problem isn’t limited to a few marketers. Regulators in the European Union are writing legislation that grants citizens a right to explanation. In a world where machine learning ranks certain recruiting candidates above others, evaluates college student applications, characterizes work output, we will all want to understand why. Today, we ask these questions of email. Why wasn’t this one tagged as spam? Or Netflix and Amazon recommendations. No, I do not want to read a bodice-ripper. But in the future, as computer systems assist humans in broader and more critical decisions, the questions will persists and multiply in both complexity and importance. Why wasn’t I accepted to my first choice college? What about my code did the algorithm deem to be low-quality? I’m ranked lower than my peers at work: why? A large high-frequency trader sold a huge quantity of out-of-the-money puts on Apple and the stock market fell 10 percent in a day. Why? I don’t believe that these novel machine intelligence systems will supplant and replace consequential decisions in the interim for many applications. They will support and inform human-decision making, which reinforces the need for many of these systems to explain why. Sakichi Toyoda pioneered the use of the Five Whys , a diagnostic tool to diagnose, understand and improve Toyota’s production system. Jeff Bezos used the Five Whys in 2004 to investigate why a conveyor belt  had injured a worker. This technique helps us establish cause and effect. Today, we can’t ask the Five Whys of most of the intelligent computer systems. Establishing cause and effect in complex multi-layer neural networks is a challenging problem to solve, and it will be a critical one if machine learning is to fulfill its promise.

2016 has been a volatile year. Major capital investments fell 55% in Q3. The IPO market is a tale of two cities with some companies able to go public and catapult their valuations, but the overall number remains in the single digits.  Last, M&A activity seems quite brisk with more than 30 $1B+ billion acquisitions in the last nine months alone. How do all these factors commingle to influence today’s acquisition environment? And how does it compare historically? Year to date, $54B worth of software companies have been acquired.  2016 is on pace to match the past three years of software acquisition trends which vary from $64B-$70B.  However, in 2016 the total number of acquisitions will likely fall by 40% from an average of 150 per year to 92. Fewer acquisitions at higher prices. Over the course of those six years, the median acquisition price of a software company has varied between $40M and $80M and in 2016 has settled to about $60M. On the other hand, the average software acquisition is hurtling toward $1 billion in value after having plateaued around $250M earlier in the decade. That’s because the very largest acquisitions continue to increase in size. Whereas earlier in the decade, the largest software acquisitions varied from $4 to $8B, in the last four years, the smallest maximum acquisition is $8B and the largest is $29B. Interestingly, the total value of acquisitions hasn’t increased dramatically as one might have expected given the 57% reduction in multiples of SaaS companies in particular. Over the last few months we seen a reversion to the mean of about 5x forward revenues compared to recent highs of 7.7x (in early 2014) and lows of 3.2. In summary, the very largest acquisitions continue to grow larger,. Every company is becoming a software company and the transformational change that as a Service software delivery challenges incumbents to pivot their  businesses to new models, often in the form of very large acquisitions.

Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away. Antoine de St. Exupery I remember launching a new filtering feature a Google within the AdSense product. At the time, we had hundreds of thousands of website publishers using our user-interface to accomplish many tasks. They might download reports of their revenue from running AdSense ads, configure ads to match their website’s style, and indicate their preferences for the content of the ads to be shown on their site. Unfortunately, the feature we launched interested less than 2% of the current user base. A few weeks after the launch, I wondered to myself whether we should pull the feature. On one hand, a few hundred users benefited from our hard work. On the other hand, we had introduced new complexity for the other hundreds of thousands of users. In addition, we had broadened the product and engineering surface area for testing and subsequent product design. In some way, we were introducing product debt. Product debt is different than technical debt, a word that elicits shudders from engineers. Technical debt means having to go back and rewrite significant amounts of code because they weren’t built to scale or were written in an esoteric language. Creating is much more fun than rewriting or refactoring. Product debt encompasses the collections of features that work well, but are used by tiny fractions of the user population. They introduce all kinds of complexity downstream. You can imagine when an publisher wants to filter advertisements that can destroy many different ways: they can filter by language, geography, keywords, demographics, platform. Each of those filters has to be considered in combination with the others,  creating an explosive combinatorial effect. A new filtering type that benefits only a small fraction of the population must be considered for every subsequent change in other filters or each incremental filter. Designers have to invent new ways to communicate the complexity. Quality assurance teams must design rubrics to test everything is working properly. And product managers designing new features have more intricacies. Last and most importantly, users have to use the product with increasing complications. In retail, there’s a concept called carrying cost , which includes all the costs to store inventory. It includes costs like the warehouse, the staff, the shipping, and depreciation of the merchandise. Carrying costs underscore the idea that more product isn’t always better,  because there are costs associated with more. And startups, there is an analogous idea of a product carrying cost. Each product and engineering organization must decide what product carrying costs they are willing to bear explicitly. What fraction of users must use a feature for it to remain? Or what fraction of revenue-generating users or total revenue? Removing the features that don’t meet that criteria ensure product development organizations can move more quickly, reduce their product debt, and deliver to their users a more perfect experience, in which nothing else can be taken away.

What are the attributes of the ideal SMB SaaS company, an entrepreneur asked me recently.  It’s a good question.  There are product, marketing, and sales attributes to that ideal company that successful SaaS business have exemplified in the past. Product A beautifully designed, simple and elegant product is the first and most important thing. The product satisfies the top three priority for the software buyer and consequently the software buyer uses a software very frequently.  I believe that the next wave of SaaS companies will be centered around workflows, Event Driven SaaS , and this extends to SMB SaaS. For example, NetSuite is the application many small to medium businesses used to manage their financials. The finance teams of these businesses live within the product, and it has become the system of record for some of the most critical information within the business. The product has network effects and data network effects. In short as more people use the product and as more information is stored in the database, the more valuable it becomes. Slack is a classic example here. The more people use Slack, the more valuable it becomes, the more information is stored within it, the more people want to search the history, the more people pay. Human network effect plus data network effect reinforcing each other. Acquisition The product enables self-education of a user. In other words, a user can sign up, immediately understand the value proposition of the product and decide whether or not to use it. This is a combination of a product attribute and an acquisition attribute. Slack is a terrific example. The product also grows through word-of-mouth as new users fall in love with it and become evangelists, spreading the word within their teams and companies and beyond. Zendesk grew in large part by building relationships with these evangelists. The company is able to acquire customers through many different channels including organic, channel partners, and a viable online paid acquisition strategy. Xero, the New Zealand based accounting company, has leveraged the accountant channel to dominate New Zealand and Australia, and expand into the UK and the United States. By educating accountants who then in turn educate their clients, Xero has built an enormous business. Sales & Marketing Ideally, the company creates a new category, the way that Hubspot defined inbound marketing. Building a brand that is synonymous with a category is a huge strategic advantage. Last, the business and product are able to move upmarket as the market demands it of them. This means that the product can serve midmarket customers and the economics can justify an inside sales team. New Relic’s evolution from smaller accounts into larger enterprise business is a great example. I don’t have the answer to building an amazing SMB SaaS company. I’ve written a list of the attributes of some of the most successful companies. Just because a new SaaS startup might embody many of the attributes the list I’ve written above doesn’t mean they will be successful. The business could be a Ford Edsel , even with all the market research and theoretical advantages in hand. But as the illustrious list of successes above demonstrates these attributes do correlate with great success.

Recently, we examined the comparative efficiency of bottoms-up and top-down businesses. Today, we’ll dig into valuation metrics to see if there’s any systematic bias in the investor community for SMB, Mid-Market and Enterprise SaaS companies. Using public data, I categorized the 50 or so public companies by ACV at IPO. SMB is less than $10k, Mid-Market is between $10k and $100k, and Enterprise is greater than $100k in average customer value. The data indicates that SMB companies trade on average at 8.1x trailing revenues, Mid-Market at 5.9x, and Enterprise companies at 6.5x. The difference between the Mid-Market and SMB figures are statistically significant at an R^2 of 0.09, but none of the other figures are statistically different. The Enterprise data set includes 9 companies so the sample size isn’t large enough there to overcome an interesting dynamic of the enterprise market: the bi-modal distribution. There are three Enterprise businesses trading at premium multiples of around 10x trailing, but also 3 that trade at below 3x trailing. In the SMB and Mid-Market, there’s quite a bit of variance. The SMB market multiples more consistently higher than Mid-Market, echoing the first chart. So, are Mid-Market companies consistently considered less valuable businesses? No. The biggest SaaS companies are Mid-Market companies. The chart above shows the distribution of the sample by revenue, and I’m excluding two of the largest SaaS companies as outliers because they skew the chart. These enormous businesses can’t sustain the same growth rates as their smaller revenue peers in both SMB and Enterprise, and so they receive a slightly smaller multiple. Overall, there is no meaningful difference in valuation by customer size. A SaaS startup at scale is going to be valued by its growth, market size, and long term prospects, irrespective of how many customers of what size it acquires.

How fast could a SaaS business grow on paid acquisition? If the business decided today to sprint and acquire as many customers as possible? We can model it with some assumptions, some of which are quite aggressive. Let’s take a startup with $1.2M on the balance dedicated to customer acquisition. Assume a $10,000 CAC, an 80% gross margin and a payback period of 12 months. We’ll assume customers begin to pay the month after they sign up, and all this math implies customers pay a monthly fee of $1042 ($12,500 ACV over 12 months). Assume zero net churn and no impact of the crush of new customers on sales or support. To maximize revenue, the startup should spend all of its customer acquisition dollars in the first month. We’ll also assume all sales cycles close within the month. Here’s a basic financial model that compares the growth rate of two scenarios: spend all the money in month 1 vs spend the money ratably, $100k per month, over the 12. And here’s a quick summary. Scenario Exit ARR, $M 12 Month Revenue Total, $M TSM Growth Rate Up Front 4.0 2.3 10.3% Ratable 2.7 1.2 18.9% The Up Front spending plan generates 33% more revenue and exits the year at more than 92% larger ARR. But the business is growing at a slower rate. But because of the sudden influx of customers in month 1, the growth rate is less. Law of large numbers working against the plan. We can write an equation to quickly calculate the revenue of the Up Front spending tactics: IC stands for initial contribution of marketing spend ($1.2M in our example above). MRR is the monthly fee of each customer. CAC is the total CAC and n is the number of periods you want to calculate, in our case, 12. This example is purely theoretical and they ignore many key practical realities of slower customer sales cycles, hiring people, customer churn, delayed payment cycles, customer support burden, constant CAC and many other factors. This is the Usain Bolt way to grow a SaaS startup: all out, all the time, and loads of confidence you’ll do it right the first time. Most startups pursue a metered marketing approach rather than an all out approach to distribute their risk. If the initial marketing message isn’t perfect, you’ve wasted all your marketing spend on month 1 and have no recourse. The models do show that the metered strategy can be a very successful strategy, yielding terrific growth at 19% monthly at the end of 12 months. The key difference between the two strategies is that ARR is about $1.2M less each month, a gap that remains roughly constant over this twelve month period. In exchange for smaller ARR and revenue, the more conservative plan provides the startup an ability to ramp employees, hedge marketing strategies over time, and much more optionality.

ARR 1 5 10 25 50 100 New Customers per Year 1333 6667 13,333 33,333 66,667 133,333 When an SMB SaaS startup is young with quickly growing revenues, more of the same works. A $1M ARR SaaS startup with an average selling price of $750 per year needs to add 1,333 each year on average to double. Fast-forward two years when the company is at $5M in ARR and the business needs to be adding 13,333 customers each year. At $25M in ARR, suddenly the 100% growth figure demands 33,333 customers. All this math assumes that the selling price remains the same. For some SMB SaaS companies, generating this kind of lead volume even at scale isn’t a challenge. There are many notable companies whose average selling price at IPO is less than $5000. Xero, Wix, Zendesk are among them. But many SMB SaaS startups eventually outstrip their initial user acquisition channels whether they be word-of-mouth, content marketing, mobile app distribution, channel partnerships. The customer acquisition techniques either become too expensive, or are simply unable to produce enough leads to continue to grow at aggressive rates. At this point, these SMB SaaS startups face the choice of staying the course and continuing to pursue the SMB market by developing new channels and broadening the product suite like Atlassian; or move upmarket, increase prices and reduce the total number of new customers required to double revenue. The arguments for moving upmarket, seeking customers who will pay $20,000-$50,000 per year include achieving some economies of scale : fewer account executives and sales development representatives to drive more revenue; fewer customers success executives to manage an equal amount of ARR; marketing focus on a segment of the total prospect population. Counterpoints for moving upmarket also exist. Namely, the business must evolve from its origins and its original customer base to serve a larger customer base with different product requirements, different expectations on sales motions, and tiering of customer support. There’s also a cultural shift that many companies undergo during this time from being a business that is product led to a business that is more sales driven. The further upmarket a SaaS company goes, the more individual customer demands influence product roadmap. Some go-to-market teams are able to balance these demands well using Kenny van Zant’s flywheel model . There is no universal answer to which direction to pursue: remain in the SMB segment and cross-sell or move up-market, or both. Successful companies have taken both paths. Figuring out the better choice is a key strategic decision for a SaaS startup’s management team. Modeling the implications of each strategy is the first step. What assumptions have to be true in each case for the business to double? And how reasonable are those assumptions? Then it’s on to experimentation.

Like many others, English is my second language. As I learned over time, there’s a particular way of ordering adjectives in English to make yourself understood. Opinion. Size. Shape. Condition. Age. Color. Pattern. Origin. Material. Purpose. Noun. That’s the order most of the time. When I say a unique large curvaceous second-hand modern orange checked Italian carbon fiber racing car, it rolls right off the tongue and you imagine a sleek, if garish, Lamborghini. But if I alter the order just a bit to say carbon fiber checked Italian orange racing second-hand curvaceous unique modern car, I’ve lost you in adjectival gobbledygook. I endured sentence diagrams from a punctilious grammarian for 4 years in an American middle school but we never learnt these guidelines. So when I came across a table like the one I’ve reproduced above, it was a revelation. From the chaos of a language with an exception to every rule, here was a system. English is an eclectic patois. 29% of English words are originally Latin; 29% French; 26% Germanic. But that’s just the head of the distribution. Sky is Old Norse. Coffee is Arabic. So is lemon. Potato is Quechua . Startup cultures are like the English language. A startup’s culture is a mixture of the different people within the company, especially when it’s quite small. As the company grows, the culture alloys and hardens. As startups grow, new employees don’t benefit from the historical context around the culture - how it evolved, who values what, which topics are sensitive. And so they can often start ordering adjectives improperly. Documents like Netflix’s Culture or Valve’s Employee Handbook illuminate to prospects and employees what matters to a company, whether they would fit and how to speak the language effectively. Moreover, the process of creating a document like these, even if much narrower in scope, helps teams identify their values and priorities. That knowledge is an essential component of hiring new team members effectively . Identifying, debating and codifying these values and ideas early in a company is an important step, especially when growing quickly. Because before you know it, a startup’s management team must begin to manage by culture .

If I made a word cloud of the terms in 2016 that dominated Startupland, burn would be among them and perhaps the largest. On the contrary, burn would be absent from the 2015 list, replaced by unicorn. Starting in the end of 2015, Public companies have markedly shifted the way they manage their businesses pushing toward cash flow positive and net income positive. In parallel, startup founders and CEOs have markedly shifted the way they communicate and manage their businesses. But the business of managing startups is different than that of public companies. Many investors expect startups to attain far faster growth rates than the 25-75% annual that characterize the public companies with revenues that exceed $100M per year. At the early stages, the fastest growing SaaS companies grow 3-4x annually, then 2-3x annually and eventually asymptote to the aforementioned public figures. If the growth expectations differ from public companies, so must the burn assumptions for early and mid-stage start ups. These business’s goals shouldn’t necessarily to become profitable as fast as possible, but to grow as fast as possible while burning a “reasonable” amount of capital. I’m sure I’ll elicit a bunch of chuckles about that word, reasonable. What is a reasonable? There is no universal answer. But there is one framework for thinking about the right burn rate that I’ve observed recently that several founders have derived: Base Burn & Growth Burn. Base Burn is the amount of money the company spends to operate: real estate, salaries, benefits, legal fees - all of the operating costs of the business. Growth Burn includes the marketing and sales costs of new customer acquisition. Founders managing their business this way aim to drive the business to profitability on Base Burn. Facing a cash shortage, the startup could cut all new customer acquisition to generate profit. With enough cash on the balance sheet, the business can continue to grow at aggressive rates. That rate is likely limited by the payback period of customer acquisition channels. According to the most recent PacCrest survey, the average payback period is around 11 months, but many fast growing companies sustain 15-20 month payback periods. Thinking about Base Burn and Growth Burn in this way provides the company leverage in fundraising conversations because the business always has the option of becoming profitable quickly. But it also enables the management team to grow revenues aggressively in a logical way.

In Startups are Risk Bundles , Leo Polovets outlines the risks startups face as they grow. In particular, Leo identifies common mistakes when addressing that parcel of peril. Addressing minor risk by spending time and effort on low priority or low impact risk a common failure mode for companies. The business isn’t focused on the most critical issues. One founder I met recently took this idea to heart. On the last slide of his presentation, he listed the four key existence risks facing the business today. In the adjacent column, he wrote the strategies he intends to employ to mitigate those risks. Hiring risk: Building the team in a mercenary job market. Product market scale risk: Does the current product address the needs of the broader market and not just customers? Customer success risk: Will the initial customers renew and expand? Fundraising risk: is the company on track to attain the milestones for series A investment? Those are just some of the critical risks facing an early stage software company. This list is my creation, not from the founder’s deck. Another tactic would be to list the key risk for each department for the next quarter or so. This is useful particularly as the business scales and its complexity blooms. Writing this list has a few benefits. As Dr. Art Markman, a PhD in Psychology, articulates , lists like these help teams prioritize and convert intangible goals into concrete work. In addition, they delineate the key priorities of the company explicitly. With the startup risk bundle written down, management teams can focus strategic conversations begin on whether the listed risks are the correct ones and whether the mitigating efforts will be fruitful. In this way, the team can be maximally effective.

Creating and optimizing a sales plan for an early stage SaaS company is a challenging task. There are lots of different variables to manage and the truth is it’s always a work in progress even for massively successful businesses. But at the very earliest days, where do you start? Quota is a function of number of deals closed, sales cycle, price point and conversion rate. When a SaaS company is just releasing its products, none of these are known figures. What is the sales cycle for product that is not yet in market? What is reasonable conversion rate from lead to meeting, and meeting to close? How many prospects can we sell in a month? In the recent SaaStr podcast , former Senior VP of Sales at Marketo Bill Binch recommends narrowing the question by isolating one variable: number of deals reps can close per month. Instead of placing the first few account executives in a SaaS company on a dollar-based quota, use a logo-based quota. Three deals per month or four logos per month for example. Bill recommends this for a few reasons. First, quick wins instill confidence in the sales team which is a key component to building a sense of momentum within the organization. Second, sales reps are freer to experiment with different sales techniques in this model. They can vary the price and they can experiment with different pitches and sales motions. After all, in this phase, salespeople are discovering what techniques and tactics work to help the company scale. It’s the phase of discovering the processes the company will mechanize over the next few years. Third, account executive benefit from additional flexibility during a time when product and positioning will likely change substantially from month-to-month. In the earliest phases of the software company, product roadmap can be quite volatile and the marketing message of the business is in constant flux. After employing the logo based quota for six or so months, sales teams should be able to estimate with a greater degree of accuracy the number of accounts a sales rep can close within a month. This initial experimentation helps solidify one of the key assumptions of a dollar-based quota. At that point, the company could move to a dollar-based quota and the sales reps, now standing on a strong foundation, are set up for success. This isn’t the first time I’ve come across the idea of a logo based quota. One business leader has managed his sales team with a logo based quota for several years with incredible success. His sales team books several million dollars per year per account executive. They sell in the mid-market. When I asked him why logo-based quotas works well for his organization, he replied that the young sales reps he employs don’t have a mental model for what a difficult quota might be. And they have fun challenging each other to see how many deals per month they can close. It may not be right for everybody and it may not be right at every stage, but the idea of a logo based quota can be a powerful arrow in the quiver of early-stage founders, particularly during the initial go to market phase of the business.

If your SaaS startup were to trade in the public markets today, what would it be worth? The true answer is we don’t know, but we can approximate it by comparing it to the other publicly traded SaaS companies and benchmarking the business by its growth rate. The chart above shows the median multiple of public SaaS companies by growth rate bucket, 25%-49%, 50%-74%, and 75%+ trailing twelve month revenue growth rate. Each color represents a different year. Let’s take the big green bar in the 75% bucket. In 2013,  the median SaaS company growing at 75%+ traded at a multiple of 14.2x. That’s very likely an all time record. The red bar indicates 2016 figures. Today, 75%+ growers trade at 7.4x. A company growing between 50-74% trades at 5.1x and 25%-49% at 4.7x today. These slower growing companies are fetching near historically high multiples, which suggest they aren’t being valued on growth alone, but likely net income profitability and cash flow. Again, this is an approximation. If we break out the data into individual data points, the change in the valuation enviroment becomes more apparent. In 2011, only a few companies traded at greater than 10x, even though one business was growing at more than 150% annually. 2012 was more of the same. 2013 on the other hand saw some astronomical multiples. 35x, 28x, 19x, 18x. 2014 recorded a 45x multiple. And since then, valuations have contracted with every single public business trading under 10x. These trends illustrate why 2016 is such a big year for enterprise M&A with about 30 $1B acquistions and take privates to date. In short, every company is trading at a discount relative to two or three years ago. To use a hyperbolic Warren Buffet aphorism, “Buy when there’s blood in the streets”. Though the fundamentals of business may not change substantially, the market’s perception of their value does change. This analysis provides a very basic proxy for estimating a SaaS company’s value. For startups, these values are likely lower than should be able to fetch in the private fundraising market for three reasons. First, capital supply in the venture fundraising market is at near-all time highs, which should increase startup prices. Second, startups tend to grow at rates much faster than these, so investors are willing to pay higher premiums. Third, many SaaS startups are valued on forward revenue as opposed to trailing revenue.

Jeff Wiss has managed demand generation and corporate marketing for some iconic software companies. MySQL, the most valuable open-source acquisition; Zendesk*, the $3B leader in customer support software; DataStax, The business commercializing Cassandra; and most recently Duo Security*, an Ann Arbor-based trusted access company that has some of the most sensational SaaS metrics I’ve ever seen. Recently, I had a chance to talk to Jeff and learn about the unique strategies they employ to drive one of the fastest growing and most efficient SaaS companies in the market today. These are three of the insights he shared with me about Duo’s marketing and customer acquisition strategies. We focus on creative differentiation to complement our product differentiation. We have very different positioning than the rest of the market: we focus on calmness and tranquility, rather than bright red, fear introducing urgency. Selling the problem can be an effective strategy and customer education is critical. But in the security industry, every CISO (chief information security officer) knows the challenge of preventing breaches. Selling the problem is redundant. As Jeff puts it, “Security is failing the industry because there are more and more products, but an increasing number of breaches. It’s easy to dislike security companies.”  Instead, Duo conveys the serenity their product brings to customers. They sell the result of implementing solution, not the problem.  Matching the marketing strategy to the state of the industry is an essential skill of great marketers. Our booth says nothing about the product offering at events. Instead, it says “The most loved company in security.”  Written around that statement are quotes from customers. We find that it’s a great conversation starter. We also talk about having the fastest demo in security.  We can demo our Push authentication technology in less than 15 seconds. That blows people away.  It makes people want to see more and go deeper into the product. Duo’s events strategy reflects the same ideal. Complemented with a lightning quick demo, this one-two punch starts the dialog with prospective customers on an incredibly positive and differentiated footing. At Duo, we align the creative strategies with MQL generation. We are very strict about measuring everything we can. We tie pipeline generation to particular content pieces so we can let the creative team know how their work is driving the business. Jeff started his career as a database marketer. When he joined Duo, he found an organization that valued equally the quantitative part of marketing with the qualitative part. Many people believe marketing organizations can excel in one discipline or another, but I think this is a false dichotomy. Jeff’s team at Duo is proof. Similar to Slack, Duo has a creative director because the CEO, Dug Song, believes in the power of strong creative. The creative director is flanked with two content marketing people, three website developers, two graphic designers and two dedicated videographers.  In addition, the marketing team comprises two event managers, two demand generation people, and two in marketing operations. This structure bears a resemblance to Bill Macaitis’ The 9 Marketing Disciplines Of Great SaaS Companies . Because everybody is goaled on MQLs, there is a terrific alignment within the marketing organization. Jeff has seen many different software companies,  from classic client/server, to open-source databases to bottoms up SaaS. Today, he’s building another great go-to-market effort at Duo. * Redpoint portfolio company

It’s no secret I believe speech is the next input mechanism. We are in the Voice-to-Text Era . I wrote in late 2014 that speech is the fastest user interface , and the newest speech recognition experiments confirm it. Andrew Ng, a luminary in the world of machine learning, and his teammates at Baidu, Stanford and University of Washington have developed Deep Speech 2 , a neural network based speech recognition system. They tested the speech and accuracy of the system and compared it to people typing on their mobile phones. The results were clear no matter the language. For English, speech recognition was three times faster than typing, and the error rate was 20.4 percent lower. In Mandarin Chinese, speech was 2.8 times faster, with an error rate 63.4 percent lower than typing. Stanford News There are many limitations of speech. It’s not always a convenient input mechanism; speaking to your phone in the middle of a meeting is bound to derail it. And speech also faces the uphill battle of changing societal norms. Saying “send email to Tomer hi comma how is the pilot going question mark” will likely arouse the same feelings of judgemental hostility to geekdom in passersby as the Bluetooth headset five years ago. Regardless of all these frictions, speech is much faster and far more accurate irrespective of language. This speed advantage will render speech to be the primary form of input to computers, initially with mobile phones, but ultimately with laptops. The ramifications are broad. We will redesign offices to contain the persistent murmurs of people speaking to their machines. Natural language understanding, the science of computers deciphering our meaning, will become critically important to master for major Internet and Software companies. Users and buyers of software will change their buying parameters to include speech recognition. Ultimately, we will all be more productive for it. The best tools are the ones we don’t recognize we’re using because they are extensions of our bodies. Learn to use a fork to eat, and quickly, spearing a morsel on tines becomes as natural as raising a peach to your lips. The QWERTY keyboard, a relic of an era when the typewriter needed to slow the typist to prevent hammers from criss-crossing and jamming, will be a curiosity, a relic soon. Speech will replace it, and transform the human-computer interaction in the process.

Success has 1000 fathers and failure is an orphan. I heard this aphorism in my first year as a venture capitalist having forgotten it. There’s a lot of wisdom to it and I think it’s most applicable when interviewing. I remind myself of the same each time I speak with a candidate for a role. When I see a sterling resume, I know that I am susceptible to confirmation bias.  Top-tier university. Highly competitive first job out of school. Early employee at a unicorn company. All those things are fantastic leading indicators that a candidate might be a wonderful hire or a founder of a new company. Many times those leading indicators do indicate a high performance person. But these markings also reinforce confirmation bias and can contribute to overconfidence in a hiring decision. Conversely, a candidate without a pedigree may be ruled out quickly and erroneously as a result of the very same conversation bias. Reed College dropout. Technician at Atari. Seven month sabbatical to India at 19. Farmer at a commune in Oregon. Name that founder. That’s why discipline in the hiring process is so important. Maia Josebachvilli of Greenhouse recommends a deep collaboration between a recruiter and hiring manager. “A well structured kickoff meeting between the recruiter and the hiring manager is a fundamental requisite to success across all these metrics. In that meeting, the hiring manager and recruiter should define two things. First, the 30 day goals of the role, from which a recruiter will distill the key skills required in the job. Second, the long-term objectives of the job, which will reveal the attributes and values of the person.” Professor Adam Grant advocates using structured interviews a technique that increases hiring success predictability by 3x . Laszlo Bock, the former Chief People Officer at Google, outlines some more techniques Google employs in his book, Work Rules!. And of course, references are a critical part of understanding the way former colleagues and co-workers perceived a person. Many times, they are the most valuable component of the interviewing process. These methods aim to reduce and ideally eliminate the unconscious biases we bring into the room when we interview candidates, to determine who really would be the best person to contribute to the success of an organization.

I met an entrepreneur last week with an amazing command of technology history. He spoke about the way the Xerox Alto has influenced graphical design over the past forty years. I learned a lot. For this first computer’s monitor has a portrait orientation, not a landscape orientation? His knowledge of history provides him a huge competitive advantage because he understands why things have evolved a certain way and the assumptions that underpinned previous decisions. I remember when I started at Google, I had lots of ideas about how to improve things, and I made many naive suggestions. I had a vision for how how email should evolve and Marissa Mayer sent me to meet a few people within the company. One engineering leader patiently listened to all the ideas I spewed. When I had finished, he asked me a question. “Why do you think your ideas haven’t been implemented before? Do you think it’s because you’re the first person with the idea or could it be another reason?” And he was right. I thought, vaingloriously, that I had been the first one with the idea. He wasn’t discouraging me from ideating or promoting my ideas. Rather, he was inviting me to understand the history and the context for why things are the way they are today. When we diligenced Looker, I only really understood Lloyd’s ingenuity when we spoke to industry experts who shared the industry’s history. They explained traditional business intelligence systems had been designed when storing one gigabyte cost $10,000 . The system architects of the day designed their systems assuming storage was prohibitively expensive. Today, it costs about a cent. The fundamental cost assumption critical to the system design is no longer valid. Lloyd recognized that this key tenet of BI system design had become outdated and architected a new system that capitalized on this change. That’s the benefit of knowing and understanding history: understanding the assumptions that led to the status quo and being able to seize the opportunity when one of those assumptions no longer holds.

In February, public SaaS companies had fallen 57% from their highs. The enterprise value to forward revenue more than halved from 7.7x to 3.3x. This ostensibly random valuation correction has triggered a flurry of consolidation in software, with nearly $70B+ worth of exits year to date in 2016. Over the last six months, however, forward multiples have reverted to the mean. After touching a low of 3.3x forward in February, forward multiples have appreciated by 6% for each of the last six months. Overall, SaaS companies now trade at 4.7x forward, which is quite nearly the median for the last two years of 5.2x. In other words, we’re back to a “normal” valuation environment. I say “normal” because there is no right way to value SaaS companies; it’s just what the market will bear. The top quartile companies have rebounded the fastest, nearly doubling their forward multiples. That’s not surprising given these companies are growing fastest, have the most attractive margin profiles and none suffered material changes in their business’ over the past six months. All of these vacillations of the public market seem to have impacted valuations in Series D and later rounds, but haven’t pressured early stage valuations downwards. The early stage market, bolstered by near record amounts of venture capital fundraising, remain insulated. Depressed multiples have triggered consolidation and though we’ve seen some appreciation in public SaaS forward multiples over the past six months, I suspect the wave of consolidation continues because prices remain rational, and even below historical norms.

A senior SaaS executive once told me, “Reports sell software.” In a top down sale, that’s absolutely true. The CEO wants better predictability of bookings so she’ll buy a CRM tool to gather the data. Classically, software has been built for that mantra. First, a company buys a database. The sales people, marketers or customer care staff continue working as normal. But after the purchase, these teams are burdened with an additional step of updating the database when they’ve finished their work, so a report can be generated. But this design has an agency problem. The employees investing the marginal effort see very little gain. This agency problem challenges the effectiveness of the software in three ways. First, managers must motivate employees to update the database. Second, since employees report data retroactively, the database is always out of date, undermining the accuracy of the reports. Third, the benefit of the software to employees is only visible months or years after filling up the database, when an employee can review the history of a customer interaction for example. In bottoms up sales, workflow sells software . And new SaaS companies who aim to displace incumbent systems of record will architect their products in a radically different way. They will be event-driven SaaS companies. Event driven SaaS products consume events from data sources, data sources like social media, news, analytics data, marketing data, customer support data, sales data. All of these events are ingested via API and committed to the database. Day one, these new systems of record are filling themselves with data. Using this information, they prioritize and inform work to aid their teams be more effective. That can be by prioritizing which customers to speak with, automatically answering customer support queries or any number of things not yet invented. Critically, there’s a feedback loop. The users’ actions are themselves events that feed back into the database. Separately, the system generates a similar report. Event-driven SaaS products mitigate and ideally eliminate the agency problem of classic software. Users benefit directly from using it. The reporting is a by-product of an optimized workflow, and coincidentally is much more accurate than a classical system. This agency problem the heart of the adoption challenges of classical software deployments, and in particular of the dominant systems of record in the market today. The next generation of multi-billion dollar SaaS platforms, the startups who will displace incumbents, will do it with event-driven architectures and optimized workflows. Thanks to Manny Medina for inspiring this post.

Sales teams are the tip of the spear for SaaS companies. They close accounts and book the revenue. Many sales teams often find themselves confronting the same issues. Mike Anello and Kane Hochster, two HBS students, researched this topic by surveying more than 30 VPs of Sales. The survey included both rising and seasoned leaders across a range of revenue ranges but with a concentration in earlier stage startups. Mike and Kane aimed to find the areas where sales teams underinvest across seven key responsibilities: hiring, onboarding, pricing, process, structure, training & development and upsell. Rising sales leaders reported being the least confident in Development/Training, Upsell and Onboarding across these seven responsibilities. Seasoned sales executives, when asked where early stage companies over and under invest confirmed those areas. The chart above shows the seasoned executives’ opinions on a 9 scale where 4.5 is investing enough. Less than 4.5 means investing too little and above means investing too much. From their point of view, early stage companies spend too much effort optimizing the structure of their teams and not enough of the onboarding, development and hiring of their people. Sales trainers, people hired to train new account executives, are an important part of onboarding and development. About 22% of those surveyed employed full time trainers and most agreed a full time hire makes sense at between 33-40 account executives, which is the roughly the same time sales leaders believe ramp times become predictable. Those teams with sales trainers reported much higher confidence than those with part-time trainers or no trainers. That makes sense since there’s a person in the organization who is evaluated exclusively on training people well.  Interestingly, those without trainers reported the second highest level of confidence, perhaps suggesting some bravado in self-evaluation. The hiring process a critical part of a growing sales team. Mishires often take 3-6 months to discover and are quite expensive . So how can scaling companies improve their hiring process? With data. There was a significant difference between those who measured key attributes of each new hire like coachability work ethic, prior success, and those that didn’t. Data-driven sales people averaged a hiring confidence score of 6.8 vs. 5.1. This survey suggests team development including hiring, onboarding, and training are areas where sales leaders have the least confidence and are likely good areas to explore and invest when scaling a SaaS sales team.  In addition, systematic measurement of sales hires seems to reinforce a leader’s ability in the team. Thanks to Mike Anello, Kane Hochster and Mark Roberge for sharing the data and their analysis with me. Survey data skews to early stage companies: More than 22% of responders were at companies with at less than $5M in ARR and 47% less than $50M in ARR.

They operated from a clandestine apartment in Harlem, a block from Columbia University at 401 West 118th Street. A cell comprising 18 of the most respected American mathematicians and statisticians spirited datasets up the stairs, analyzed them, and stole to Washington DC on military aircraft to present the results of their rumination to the admirals of the Navy and the Marines, the generals of the Army, Marines, and Air Force during the Second World War. Allen Wallis, Director of SRG said of his team, “This was surely the most extraordinary group of statisticians ever organized.” And their impact is hard to overstate. During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, several high-ranking army officers flew to Washington from the battle, spent the day discussing the best settings on proximity fuses for air bursts of artillery shells against ground troops and flew back to the battle so they could put into affected vice from, among others, Milton Friedman whose earlier studies of the fuses had given him extensive and accurate knowledge of the way the fuses actually performed. Milton Friedman’s memoirs, Two Lucky People Many of these men relocated their families abruptly to Manhattan, called to serve their country. Chief among them, Abraham Wald, a Rumanian prodigy whose intellectual parents had home-schooled him. A Jew, Wald respected the sabbath on Saturday and wasn’t permitted attend Rumanian school on Saturdays. His parents homeschooled him instead and Abraham graduated with a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Vienna in 1931. In 1938, he fled Nazism in Austria for New York. He began to teach statistics at Columbia University. Soon thereafter, the SRG recruited Wald to join them.  The US Air Force needed desperately to solve a key problem. Allied planes in the European and Pacific theaters were being shot down at astonishing rate. During the course of the war, more than 43,581 planes would be lost to flak cannons, the Luftwaffe and Japanese Zeros. In a single 376 plane raid in August 1943, 60 B-17s were shot down. The loss rates were so great that it was statistically impossible for a serviceman to survive a 25 mission tour of duty in Europe. With airmen facing impossible odds, the SRG tasked Wald to design and develop a new armor layout for aircraft flying in enemy territory.  The Air Force wanted to reinforce planes, but could only add armor to a small section of the plane. Each pound of armor reduced the bomb payload capacity by one pound, diminishing the attack capability of the fleet. To inform the analysis, the Air Force supplied Wald with data from the front. Servicemen recorded the number and placement of bullet holes on the fuselage, wings, and tails of all the planes that returned to base.  Returning bombers bore scars concentrated around the tail gunner and the wings.  So, the leaders of the Air Force suggested reinforcing these bullet-riddled regions with armor. Wald vehemently disagreed. The returning planes’ pockmarks showed where the birds were strongest, the places they could suffer injury yet still return to base. The fuselage and wings least needed the armor to survive.  These planes suffered injuries in these regions and return to base regardless. Wald argued this proved these areas weren’t critical. There were tens of thousands of planes that hadn’t returned home because they’d been struck elsewhere: the engines, the tail, and cockpit.  Those areas should be armored more heavily. The oversight by the U.S. Air Force, dubbed survivorship bias, is a cognitive bias that plagues data analysts in all fields. This is an excerpt from a book I co-authored called Winning with Data , and it’s one of the most memorable stories I came across in the use of statistics and the importance of understanding statistical bias.

Average Series A valuations have hovered around $15M for the last 9 quarters. Series B rounds have settled into $50M, while Series C rounds have rebounded to $100M. Later stage rounds, however, have fallen by 50% from their high of $400M to just under $200M. However, in the early stages the frequency of down rounds (e.g., a Series D with a smaller valuation than a Series C) aren’t at historic or even six year highs. Series A down rounds constituted 40% of all rounds in Q1 2009. Today, that figure has touched 23% and compared to the previous three quarters’ average of 7% is certainly a notable spike. But it’s not a compelling if it’s a single data point, because the market reached this level in Q2 2013 and Q1 2012. This spike is a reflection of the expensive seed stage market in the last few years, and is likely a reversion to the mean at that stage. Series B down rounds haven’t increased as a total share. Series C and later down rounds have surged and are higher than recent quarters, but not an aberration when looking at the six year history. In other words, the fundraising market is quite steady and relatively stable. Prices seem to have found at least a temporary plateau. Down rounds with harsher terms including pay-to-play, recapitalizations, redemptions, accruing dividends and greater than 1x liquidation preferences are at some of the friendliest levels in five years. Quick glossary on what those terms mean (Consult your attorney before signing terms sheets!): Pay-to-play : typically happens when an insider is leading the round, this provision asks other insider investors to participate or suffer heavily dilution. This heavy dilution is colloquially referred to as being washed out. Recapitalization : restructure the capitalization table for both preferred and common as part of a financing. This washes out the previous shareholders to start again with a nearly-blank slate. Redemption : an investor can demand the company pay them back the value of their shares at some point in time. Accruing dividends : The equity investment doesn’t just buy shares, but the investment also receives an annual interest rate that is paid out at the shareholder’s request. Accruing means this amount compounds annually. Liquidation preferences : In the case of a 2x liquidation preference, preferred shareholders are paid twice their initial investment and then paid their ratable share of the remaining proceeds. Liquidation preferences can have many different structures and payment mechanisms. They are very important to understand. Cooley’s data indicates the supply of venture capital dollars exceeds founder demand and VCs are competing by continuing to offer very founder friendly terms, even in down rounds.

When you’re selling a SaaS product to a potential customer, you have to convince them switching is worth the effort. And once you’ve sold the product, you have to do the opposite: convince the customer that switching to anything else isn’t worth it. In chemistry, there’s a notion of an activation energy. A Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius coined the term to describe the minimum amount of energy required to start a chemical reaction. The drawing above depicts this idea. How does this idea apply to SaaS? Successful sales teams reduce activation energy. Great customer success teams increase it. First reduce switching costs, then increase them. SaaS buyers consider many different types of costs when contemplating a switch. All of these factors contribute to the inertia of staying with the current vendor. First, the political and social capital cost of championing a change. Salespeople are in the business of selling promotions . But, a bad deployment can have the opposite effect and seriously limit an internal champion’s career. Second, the opportunity cost. Changing CRM, ERP, marketing software, customer success software has many soft costs. All the data from the old system needs to be migrated. Teammates must be trained. Productivity will decline during the transition. Not to mention the time involved in educating and convincing internal constituents to change. Third, financial risk. If a new billing system fails for a few hours, the company loses money. A new hosting provider, a new analytics vendor, a new email marketing platform - failure in any of these products hits the business’ top line. Fourth, functionality costs. Switching to a new vendor might have some benefits, but I may lose some functionality the team values. This is why there’s a mantra that a product has to be 10x better. For many possible internal champions the rewards  bearing these risks and costs must be justified by substantially larger gains. After a customer is won, the customer success team is on point to retain that customer. Behind the scenes, the product and engineering teams improve the product to support the CS team. Their shared responsibility is to increase the activation energy and startups take many different approaches. In addition to the 3 competitive defenses of enduring SaaS companies (network effects, data network effects and platform), SaaS startups increase switching costs by: building a relationship with their champion. In many cases, relationship capital often “saves” customers from churning. Customer appreciation events, user conferences, gifts are all examples of this. customizing the product to a particular customer’s needs and/or providing ongoing service and training cross-selling other products or features so that changing a marketing vendor also means changing an email delivery vendor These are just a sampling of the ways startups increase switching costs after the sale. How a company does it often reflects its values and culture. Activation energy and inertia are things to understand in the sales and customer success functions of SaaS companies. I bet my Chemistry teacher never thought I’d say that!

Channel distribution represents one of the biggest and most important changes in customers acquisition for SMB SaaS startups in quite a while. Historically, channel distribution has been reserved for the most expensive software and hardware. IBM, Intel, Cisco and their kin generate more than 80% of their revenues through a universe of resellers and distributors. As many of these channel partners move to newer distribution models, the brokerage channel model in particular, they represent an efficient and leveraged customer acquisition channel. One of the most interesting examples is Microsoft’s Office 365 SMB business. It’s the most successful SMB SaaS acquisition channel ever built. Microsoft adds 50,000 small businesses as customers each month . Overall, for Microsoft 95% of revenues are derived from channel. “Although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes…distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small- and medium-sized organizations.” Microsoft 2016 Annual Report You can read more about IDC’s analysis of Microsoft’s channel structure here. Thomas Hansen was Worldwide Vice President of SMB at Microsoft. He and his team were instrumental in developing the explosive growth potential of the channel in serving the SMB. Today, he’s replicating that success at Dropbox. Recently, I had an opportunity to chat with Thomas about his experiences and I asked him to write about SMB SaaS channel distribution for this blog because his perspective on the opportunity is unique. After all, he’s built the most success SMB SaaS channel ever. Thank you, Thomas, for sharing your insights. The Channel Distribution Opportunity by Thomas Hansen Modern companies are born in the cloud, and independence is in their DNA.  Many start by following self-service distribution models as a route to market, which have served as the de facto standard for helping cloud businesses grow. With customers coming to their (virtual) doorstep, these cloud companies are free to scale at their own pace, expanding sales and their reach in the marketplace. But sometimes that independence comes at a cost — an opportunity cost. With a self-service model, customers who have more specific needs are left in the cold. As a result, the next step for cloud companies is generally to build their own outbound and inbound sales force as a way to foster and manage relationships with customers. This presents its own challenges, as it typically is resource intensive and at least initially has unit economics that at best is challenging. At this stage many executives ask themselves: “Is there a more efficient way to reach customers?” The answer is not that obvious, but there is a better way. There are approximately 100 million businesses worldwide that are supported by a reseller ecosystem, consisting of half a million reseller companies. These resellers, in turn, employ literally millions of sellers, each effectively operating as an outsourced sales team for the cloud companies they service. Cloud software vendors that operate through partners in the channel are in a position to reach far more markets than they would on their own, and at a much faster pace. And while turning to channel resellers may seem decidedly old-school, working with partners will give cloud companies the agility they need to spread the word about their services on a broader scale, and gain new customers in new markets and new industries, and importantly at unit economics that scale positively fast. Navigating the channel In today’s world, the cloud isn’t just the future — it’s the bedrock on which modern companies are built, and a key component of the business strategies of many titans of the software industry. Let’s look at Microsoft. Four years ago Microsoft launched Office 365, a subscription-based delivery model for their flagship product Office, and turned to partners in the channel to scale worldwide. On their FY 2016 Q4 Earnings call, Microsoft announced that Office 365 revenue was up 54% year over year, with strong adoption across all segments. Additionally, nearly 90,000 channel partners now deliver Office 365 to small and medium businesses around the globe. That’s a 25% increase in channel partners year over year; those partners have contributed to Microsoft’s growth in the market, contributing more than 50,000 customers a month, for 28 consecutive months. Could Microsoft have driven this level of momentum without turning to the channel reseller market? Perhaps. But not without time, and resource-consuming investments to dive headlong into unfamiliar markets, and establishing relations with disparate SMBs who may prefer a more hands-on relationship with a trusted, local advisor. The aforementioned 100 million businesses around the world that turn to a reseller ecosystem do so to embrace the cloud technologies that will help them drive their own futures. In a recent global study by the Boston Consulting Group, small and medium-sized businesses that adopted the latest IT tools and cloud services grew revenue, profitability and jobs measurably faster than their less tech-savvy counterparts. These small, lean organizations often don’t have the resources to field a full IT team, turning instead to their existing relationships in the channel for all of their IT needs. By also turning their attention to the channel, cloud companies can reach these SMBs and extend their reach without overextending their resources. One-size doesn’t fit all The potential extended reach that channel resellers can provide is considerable. Dropbox, for example, works with distribution partners like Ingram Micro, which has a dedicated global cloud team to drive sales readiness and results for SaaS. They’ve also made investments to improve SaaS adoption for their reseller communities. For example, late last year Ingram Micro purchased Odin, an automation platform that streamlines and simplifies the SaaS reseller experience. Through the Odin acquisition, Ingram Micro has gained a fully automated marketplace and can reach even more markets, enabling thousands more resellers. That extended reach means more potential customers for Ingram Micro’s partners. For Dropbox, that partnership with Ingram Micro means being able to go to market with fewer direct costs, and less overhead in the future. The global reseller ecosystem becomes crucial here. With many companies around the world looking for local, trusted reseller partners for IT advice and supply, turning to the channel can help cloud companies like Dropbox scale meaningfully. What’s in it for you: Embrace the channel With SaaS, resellers will deliver value-added services, such as implementation, data migration, training, and customer support. Customers will enjoy lower initial costs, and lower overhead costs thanks to minimal IT needs. And SaaS offers seamless integrations between thousands of products, so resellers can create best in breed solutions that serve their clients best. Early to mid-stage cloud companies are typically also faced with the dilemma of how to expand globally, outside of their core markets. Scaling through the channel, leveraging the global infrastructure of distribution partners, enables you to gain global coverage without having any resources outside of your home market, essentially outsourcing your global channel enablement, marketing, sales and support to a distribution partner. Getting started The notion of when to get engaged, when to start working with a distribution partner isn’t all that obvious. Whilst on the one hand the benefits may seem obvious to your company, there also has to be a clear win-win-win in it for the distribution partners and the resellers. The recipe for when to start a channel program is a function of critical mass of your business, the profitability of your services for the partners as well as the ability of your services to be bundled with other vendors solutions. To get started consider hiring in leadership talent that has worked in the reseller channel before, and who has successfully build a channel program from the ground up before. Moreover, engage with the cloud practices of the leading distribution companies such as Ingram Micro, Synnex, Tech Data Corp. and Westcon. Those simple steps, as well as some basic research to understand industry best practices for how to start, resource and run a channel program, should enable you to getting started. Let’s go The cloud is no longer a mystery. SMBs around the world are embracing the cloud as a means to drive growth and revenue. For cloud companies seeking to maximize their potential and reach businesses whose needs aren’t met by traditional direct outbound sales or self-service models, weaving the channel into SaaS distribution efforts will deliver real results. image credit: Microsoft

There are three pricing strategies for startups. Maximization dominates SaaS products in the mid-market and enterprise markets; penetration is synonymous with freemium in the SMB market. Once you’ve decided on the right strategy for your company, what is the best way to price? By seat? By minute? With or without a platform fee? Modern behavioral economics study three different pricing structures. Let’s contrast them for a hypothetical web analytics vendor. Linear Pricing (LP) - Each analytics event costs $0.10. 2 Part Tariff (2PT) - The analytics software has a base platform fee of $10,000 and each analytics event processed by the system costs $0.10 more. 3 Part Tariff (3PT) - Again, the software has a base platform fee but the fee is $25,000 because it includes the first 150k events are free. Each marginal event costs $0.15. Which is the best for software companies? For the first ten years of SaaS, the linear pricing model dominated. Recently, 2PTs have emerged, but are still uncommon. However, several academics argue the 3PT may be the optimal strategy especially when the number of vendors in a category is small. Professor Yong Chao crafted a game theory simulation of two competitors and tested the three different pricing strategies. We find that a 3PT is always a profitable tool over LP or a 2PT for the dominant firm to compete against its rival, in both cases of perfect substitutes and imperfect substitutes. Strategic Effects of Three-Part Tariffs Under Oligopoly Another surprising conclusion from his analysis: 3PT reduces competition in commodity markets, but increases it in markets with a differentiated product in favor of it. That’s because 3PT pricing mechanisms capture more value from the buyer. SaaS startups with differentiated products can reinforce their competitive strategy with their pricing, aligning the 4Ps of Marketing . 3PTs capture more value because customers tend to buy larger plans than they might need. From a study on consumers buying cell phone plans: Customers choose flat-rate or three-part tariffs with large allowances even when these entail a greater bill than tariffs with a lower allowance The Effect of Tariff Structure on Usage under Two and
Three-Part Tariffs But, the money doesn’t necessarily go to waste. Customers end up using more of the service. “Customers who switched to a three-part tariff increased their usage by 15.1%, while customers who remained on a two-part tariff increased their usage by 0.9%.” And this increase cannot be accounted for with a traditional demand model. “It is consistent, however, with previous research that shows that free goods lead to a positive affective response, hence increase the valuation of the product or service, and consequently, its demand.” One of the most consistent pieces of advice we share with founders is to increase prices of their software products. Software is a kind of Veblen good . As prices increase, so does demand. In the buyer’s mind, the more expensive the product, the more valuable it is. Of course, demand doesn’t increase forever with price. Modern behavioral economics suggest that the most effective way of increasing prices is to structure a logical three part tariff. In addition to achieving more effective value based pricing , 3PTs reinforce competitive advantage and potentially lead to more satisfied customers who may use the product more. Note: the research cited focused on consumer purchasing plans of cell phone products, not software. I’m assuming the buying characteristics of software customers are similar to those of cell phone consumers. I haven’t been able to find studies of software purchasing, but anecdotes from several founders indicates that many of the same principles do apply for their businesses.

Through the end of July in 2016, $70B worth of SaaS companies sold. Their size follows a power law with LinkedIn at $26B and Netsuite at $9.3B. The more than $600B in cash on the balance sheets of large public tech companies combined with a recent pricing correction in SaaS companies presaged a flurry of acquisition activity. But it hasn’t unfolded as expected in three different ways. First, 15 of the 22 US software acquisitions worth more than $0.5B have been public companies. Excluding LinkedIn, nearly 5x more dollars have been spent on acquiring public companies. The largest private software acquisition is Transfirst, a payment software business founded in 1995. It’s the 7th largest this year. The second largest, Jasper, is an internet of things software company founded in 2004, which Cisco acquired for $1.2B. Jasper ranks eleventh. Second, there are no unicorns among the names. Perhaps the fastest growing software companies aren’t interested in selling, yet. More important, public companies may be more attractive buys than their private peers. In 2015, our internal analysis showed private SaaS companies commanded twice the valuation-to-multiple revenue of the public markets. If that still holds, then an acquirer can buy a dollar of revenue at half the cost in the public markets - a much better deal. Third, private equity firms have become voracious buyers and they are paying similar prices to strategics. This new behavior is a shift in strategy for private equity firms. Traditionally, PE firms buy a software company in the late stages of the company’s life at a much lower multiple. They cut costs to drive up profitability, inject their own management teams, lever the acquisition using debt, and then sell or take the company public in a few years to generate a return. In 2016, these PE firms aren’t following that playbook. They are buying companies at 8x revenues (Cvent and Marketo), which are well above the median publicly traded SaaS company EV/TTM Revenue multiple of 5.5x. The 2016 software buying spree hasn’t benefitted private startups or unicorns yet, and that reflects the different strategies of the buyers. Large incumbent technology companies including Oracle, Salesforce, Microsoft are buying large public companies with dominant market share to bolster their current businesses and expand to new markets. And though they are paying premiums relative to the public market averages, these prices are likely more economical than a private acquisition. Private equity firms are experimenting with a new, debt-free, buy-and-hold model, where the valuation matters and a potentially quick IPO is key to the exit strategy. Perhaps after many of the $1-$10B public SaaS companies have been acquired, we’ll begin to see more consolidation in the private market. But it’s not happening yet.

McKinsey released a study of high growth software companies entitled Grow Fast or Die Slow . One salient conclusion: If a software company grows at 20% annually, it has a 92 percent chance of ceasing to exist within a few years. In other words, software companies must grow quickly to survive. Slow growing businesses suffer from the lack of oxygen that fuels growth. Raising money is more expensive. Hiring becomes challenging. Without the capacity to invest capital in growth or the ability to compete for top talent, the slow growth cycle reinforces itself. The McKinsey study breaks down rapid growth into two parts. In part one, the authors identify five key factors of success in the early stages. Large market; logical revenue model; rapid-adoption; stealth/secrecy; proper compensation of the leadership team. This list will surprise no one, except perhaps for stealth. Is secrecy and stealth a prerequisite to success for every massive software company? For most bottoms-up businesses, stealth isn’t a competitive advantage, but awareness is. Part two is more interesting. The defining characteristic  of enduring software businesses is they “master the transition from one act to the next.” Fast-growth startups must metamorphose constantly because the market demands it of them. One founder described the transition this way: First, I was one of a few founders. As we grew, I became a manager of people. Then a manager of managers. And now I’m a manager of managers of managers. Another founder, Tien Tzuo, talks about the breaking points of management that occur at 8 employees, 57 employees, and 400 employees. Regardless of how these changes are described, a startup has to navigate these changes well because it’s critical to sustaining the value of the business. Companies whose growth rate fell off and then recovered created less than a quarter of the value of the companies that maintained growth…Bankers call this the “humpty dumpty” problem: once growth is broken, it is impossible to put back together again. Though there is some truth to the assertion, the Humpty Dumpty characterization is overly broad. To cite one critical counterexample, Concur’s rapid revenue growth in 2006 and 2007 occurred after nearly a decade of tepid expansion. Second winds aren’t uncommon. One third of the software companies analyzed by McKinsey returned to their previous growth rates. Startups must sustain annual growth rates of greater than 20% annually to survive. The faster a company grows and the better the management team anticipates, prepares for, and manages the transitions from seedling to sapling to enduring business, the more valuable the business will be.

Where is the budget to pay for your SaaS startup’s software coming from? There are three possible pockets. First, they are dollars the competitor you displaced used to collect. Second, the company enlarges the current budget to finance the purchase. Third, the company creates a new budget. Which budget is an important question. The answer informs product, marketing and sales strategy. It’s also a frequent question investors and employee candidates will ask during their respective processes. Replacing competitors is budget displacement. The total dollars spent in the category remains the same, but the recipient of those dollars changes. Budget displacement implies strong competition for a fixed or possibly declining dollar amount. “We have $50k to spend per year on our data warehouse.” Whether that data warehouse is in the cloud, on premises, or has some new features likely won’t impact the buyer’s budget. Budget expansion implies the total amount of spending on software increases. JP Morgan doubled its security budget from $250M to $500M from 2015 to 2016. Every security company should be calling them because they already have internal approval for new software. The security market as a whole is forecasted to grow 10-12% annually, which means there is substantial budget expansion broadly. In contrast, the sum total of IT spend in 2015 fell by 5% and will remain flat in 2016, according to Gartner . New budget creation is rare, but it does happen. Ten years ago, asking a CIO the size of his Hadoop budget or Customer Success software would have drawn blank stares. Today, that’s a different story. New budget creation often demands creating a new category - a huge task of educating companies on the virtues and rewards of the investment. The origin of your revenue is an important one for another reason: the question leads the company to discover who controls the budget. That person is the ultimate decision-maker and a key constituent to identify, educate and court in the sales process. From which budget does your revenue originate?

What is the smallest price point at which a SaaS startup can justify building an inside sales team? This is a natural question that many SaaS startups raise as they begin to complement bottoms-up, product-led adoption with assisting customers through the sales process. There are publicly traded SaaS companies at nearly every price point - even very small ones. At IPO, Wix went public with an average annual revenue per customers of $87. Xero at $167; RingCentral $352. Ticker ACV Market Cap, $B WIX 87 1.3 XRO 167 2.7 CTCT 265 1.1 LOGM 314 1.6 RNG 352 1.6 ZEN 1801 2.6 SPSC 3259 1.1 ATLS 5554 6.0 HUBS 6094 1.9 TRAK 6777 4.0 FLTX 6788 1.7 ATHN 7721 5.5 NEWR 8027 1.8 But not all of these lend themselves to the classic sales development representative-to-inside sales model canonized in Predictable Revenue because of two constraints: customers-to-quota and cash. Let’s take the example of an inside sales account executive with a $500k annual quota. At a $500 price point, between RingCentral and Zendesk, that AE would need to sell 1000 customers per year, 83 per month, 4.2 per working day. There are some amazingly productive salespeople, but those velocity figures are stratospheric - and unrealistic. Given that constraint, a sales team might reduce quota to $300k, but that reduces the number of customers per month to 50 or 2.5 per day. Why not lower quotas further? Cash. At a $300k annual quota and a fully loaded cost per AE of $100k, the account executive generates $200k of revenue over their costs. That’s not very efficient. Quota $300k $400k $500k $600k Number of Reps Needed to Book $10M 44 33 27 22 Annual Opex of the Sales Team,$M 4.4 3.3 2.7 2.2 As the table above shows, to close $10M in bookings with at a $300k quota and a 75% quota attainment rate requires 2x the annual cash investment as the same business with a $500k quota. Lower quotas are possible, but they require a startup to raise more capital to attain the same bookings number and growth rate. At lower price points, self-signup and scalable customer support/success models are more prevalent because the economics can’t justify sales team involvement. These customer acquisition mechanisms rely on product, self education and high volume customer support to convert users to paid accounts. Many startups prefer to field sales teams on accounts that are $3k+ because the velocities are sustainable and the quotas are attainable.

Over the last year, the amount of series A investment in US startups has fallen by nearly 33% from a high of $6 billion to about $4 billion in Q2 2016. Later stage investments have followed a similar path. Curiously, the series B/Expansion stage market has witnessed remarkable resilience, continuing to increase despite volatility. The series a market is also seen a similar drop in the total number of investments, indicating a slower investment pace. Later and expansion rounds have remained relatively constant. Series A average round sizes have fallen from their highs of just over 10 million. Later stage rounds are also falling in size. Meanwhile, series Bs spiked. In terms of sector trends, software continues its rise with nearly $10 billion invested in Q2 2016. Meanwhile consumer businesses raise less than $2 billion, a far cry from the nearly $4.8 billion raised in Q3 2015. Software investments represent 64% of all venture dollars in the US, reaching all-time highs for the past six years. In short, this is a venture market in flux. The series A market is undoubtedly in decline. The series B market is booming. And later stage rounds are falling. Those trends seem incongruous, but I have a theory. Series B prices have witnessed the largest correction in the past few quarters. Because of that repricing, investors focusing at that stage are finding plenty of companies to back at attractive valuations. Meanwhile, the later stage investments are slowing because of the challenging private market, and multiple compression in the stock market. The Series A market seems to be catching its breath after an all-out sprint from 2013 to mid-2015. The shift to software investment is undeniable. And curiously, it comes at a time when the rates of software company formation are in decline, about 18% fewer companies year over year. Now seems to be a great time to raise a series B round, because there’s plenty of capital. Unfortunately this data doesn’t shed light into the valuations of those rounds. Also, the data would suggest that series A are harder to round, but I know from first-hand experience that there is plenty of Series A capital waiting for the right investment opportunity. So, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a resurgence later this year. That’s the challenge of trying to predict the future patterns of the market using previous data:  There are so many different forces at play that it’s hard to isolate a single contribute factor whether it’s company formation, valuations, or investor sentiment. From my seat, it feels like the Series A market is relatively stable, but hungry for new, exciting investment opportunity. Source:NVCA/MoneyTree Data

The last time I learned a new programming language was 2004. I had been writing in Java for about four years, and then I heard whispers of a new framework called Rails that allowed engineers to write web applications in one-tenth the time of a Java web application. Over the course of a few weeks, I bought an armful of paper books, read them, and worked through the examples. A few weeks later, I built my first Rails application and brought it to work at Google. But learning a new programming language today is a completely different affair. I’ve been trying to learn Google’s new language Go for the past few years. I didn’t succeed with my first attempt and I came away frustrated by the learning curve in 2013. Over the fourth of July, I resolved to see this through. Again, I downloaded a handful of books on Go from Github and read them, this time on Kindle. Then I started to write an app to pull data from Mailchimp, enrich it with Clearbit and store it in a database. Pretty quickly, I hit a wall. My app wouldn’t parse the Mailchimp data. So I turned the internet, googled online coding help and came across CodeMentor. Within 15 minutes, I was online with a seasoned engineer who was editing my code from his laptop four thousand miles away and pointing out my errors. Instead of spending several hours searching through forums, asking questions, or calling friends, I had a functional app. Cost: $15. Time savings: 4-6 hours. I have read about the dislocations in education, from online courses like Khan Academy to bootcamps from General Assembly and Bloc. But this was the first time I’ve ever experienced the potential of the Internet to transform learning. The instant response and help from CodeMentor gave me a feeling of progress and momentum - a critical part of what makes learning enjoyable. Plus, there’s the human connection of someone earnestly trying to help me. No social capital required. It’s empowering: What couldn’t I learn without that type of help? How to integrate a function. How to use Adobe Photoshop. How to write an API parser for Mailchimp. Learning both in traditional institutions and in the workplace will be transformed over the next ten years. This little Go project helped me see and feel how much better it will be than even ten years ago.

There’s a perpetual and roaring debate in Startupland about the ideal founding team. Should the ideal team be entirely computer scientists? How important to success is having an MBA/business person? What about the stories of billionaire dropouts? To answer that question, I’ve aggregated the academic backgrounds of 30 of the top startups of the past few years and analyzed the make up of each of those founding teams. Above is a chart comparing the number of “billion” dollar startups by the total number of founders and the share of technical founders. The full dataset is here. Here are the key observations of this data: The average founding team has 2.4 founders; the median is 2 70% of teams have at least one technical founder 40% of teams are exclusively computer scientists 30% of teams have no technical cofounders 15% of founders have dropped out of an undergraduate or graduate degree program 10% of founders have an MBA The sample size here is small, only 30, and by definition each one of these companies is an exception. But a few patterns emerge from the data. First, there is no clear correlation between the fraction of technical founders and the ultimate success of the business. In this data set, there are an equal number of successful non-technical teams as technical teams as semi-technical teams. The share is split a third to each. Second, there are as many dropouts as MBAs among these teams, which asks more questions about education than it answers. Third, looking through the data, there is a slight bias towards technical teams in enterprise companies particularly where technology is the main differentiator. No surprise there. But in the consumer world and in software as a service, there seems to be no patterns. For every Pinterest, there’s an Uber; for every Box.net, there’s a Workday. The data confirmed what I believe: great founding teams can come from anywhere .

In addition to increasing labor costs, startups in San Francisco are facing monotonically increasing real estate prices. JLL the real estate broker shared their data on the average asking rent in San Francisco from 2007 two 2016, year to date. In 2009, the average asking rent was $31.37. In 2016 that number has more than doubled to $73.05, for an average annual increase of just about 13%. The most expensive neighborhood in San Francisco is Mission Bay/China basin at approximately $85 per square foot per year for class A real estate, followed by South market for an average of $80 per square foot. Rising prices reflect an increase of demand. Total vacancy rate has dropped to 8% from a high in 2010 a 17.1%, meaning only 8% of available spaces are available to be rented. But the trend does show some signs of slowing. The chart above shows net absorption of real estate. A positive number indicates more real estate was leased than was vacated and was built. From 2011 two 2015 we’ve seen more than 1.4M sq. ft. per year, with recent years exceeding 2M sq. ft. But 2016 is on track to be the lowest in six years at an annual rate of just about 1M sq. ft. New leasing activity in 2016 is on track to be about 69% of 2015. This decline in absorption and leaning activity has decreased the year on year average asking rent in gross dollar terms already, and suggests that at least plateau is near, if not a decline in prices. This decline in demand for real estate reflects a changing fundraising environment where many startups are conserving cash, shifting plans to profitability rather than growth at any cost. Perhaps at some point in the not-too-distant future, the startups will also begin to benefit from decreasing prices of San Francisco real estate. Source: JLL

The next big shift in SaaS is an evolution from software as a service as a displacer to a disruptor. Displacement technologies compete with incumbents on the same buying parameters. Disruptive companies change the way a buyer thinks about solving their need. Most SaaS products today are displacers. SaaS products initially were viewed as a cheaper, often inferior product to their client/server peers. Five or ten years ago, that may have been true. But today, SaaS companies generate upwards of 15% of all the software revenue and are consistently ousting their older competitors. Most of that revenue, though, is displacement revenue. Whether it is displacing an existing CRM system or pen and paper, modern software companies still compete on the same buying parameters. For example, a CRM’s ability to be customized and its integrations characterize its attractiveness to a buyer. A simple way of dividing the software world is system of record vs workflow application. Systems of record are the single source of truth about a particular department or company. A CRM is the canonical source of sales information; the ERP system is the canonical source of a company’s financial information. Systems of record are valued for their ability to generate reports and insight to the company’s management team, but not renowned for their user-friendliness. On the other hand, workflow applications enable workers to do work. The products that appeal to salespeople, sales development reps, marketing associates, customers support reps are the most successful. Most SaaS companies leverage the distribution advantage of the web browser to pursue bottoms up customer acquisition.  In order to win a user using this bottoms up strategy, these software companies pursued workflow value proposition. There are exceptions: Salesforce, NetSuite, Workday. Some make the transition from workflow application to system of record. Zendesk is a good example of this as it moves up the market from serving small to medium businesses to midmarket to enterprise system of record for customer service requests. But all of these examples are still about displacement. The parameters of decision-making remain the same. The next shift in SaaS will see startups leverage their workflow roots into disrupting systems of record by changing the buying process. The data they will aggregate from this usage will provide unique insight that preceding systems of record cannot furnish. For example: can today’s CRM technology tell a CEO exactly how much time a company is spending to close an account and support that account over time? And ultimately whether or not the client is a profitable client? Being a workflow product is a fundamental strategic advantage for a SaaS company, because it provides the business a vantage point invisible to incumbents. We haven’t yet seen many workflow applications unseat system of record incumbents, but by leveraging this strategic advantage and changing the buying process, new SaaS companies will evolve from displacement to disruption.

Salesforce’s initial public offering in 2003 demarcated the beginning of a new era, the era of Software as a Service. In the 13 years that followed, many startups have followed their path to build innovative software that has transformed their respective industries and sectors. The shift has been revolutionary both in software delivery as well as sales. It’s not an understatement to say everything has changed. More than 15% of all software revenue is now generated by software as a service companies, and there are more than 50 publicly traded SaaS companies today. After more than a decade of reinvention, I was curious how healthy the IPO market is for SaaS companies. According to the data, 2016 has the potential to be the worst SaaS IPO year in six. The chart above plots the number of SaaS IPOs. In 2003, Salesforce kicked things off. By 2007 there were five IPOs and that number crested at nine in 2013 and 2014. The IPO market in the second half of 2015 was more challenging but still seven companies went public. So far in 2016, there is only one. In gross dollar terms, SaaS companies raised more than $1.5 billion in 2012, the highest mark ever. Since that scene is, the amount is fallen to $1.3 billion then to $1.1 billion and $0.6 billion in the subsequent three years. Throughout that turbulence, the median amount raised by a SaaS company going public has remained constant at roughly $108 million. Like any other sector, SaaS IPOs are affected by broader macro trends, and we’re likely seeing some of that in the number of offerings declining over the past 24 – 36 months. With the public market increasingly focused on near-term path to profitability, the financial profiles of pre-IPO SaaS companies may shift compared to the a few years ago in order to achieve those milestones. But, given the number of SaaS companies already at scale, I expect to see quite a few more IPOs or the next few years, that hopefully will reverse the trend of declining number of IPOs and amount raised.

On the prospects list of every SaaS startup, you will find a list of company names and next to them a projected dollar amount projecting the potential revenue from closing the deal. Each line item might represent a sale to team, department or the entire company. Regardless, there is a single champion advocating internally for the company to invest in this software product. If the project succeeds, that person will be promoted. Salespeople are in the business of selling promotions. That marketing automation tool is valuable because it can meaningfully increase the lead velocity rate of the marketing team. A marketer who exceeds lead volume expectations is worth every penny of a promotion. CRM promises sales leaders better sales predictions, and the VP of sales who consistently hits her numbers eventually will be promoted to SVP or CRO. The controller of a business who consistently closes the books ahead of schedule and accurate to the cent, because of the deployment of a new ERP system, has set their gaze set on one goal: CFO. Ultimately, software is purchased by an individual on behalf of a corporation. Behind the logo on the lead list is a person. That champion stakes some part of their reputation on the investment they beseech the company to make. Successful sales people sell promotions. They articulate a value proposition to the potential buyer that aligns the incentives of the buyer with a value proposition offered by the startup’s product. This tactic has the additional benefit of creating urgency within the prospect. Who doesn’t want to be promoted faster? The same idea can be used in reverse when researching a startup idea. It’s critical to understand whether or not the risk to the internal champion is worth the reward. If a hypothetical startup sells a core piece of infrastructure that offers similar performance to the in-hospital software, but risks downtime, the risk reward trade-offs simply isn’t worth it for anyone internally. This is the origin of the 10 X rule, that software must be 10 times better than its replacement. 10X better software tilts the risk reward balance in favor of new software. In addition, if no one within a potential buyer organization is willing to take the risk, this might be a sign that the startup’s software is not high priority enough within the organization, so taking the risk wouldn’t result in a promotion for the internal champion. Why bother? The key to selling promotions is understanding how the target buyer is goaled and rewarded within the company. This is why many successful salespeople ask questions about goals, priorities and internal culture. They are trying to reverse engineer the promotion. Do your product, marketing and sales efforts sell promotions? Image credit: Cai Guo-Qiang “Sky Ladder” Made of Fireworks

I’ve been reading Robert Greene’s book Mastery. Greene has amassed biographies of tens of great people from Henry Ford to Paul Graham, from Alexander the Great to Larry Page. Across many of them, he identifies two common paths to mastery: mentorship and grit. The story of Leonardo da Vinci captures both ideas. Da Vinci was born out of wedlock and was prohibited from attending school. His father, a notary, had access to a large supply of paper which was a rare commodity at the time. With all of his free time, Leonardo would walk through the forests of Vinci and draw. Andrea Del Verrochio hired Leonardo as an apprentice because of the great quality of his drawings. Da Vinci would learn many different sciences under his mentor, and over time he burnished his reputation as an artist. However, he was snubbed in the competition for painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Lorenzo de Medici didn’t like Leonardo because of his undistinguished education. Frustrated by the system of artist patronage, Leonardo vowed to make a living in other ways. He developed an innovative process to forge the largest bronze statue built in hundreds of years. And he pursued hundreds of inventions including helicopters, parachutes, and a giant crossbow. The combination of an education from a leading expert and grit led Leonardo da Vinci to greatness. His education provided da Vinci with insights into how the world worked, and his resolve pushed him to change the world to meet his vision. Many entrepreneurs also have the same combination of great mentors and grit. Sometimes they find great mentors after they started their businesses. Other times, these entrepreneurs have been mentored before they found a business. A few times in my life, I have been privileged to have amazing mentors and all of those experiences share something in common. Those people helped me learn something about myself that I couldn’t have without them: they pushed me to start a business, they challenged me to carry a quota, they offered me an opportunity in venture capital. I suspect all great founders and CEOs are supported by a network of great mentors. Most of these mentorship relationships are hidden in the shadows, not often mentioned. But that lack of visibility belies their critical importance.

LinkedIn. Twitter. Facebook. Asana. RelateIQ. Slack. 3 Email Accounts. Each of those is an inbox, an implicit or explicit to do list. If I count the feed and the messaging products as separate inboxes, I have a grand total of 12 inboxes for work. 12 things to check first thing and last thing. How many do you have? I look at that number 12 and it’s astounding to me that I have that many, but I don’t think the figure will decline any time soon. Each inbox serves its own purpose reaching a different audience in the case of social inboxes, managing work tasks or just replying to email, the universal communication protocol. At Google, I worked in the AdSense Operations team. We had an internal emailing product that helped us serve hundreds of thousands of customers. We were trained on canned responses, measured on email turn-around-time (TAT) and customer satisfaction. Those metrics focused the team on the metrics that mattered for the business. But there’s no equivalent set of metrics for a business inbox. Twitter doesn’t offer data on how quickly we should respond to Tweets to maximize reach or influence; nor does LinkedIn or Facebook. Email offers no insight into the expected response time to either party. Email’s most insightful bit of feedback is the read receipt. What would happen if these inboxes tacitly communicated status of each item to the sender? Or informed us how and when to respond to them? Or even suggested responses?

The rate of new software company formation seems to have declined materially in the past few years. In 2011-2013, about 1450 software companies were founded each year on average. In 2014, that figure fell to 1186 and in 2015, we count 481. Why does Crunchbase data indicate this decline? First, there might be a few data issues in the most recent years. Perhaps software companies remain in stealth longer. Perhaps there a substantial delay between when the business is founded and when it appears in Crunchbase. However, Pitchbook analysis corroborates this trend . This is counterintuitive considering the broader venture capital backdrop of near record venture investment in software . In addition, the sheer size of the Martech landscape growing to more than 3500 companies up from 150 in 2011 implies torrid growth as well. But if we assume the 2014 cohort is accurate, then the data suggests an 18% drop in software company formation. Why could this be? First, the competitive intensity has increased in each segment. The overlapping logos in the Martech landscape visualize the lack of oxygen in some of these segments. Second, the key systems of record in SaaS are already in place. Salesforce, Netsuite, Marketo/Eloqua/Pardot/Hubspot, Zendesk. Subverting those incumbents is going to require a meaningfully better product or substantially more effective customer acquisition channel. We haven’t really seen a discontinuity of the magnitude SaaS presented to server/client, yet. The promise of mobile remains only somewhat fulfilled. Machine learning in SaaS is nascent. Chat bots, too, are early. Third, the recent concentration of seed investments in fewer companies might contribute to a decreased rate of founding. Seed round volumes in 2016 have halved compared to 2015, but increased in median size by 40%. According to this data set, startup formation fell 11% over the same time period, but software company formation fell nearly twice as much at 18%.  If it is a long term trend, it means less competition for new founders. Source: Crunchbase data, and Pitchbook data (thanks Mikey Tom!)

What is the optimal pricing strategy for a start up? That depends. It depends on at least three other variables: the product, the placement, the positioning. Combined with price, these are the four 4Ps of marketing created by Dr. E. Jerome McCarthy,  former professor of marketing at Michigan State and Notre Dame. Also called the marketing mix , these four variables need to be aligned when determining pricing for your startup. Apple serves as a great example of a company whose marketing mix is aligned and consistent. The company positions itself in the market as a premium brand. It builds products of the highest quality often with innovative and novel manufacturing techniques. Apple sells its products in glorious, well lit and modern stores. And it’s price points top the market. The same idea holds in SaaS. A bottoms up company like Expensify requires a different marketing mix than a premium software company like Workday. Price - Expensify employs a penetration pricing plan, using freemium strategy to build groundswell within organizations and ultimately close the entire company as a customer. Product The product is built with this strategy in mind, and differentiates itself in the market with the friendliest user experience in the market, which is how the product will initially be evaluated by these ultimate evangelists. Placement Expensify distributes its applications in the places these consumers will look for them, namely mobile app stores. Positioning Expensify markets itself as an irreverent brand, a marketing message that resonates with the individual users who in a sense ‘rebel’ and choose a different expense management product. We cannot set price in a vacuum. The pricing strategy has to reflect the strategy of the three other components in the marketing mix. A premium price point slapped on product with a bargain positioning won’t work. Customers will be confused. As startups scale and address incremental customer segments, the marketing mix becomes more complex.  When a startup moves from serving the SMB segment to the midmarket to the enterprise, messaging must change because enterprise buyers care about different things including security, large user base management, compliance and other features that small to medium businesses never consider. If a startup decides to sell their product through a channel partner in addition to their direct sales team, they add another layer of complexity. They must market a product through another organization, change the pricing model for that channel partner, and explain to the market when to buy directly and went to buy through the channel partner, in order to assure the partner’s success. In addition to all the changes within the company the ecosystem evolves as well. A new premium entrant might enter the market, changing the market dynamics, forcing incumbents to respond and change their 4Ps. The iPhone 6S was released after Samsung’s phablet success, for example. There are no simple answers when it comes to marketing mix. There are many different factors to consider, but a framework like the 4Ps can help prioritize the discussion.

As a SaaS startup scales from finding initial product market fit to building its go to market organization, one of the most important goals in building that go to market organization is developing a multifaceted marketing team. Marketing’s role in SaaS sales has expanded to the success of SaaS companies as customers prefer to educate themselves more than they have in the past. Many early-stage management teams perceive marketing to be limited to two functions: demand generation and brand building. But that is a myopic perspective which fails to appreciate the complexity of the subject. Bill Macaitis, former CMO at Zendesk and current CMO at Slack, counts nine different marketing disciplines :  content marketing, paid acquisition, evangelism, communications, customer lifecycle marketing, product marketing, website conversion optimization, analytics and international expansion. There might even be a few more including analyst relations, events and channel. That’s quite a lot of expertise required from one department - and it doesn’t just appear overnight. Many early stage SaaS companies focus on a single channel of customer acquisition at the outset. That might be Facebook ads, content marketing, app stores, or evangelism. At some point, the demands of company will outstrip the capacity of the channel to supply leads. For some companies, this channel saturation occurs relatively early on, perhaps under $10M in annual recurring revenue.  Other companies might reach tens of millions of revenue. Regardless of when it happens, it will happen.  To build an enduring company, the business must be prepared for that inevitability by diversifying its marketing efforts. The most effective marketing teams develop go to market cocktails, combinations of strategies that enable the company to continue to grow consistently as it scales. As the cost per click on Google or Facebook increase with intensifying competition, these marketing teams lean on content marketing, referrals or channel-driven leads to hit their numbers. More importantly, these marketing teams develop these skills before they need them. After all, the marketing strategies of one company cannot simply be copied and pasted into another business. Optimal marketing isn’t an off-the-shelf product, but a bespoke suit tailor-made to a business. Marketing is a balance of art and science, an equilibrium between the right message and the right medium. Marketers experiment to discover and sustain the balance, in the midst of a dynamic marketplace. As competition intensifies, industry trends evolve, and the company’s product and positioning in the market advance, marketing must readjust, retool and retune. Diversifying the team’s skills early on is a fundamental strategic advantage for SaaS companies. Invest in it before your business needs it.

The acquisition frenzy continues in SaaS. This morning Microsoft announced it would acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, which prices the business at 8 .1x trailing 12 month revenues and 6.7x next 12 month revenues. In addition, Symantec announced that it would acquire Blue Coat for $4.7 billion, a 7.7x trailing multiple.  In the 2016 acquisition market, the median acquisition multiple is 7.8x  trailing 12 month revenue and 6.4x next 12 month revenue. The LinkedIn acquisition in particular is a strategic move by Microsoft. Salesforce and LinkedIn had often danced around the idea of partnering, to infuse CRM data using LinkedIn information. With the acquisition of LinkedIn’s data set, Microsoft will have an opportunity to both continue to grow the existing business by selling it through its channels, differentiate its CRM product, Dynamics, and offer a sales productivity tool in Sales Navigator. Also, LinkedIn operates a monopoly on resume and employment data and, the business unit can be operated very profitably. Last, the great management team at LinkedIn will complement Microsoft’s. This acquisition will have three implications for startups. First, the transaction informs future M&A multiples. Second, the acquisition has the potential to upend the CRM market. Salesforce + RelateIQ and Microsoft Dynamics + LinkedIn. Two leading CRM products with some form of intelligent data entry; and that raises the question, Will being a CRM system of record without intelligence be enough to succeed? Third, this likely removes LinkedIn from the buyer segment of the M&A market as the company works through its sale. With nearly $40B in SaaS M&A so far this year, 2016 is shaping up to be the best year for SaaS M&A ever. All these data points are helpful to startups. These acquisitions set pricing comparables for the market, and will be used as benchmarks for future acquisitions. As the chart above shows, the highest correlated factor to acquisition multiple in 2016 is cash flow margin. Revenue growth follows, and gross margin is third. Net income (profitability) is last.  This is not surprising. Pacific Crest, an investment bank specializing in software companies, released this analysis at the Gainsight Pulse conference showing the correlation between free cash flow and enterprise value to next 12 month multiple. This means that public software companies are buying private ones using the same metrics as public investors. Company Price Revenue $M Annual Growth Rate Gross Margin NI Margin FCF Margin TTM/Rev NTM/Rev OPower 552 149 16% 62% -30% -12% 3.6x 3.3x Textura 683 92 35% 82% -16% -16% 7.7x 6.0x Marketo 1795 226 38% 66% -32% -5% 7.9x 6.2x Demandware 2858 237 43% 71% -17% 5% 12.1x 9.0x Qlik 2865 631 11% 85% -5% 13% 4.5x 3.9x BlueCoat 4650 598 -5% 71% -48% 16% 7.7x LinkedIn 26,166 3214 35% 86% -5% -8% 8.1x 6.7x The LinkedIn acquisition is very likely the largest SaaS acquisition we’ll see for quite a while. In fact, it’s the largest software acquisition ever. And its effects will be felt for a long time to come. Disclosure: Redpoint and I hold LinkedIn shares.

Which are the ripest areas for startups to disrupt using machine learning? At the core, machine learning/artificial intelligence relies on two key ingredients: advanced algorithms and data sets to train those algorithms. Novel algorithms are increasingly making their way into the public domain in the form of open-source libraries. So, the key differentiator for startups and ultimately long-term competitive advantage is access to proprietary data sets. In the consumer world, there are natural and intrinsic monopolies at play. Google’s search has a natural feedback mechanism of users clicking on the best search results that results in Google continuing to have the best search. Facebook’s network effects of it social network, in combination with its strategic acquisitions of other fast-growing social networks like Instagram and WhatsApp, reinforce its natural monopoly. Both of these companies proprietary access to user data have helped them establish market dominance in the online/mobile advertising world. Google and Facebook run first party ads on their core websites, and use that information to power marketplace and also run an ad network. With a God’s eye view of the entire ad ecosystem, Google and Facebook can train the best algorithms to optimize revenues. Everyone else is at a colossal and unsurmountable disadvantage. Consumer speech recognition is a similar story. Ok Google, Alexa, Siri, and Cortana benefit from the massive distribution advantages of their parent companies. As millions of users continue to provide data to the systems, the language models improve and with it accuracy. As a startup, it’s hard to compete with access to that kind of a data set. But in the enterprise world, natural monopolies are far fewer for many reasons. First, software buyers actively seek to prevent single vendor lock-in; hence the rise of open source. Second, there are far fewer viral/social feedback loops. Third, it’s rare to find software that improves the more customers use it in a way that Google search improves as more people query. Consequently, proprietary data sources that are essential to train next-generation machine learning models are easier to amass in enterprise rather than consumer. The most persistent and longest-running example of this is the security space, where many startups have built lists of exploits and attacks. Because these attacks evolve over time, no single company owns a monopoly on the exploit database. In addition, the enterprise world is a bit behind the consumer world in that there are many data sets whose value is not yet recognized. Few companies run long-term regressions on human resources information systems (HRIS) data, the way that Facebook models user interests spreading through social network. We are just beginning to see the advent of predictive lead scoring tools for sales development representatives. Because the data sets are far more fragmented, because the buyer population prefers to see multiple vendors, because the application of machine learning in the enterprise world is nascent, and because the incumbents aren’t investing heavily in these technologies yet, it will be easier for B2B startups to amass proprietary training data as a competitive advantage than B2C startups. It’s not that we won’t see innovation in the consumer world. But to get there  requires building an enormous customer base with a proprietary data set, that none of the incumbents can replicate or proxy.

How does a chat bot company transform a technology advantage into a distribution advantage? This is the key question facing startups in this part of the ecosystem. Deep learning is advancing at an incredible rate. Google has released TensorFlow and Parsey McParseface . These advances will improve natural language understanding, enabling chat interfaces to amaze and delight users. So let’s assume that the technology works. Let’s take for granted that despite the myriad ways a human can ask a question, the computer will understand the query. And let’s also assume that on top of the messaging platforms, these chat services flourish. Distribution resembles that of the early days of the iTunes Store, when users were rapt to try out new products and startups aggregated massive user basis overnight. Then what? In the SaaS world, to generate meaningful revenue per user/account and to create an enduring business, startups often become a system of record – the canonical store of a particular kind of data. Salesforce is the system of record for client information.  Zendesk is the system of record for customer support; Marketo for marketing; Github for code and so on. Can a startup transform user acquisition momentum and innovative technology to become a system of record?  Is a change in user interface  compelling enough to engender a user groundswell in the company that clamors for change? This has happened in the past with B2C2B businesses with companies like Expensify  and Dropbox. This go to market is David and Goliath reincarnated. Objections like why not buy IBM/the gold standard? are bound to arise. After all, the custom  And the best counterargument to that objection is broad internal adoption and usage, because the failing of most systems of record is their data is inaccurate or out of date. Chat bots can be a disruptive go to market strategy, and a handful of them will break out, amass collections of ardent supporters who champion the products internally, and ultimately subvert existing systems of record. But it won’t be easy.

When is the right time to increase sales headcount for a SaaS startup? It is one of the most strategic decisions for early-stage business to make given the amount of effort and expense involved in building, managing and scaling a sales team. While there is no single absolute sign, neither qualitative nor quantitative, these are some of the signals I have found indicate it might be a good time to scale sales. First, the pipeline to quota ratio exceeds 6X. This means that there is more than enough leads to satisfy the quota requirement for one sales rep. Pipeline to quota ratio indicates the amount of business available to close within a certain time period, a month or a quarter. If the typical sales rep to close 15 – 18% of leads,  then to attain quota, the account executive needs 5x-6x the number of leads as total quota. This ratio may not be applicable for the small set of companies whose sales cycles are less than 30 days, however. Second, customers are buying the product ahead of key features or industry-standard features. This kind of pull from the market irrespective of a product’s maturity means the business has built a product that is a top priority for their customers. Third, the company is observing shortening sales cycles or very short sale cycles. Fast sales cycles correspond to execution sales, when account executives don’t need to educate the market, rather they just need to finalize the contracts. I’m sure there are other signs that it is time to scale sales team, but these are the ones that I have seen most frequently. When a SaaS startup decides it’s time to invest in growing the sales team, the typical goals of that investment are three. First, discover the profile of a successful account executive at the company. Second, establish hiring costs, ramp times and quotas for salespeople so the company can model its growth costs. Third, codify sales motions into a playbook that includes a pitch, objection handling, and competitive advantages. As a SaaS startup begins to hire salespeople, it’s also critical to remember that salespeople alone do not constitute a go to market organization. To be successful, they require sales development representatives, marketing support, and customer success/post sales. Each of these units is called the fundamental unit of growth and modeling their costs is critical to ensuring the success of the sales investment too.

Three billion dollar SaaS acquisitions were announced this week with Salesforce paying $2.9B for DemandWare, an eCommerce platform provider, Vista Equity Partners paying $1.8B for Marketo, the marketing automation company, and Thoma Bravo buying Qlik, a business intelligence companies for $2.9B. In addition to the absolute size, the first two trans transactions distinguish themselves high valuation multiples of 12x and 8x on trailing revenues. Company Price Revenue $M Annual Growth Rate Gross Margin NI Margin FCF Margin TTM/Rev OPower 552 149 16% 62% -30% -12% 3.6x Textura 683 92 35% 82% -16% -16% 7.7x Marketo 1795 226 38% 66% -32% -5% 7.9x Demandware 2858 237 43% 71% -17% 5% 12.1x Qlik 2865 631 11% 85% -5% 13% 4.5x Marketo generates more revenues is growing faster and burning less cash than OPower and Textura. Presumably, these three factors and the market opportunity afforded to a horizontal SaaS company led to a greater multiple. That a private equity firm bought Marketo is also a bit unusual, particularly at this revenue multiple. Marketo’s estimated sales efficiency as of Q3 2015 is 0.35, meaning for every dollar of sales and marketing expense, the business generates thirty-five cents of gross profit - which is quite low. Should Vista cut the total annual sales and marketing expense of about $120M by 30%, and presuming revenue retention is not impacted, the business would generate 10% free cash flow. Perhaps that’s the rationale. Salesforce’s acquisition of Demandware adds another cloud to the company’s collection, the eCommerce cloud. The largest SaaS company at $56B in market cap and $7B in annual revenue, Salesforce’s major acquisitions must push the company into massive markets and contribute meaningfully to revenue in the intermediate term. Ecommerce in the US is roughly $350B and growing at 14% annually - a very large market indeed. Demandware’s financial performance supersedes the high water multiple mark of the three other companies because of the business’s greater scale, fastest growth rate, and most positive cash flow margins. It’s the only business on the list that generates cash flow. In 2015, venture backed M&A activity halved, while acquirers continued to amass greater balance sheets. In late 2015, I wrote “In the next 18 months, the converse will be true and cash-rich acquirers who have been looking to bolster their product lines and develop new areas for growth will perceive startups as far more attractive acquisitions at more reasonable prices….This will catalyze a wave of acquisition.” The Qlik acquisition seems to be a classic take-private at a much lower revenue multiple. I suspect we’re only beginning to see the first signs of that wave. And if these more recent transactions are any indication, for those SaaS companies who can show strong financial performance, measured in revenue growth, margins and cash flow, there are premium multiples to be had.

There are two main ways of building a SaaS sales team: top down or bottoms up. Top down SaaS sales organizations start with a VP of Sales who often hires senior account executives. Bottoms up sales teams hire the first account manager and promote from within. Which is better? Let’s create a framework to compare the bookings capacity, the ramp period and the cost for three levels of sales hires. These figures will vary by company and sales team. Entry Level Mid Level Senior OTE, $k 125 175 250 Quota, $k 500 750 1200 Quota:OTE 4.0 4.3 4.8 Ramp Period, months 4 6 9 For this hypothetical startup, an entry-level account executive commands $125,000 in on target earnings (OTE),  a mid-level AE commands $175,000 and a senior-level rep $250,000. Quota span from $500k in bookings to $1.2M. And the ramp time increases from four months to nine months is the function of seniority and deal size.  In addition, the Quota:OTE line indicates that the more senior the account executive, the greater the margin net of commissions to the company. What are the trade-offs between building a team of entry-level account executives versus a team of senior account executives? This next table attempts to quantify that. Level Salary Bookings Opportunity Cost Total Cost Quota Normalization Cost of Failed Hire(s) FTE Equiv. Entry-Level 21 62 83 2.4 200 5.9 Mid-Level 44 187 231 1.6 370 2.1 Senior 94 400 494 494 1 1 Let’s assume that the sales leader knows at the end of the ramp period that the account executive isn’t going to work out, and during the ramp, the account executive closes no bookings. The table above calculates the cost of the organization by adding the salary throughout the ramp time and the opportunity cost of lost bookings, compared to a successful rep. Then, we normalize the cost to $1.2M quota. Finally, we calculate the number of equivalent failed hires. This company can hire about six entry-level sales reps for every one senior account executive failed hire in terms of total financial cost to the organization, and about 2 mid-level reps.  Of course, this calculation does not take into account the recruiting time, management time, impact to culture of a greater turnover rate. Hiring entry-level reps at the beginning of a startup’s life offers several advantages. First, it’s a less expensive way of experimentation to find exactly the right profile of salesperson to fit the organization. Second, entry-level account executives’ quota is less than half the senior account executive and this reduces volatility. If a senior account executive attains 0% quota attainment, it is a $0.9 million annual miss (quota x ramp). But if one of two entry-level account executives miss, it’s a $0.125M miss. The cost of a mistaken hire is much smaller. On the other hand, growing a large sales team with entry level reps is more expensive per booking dollar since each rep books a smaller quota. In addition, larger teams require more management. More junior teams will require greater training. There is a reason why most SaaS startups start with entry-level inside sales reps. It affords the business the most efficient way of experimenting to find the right profile of account executive. These businesses trade slightly more expensive bookings dollars for greater flexibility and predictability. In addition, it’s also rare for a startup to be able to recruit a top VP Sales, who can bring relationships with senior account executives at the outset. Over time, the company grows, many SaaS companies begin to develop teams with varied experience levels.

We each know that focus is the most effective way to work, but hearing the mantra to focus doesn’t help narrow our scope. What’s the best way to focus? Start with the premise that everything is noise and then work to find the exceptionally valuable or important things for each day and for each project. That’s the thesis of a book called Essentialism . Defaulting to the idea that everything as noise simplifies decision-making about time allocation. In many areas of our life, we classify noise unconsciously. Archiving email spam, filtering out irrelevant boarding announcements at airports, and driving by habit. How can we replicate the same idea at work? By asking, is this noise? Is this among my top 3 priorities? Will this effort be exceptionally valuable? I remember walking through an exhibition at the SF Moma that showcased the design work of Dieter Rams. The SK-4 phonograph player above has become a Bauhaus design icon and embodies a mantra Rams learned from his grandfather, “Less but better.” There’s a wonderful design critique and historical reflection on this record player which marked a critical moment in the evolution of Braun. Seeing this kind of focus embodied in a physical object reminds me to seek it in more intangible places like time allocation. “Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things”, said Steve Jobs. “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” said Warren Buffett. Many masters of their professions have articulated the same idea in slightly different ways. Framing everything as noise goes a bit farther though. We ask ourselves each morning, before every email and for each request, is this noise? And that small question demands a bit of activation energy, imposes a bit of friction, and pushes us to remember our priorities. However you say it, I hope this blog post is a reminder of the value of focus.

“There are three different types of channel relationships for SaaS companies,” a seasoned executive told me recently. Which is the right one for your SaaS startup? In a classic reseller relationship, the value-added reseller sells, builds, services and operates a solution to a customer. After signing the deal, the VAR crafts and customize the software to the needs of the customer, invoices the customer and supports the customer. The VAR pays some royalty or license fee back to the vendor. Most of the time, when companies say they sell through the channel, they refer to this type of arrangement. In contrast to the reseller model, the application developer model has one major difference. The vendor bills the customer directly and supports the customer. Salesforce is a great example. Salesforce customers always pay Salesforce directly, even if that customer has paid a services firm to customize Salesforce. The services firm does not resell Salesforce. Rather, the channel can sell an application, Salesforce customization and/or support. The last of the three models is the brokerage channel model. Most akin to the relationship between an insurance agent and an insurance company, this channel relationship lends itself to simpler SaaS products and more transactional sales. The channel partner’s value lies in bundling or packaging a stack of different solutions for a particular customer segment, and potentially some basic account management. A broker channel might develop a software stack for restaurants or for general contractors by selecting the best SaaS point solutions, configuring the integrations and then providing basic support. This classification of channel strategies into a hierarchy helped me demystify a lot of the talk about channel sales and what the channel program might be for different types of SaaS startups. No matter the type of channel program, whether VAR, application developer or software broker, the ambition of channel programs remains the same: partner with other organizations who can acquire new customers. The program types typically do vary by the complexity of the software. The more complex the software, the more bespoke the customer’s requirements, the more expensive the transaction, the greater the likelihood of a traditional VAR relationship. These channel partners may have cornered the market in sandwich shops or chemical producers. Industry knowledge, established relationships and an ability to reshape or reposition a SaaS company’s product as a solution rather than off-the-shelf software with a generic marketing message can be an important go-to-market advantage. When thinking through your SaaS startup’s go-to-market strategy, consider which channel relationship might help your bookings grow faster.

One question founders often ask is which is the right customer size to target? What is the optimal ACV for a SaaS startup? One way of answering this question is to reflect upon the success of previous SaaS companies and analyze how they did it. The chart above plots the total revenue of publicly traded SaaS companies by ACV bucket. Enterprise companies average contract value is greater than $100,000. Mid-market companies span $10,000-$100,000, and SMB companies generate less than $10,000 per year per customer.  These demarcations are not industry-standard, but my own. Surprisingly, the share of revenue across these three buckets is equal.  In addition, the number of companies fitting into each bucket is also equal. So, on average, a SaaS company in any of these three segments generates roughly equivalent revenue. The size of customer does not materially impact the opportunity to generate revenue. Why is this? There are a similar number of employees in small companies, mid-market companies, and enterprise companies. The bar chart above, using data from the U.S. Census in 2013, indicates that 47 million people are employed by enterprise companies, 31 million people work at mid-market companies and 40 million people hold posts at small businesses. So, the theoretical market for product that is sold by the seat is roughly equivalent across these three segments. In addition, many of these SaaS companies straddle buckets. It is not uncommon for a SaaS company to start in the small to medium business segment and push into the mid-market. Or develop a beachhead in the mid-market and drive into enterprise. Last, it’s rare to find a SaaS business with winner take all dynamics across customer sizes. Workday may dominate the enterprise part of the human capital software market, but it has ceded the mid-and small business market to others. The opportunities before software companies are large enough to support several winners.  Unlike the consumer world, network effects that span customer segments are rare. There are many different ways of building a very successful SaaS company and that this analysis further supports that conclusion.  Whether you choose to start a company serving the 5 million small to medium businesses or the 1000 largest companies in America, your revenue opportunity will not meaningfully change. The more important consideration is ensuring that your product, marketing, and go to market strategy aligns with customer base . Note: I have removed Salesforce from this analysis because it is an outlier and also quite difficult to categorize. At the time it was public, Salesforce was a squarely mid-market vendor, but it has evolved to be more of an enterprise vendor. In addition, Salesforce’s revenue is five times the size of the next player. If it were to be included, it would double the midmarket line in blue.

To thrive, venture capital firms must perform three things well: raise capital from limited partners, source companies to invest in, and pick the best opportunities. Historically, each of these three activities has been highly centralized in a small partnership often perched on Sand Hill Road. But new networks are changing this. The latest called DAO attempts to decentralize all three at once. In the last decade, venture firms have experimented with decentralized sourcing. Bounty referral programs including scouts and equity partners, and online common applications . Each represents a different type of effort to scalably uncover new investment opportunities. As for decentralized fundraising, crowdfunded Angellist syndicates deploy more than $150M annually , implying the equivalent of a $450M fund assuming a 3 year investment period. The most recent experiment, DAO , is unique for several reasons. First, it’s funded in Ethereum, a Bitcoin derivative currency. Second, its investor base numbers in the thousands; and they are all anonymous. The third attribute is the most distinct and probably groundbreaking. The investment decision process is decentralized: each anonymous investor votes. Decision-making in venture firm is a dark art. There is no universal mechanism for shepherding a group of people to reach some form of consensus. Some firms vote: majority, minority. Others impart decision making power to each individual. Yet others request input from the subset of the partnership best versed in the subject matter. Most of the time, the decision process is veiled in secrecy. There’s a trope about VC investment: you want to invest in non-consensus companies and be right about their potential. Non-consensus means investing in areas competitors aren’t yet so the valuations are more attractive because there is less capital supply. And correct meaning the company is a huge success. If that’s the case, then the question for all VCs is how to structure a decision-making process that encourages non-consensus decisions? Which turns out to be a very similar conversation among early stage co-founders: which is the best business to start right now? Perhaps it is wisdom of the crowds. DAO is the first I’ve heard of an en masse decision-making effort at a venture firm. The closest may be the collective fundraising efforts on Kickstarter. Will the wisdom of the crowds be a successful mechanism for selecting startups? I’m excited to see. That would certainly turn the venture business on its head.

At Google, we tested everything. User interfaces, advertising targeting models, even hiring practices. One product team tested 41 different shades of blue to ensure maximum click through rate; but the company is now testing black links. That’s one enormous advantage of A/B testing - all the sacred cows must prove their beatitude to maintain their divinity. As Looker founder Lloyd Tabb explained to me, it doesn’t work for early stage SaaS companies. There’s a key ingredient to AB testing that most SaaS companies don’t have, something that Google profited tremendously from. Huge amounts of user traffic. The image above is a screenshot from A/B Testing marketshare leader Optimizely. To detect a 20% change in a target metric with 90% confidence if it happens to 3% of visitors requires 12,000 visitors per test. In other words, the AB test require 24,000 visitors to test two variations. Most early stage SaaS companies simply don’t have enough volume to achieve statistical significance in few days or even weeks. For many early-stage software companies achieving this kind of scale requires months or even quarters, an eternity in increasingly competitive markets. The answer is not to reduce the confidence level or simply to run the test on a smaller scale and pick the one that seems to be performing better. Deciding that way is equally as arbitrary as deciding with no data at all. What recourse do early-stage SaaS companies have to determine the best pricing strategy, product design, or landing page?  It’s not numerical data. Rather, it’s qualitative data:  interviewing users about the whys underpinning their points of view on price, reviewing the video of people  exploring the product, and opinions about design. It’s the qualitative data, the acumen of an brilliant designer, the insight of a skilled product manager, the empathy of a master marketer. At small-scale, intuition and research trumps statistical analysis. It’s not that statistical analysis doesn’t have its place. At scale, running large multivariate tests enables businesses like Google and others to consistently seek out a marginal 1 to 5% gain in product usage, performance, and revenue. But the time frame required for statistical analysis at small-scale is not viable for early stage and even mid-stage SaaS startups.

The highest correlated factor to post-money valuations for Series A SaaS companies isn’t revenue or revenue growth, but negative churn. Revenue growth correlates to post-money with a 0.18 R^2. Revenue correlates at 0.3 R^2. Negative churn, or account expansion, correlates at 0.54 R^2. Initially, I found that result astounding, because all of the public market research and valuation work focuses instead of multiples of revenue. But the more I reflected on it, the more logical it is, especially for an early stage company. Here’s why: Account expansion demonstrates initial product market fit. Customers are buying more of the product they trialled. Account expansion meaningfully reduces the amount of a capital a startup needs to grow. Customer success reduces customer acquisition costs by fueling word of mouth. Customer success increases or at least stabilizes the market size, because a business isn’t burning through customers . At some point in the not too distant future, new bookings from customer success will exceed new bookings from the sales team. If a product satisfies a small group of customers so well that they continue to increase their spend, investors won’t be challenged to believe that there lies a large market of similar customers who will behave identically. The data underscores why building a great product is the first order of business for a startup and why developing great customer success should be the second order of business. Many founders do this instinctively, and develop a cadre of reference customers. If you needed one more reason to develop a product, pricing plan and go-to-market with negative net churn, here it is. It’s the best predictor of your valuation when you raise your Series A.

Half of innovation is invention . Creating an elegant, disruptive, and new experience is one of the greatest attractions of founding a company. A product that can change the way people view the world and interact with it – who doesn’t want to build that?  Most start ups have no problem focusing time and attention on iterating, improving and perfecting product. It’s in the other half of the innovation equation that startups often underinvest: go to market. If you build a disruptive product in the woods and no one is around, does anyone buy it? Simply copying a competitor’s go to market strategy – positioning, pricing, sales motions, and distribution channels - often just is not enough to create a truly disruptive business. Nor does the strategy do justice to the amount of time and effort invested in developing the product. Great products merit innovative go to market. Go to market means aligning product, engineering, sales, marketing and customer success. The company’s message and position in the market has to highlight and emphasize the product’s unique advantages. The sales people have to pitch those advantages. The pricing of the product has to reflect the pricing strategy : Maximization, Penetration, or Skimming. Freemium products like Expensify disrupt bottoms up. They leverage the substantially better user experiences they have built to change the cost of customer acquisition economics. Expensify’s positioning is iconoclastic (Expense Reports that Don’t Suck). Expensify’s pricing enables users to try and use the product, penetrating potential customers with advocates over time. Customer support and sales are structured to maximize penetration and engender tremendous account growth rather than immediate revenue maximization. Expensify distributes in app stores - the places end users are most likely to seek a new product. It’s all consistent. The pricing, the product, the brand, the sales and support, the distribution all reinforce the strengths of the company. Go to market isn’t a throwaway slide on a deck. It’s the way a business educates the world about the amazing products they have built and convinces users that it’s worth switching. Without developing that persuasive skill, the company’s invention will remain just that - an invention. But, when a company invests just as much effort into perfecting go to market strategy as they do it to the product, they can truly disrupt. Is your go to market aligned? Are you investing as much effort into maximizing your startup’s persuasive skills as inventing?

Just how real is the sudden importance and profitability for SaaS companies? The median publicly traded SaaS company has improved net margin from -25% to -8.8% in less than two years, after a nearly four-year trend of negative growth in net margin. The initial spike in 2014 occurs two quarters after the first SaaS correction and the second occurs in late 2015. Examining the trend by quartile, we see that the 75th percentile companies operate at breakeven. Companies in the 25th percentile and 50th percentile have been pushing profitability further and further into the red, only to reverse the trend beginning in 2014 after the first SaaS correction. So, it is the companies whose profitability has historically been worst who have been changing the way they operate. How have these changes impacted growth and cash flows? Surprisingly, very little. In the chart above, revenue growth is marked in orange and cash flow from operations in red. The median across this basket of stocks remains constant over the same time frame. This indicates lower quartile net margin companies are  changing the way they operate their businesses. The data suggests that these businesses are likely restructuring their contracts to defer less revenue, but the issued merits more research. Regardless of how these businesses are achieving these changes, the data is clear: for these companies, investors demand a clear path to profitability. How much does it matter for early-stage SaaS companies? After all, these businesses don’t have to report to public market investors. For early-stage businesses, the ability to become profitable on the company’s current cash provides founders leverage in fundraising conversations. As we have seen in the past, series A companies are typically not valued on revenue multiples, so profitability that stage is not that material. But the later stages the company becomes, the more likely investors are to evaluate similarly to public businesses. And then the path profitability influences valuation more.

The notion of channel sales in SaaS companies is becoming more common than in has been in the last few years, and for some businesses like Intacct, channel partnerships drive more than 50% of sales . Channels used to be about software customization, delivery and support. Most SaaS has little customization, manages all the delivery and are better suited to handling the support. Plus, value-added resellers charged buyers on a per-project basis which doesn’t align neatly with the recurring subscription intrinsic to SaaS. So there hasn’t been a great fit. But the reasons underpinning channel sales for license software companies are theoretically as compelling for SaaS companies. Channel sales (when another company sells, implements and/or supports your startup’s product) can be a big strategic asset for three financial reasons. First, channels can generate more new business and increase revenue without the need to hire more sales people. By leveraging another company’s sales team, your startup’s cost to book a marginal revenue dollar decline, as revenue scales and net margin increases. Second, the channel partner can support the product, reducing the cost of goods sold for the SaaS company. This increases the SaaS company’s gross margin. Third, channels diversify customer acquisition for a SaaS company insulating the bookings number from the episodic underperformance typical of a single channel go-to-market. More predictable growth commands greater multiples in the fundraising market. Additionally, channels can enable companies to serve new geographies without having to establish presences there. Developing reseller channels do require building a dedicated internal team to cultivate relationships, educate resellers, align internal and external incentives, and ensure success. Plus, there can be some complexities in sales compensation. How does a SaaS company compensate a sales person if they are competing with a channel partner to close the same account? Eg, many businesses pay commission twice: to the channel and the AE. As the SaaS ecosystem matures, and SaaS revenues increases from 14% of overall software dollars to 20, 30 and 40%, the reseller and channel market must evolve along with it. And SaaS startups that can take advantage of these distribution opportunities successfully will develop a sustainable competitive advantage for themselves.

In the past week, Oracle acquired two vertical SaaS companies. OPower is an Arlington Virginia based company that employs approximately 600 people. The company analyzes utility consumption patterns and helps homeowners reduce their energy consumption. Textura provides collaboration tools for the construction industry and is based in Illinois. Oracle paid $663 million, net of cash for Textura and $532 million for OPower. These two acquisitions form a notable moment in time for the evolution of the vertical software industry. They establish benchmarks for valuing these companies at M&A. Both of these businesses had been public for at least 12 months, so the valuations aren’t coming out of the blue. Below, the table shows a comparison of the key operating metrics of each business and the ultimate acquisition multiple. Company Revenue $M Annual Growth Rate Gross Margin Operating Margin M&A Trailing Revenue Multiple OPower 149 15.5% 62.3% -30.2% 3.6x Textura 92 35% 82.4% -16.3% 7.7x OPower is a larger business at $149 million in revenue, but it is growing at 16% annually. The company has established a de facto monopoly in selling software analytics to utilities, leading to a slower than typical growth rate. In addition, OPower’s gross margin at 62% is lower than the median SaaS company of 71%. The combination of these two factors likely resulted in the 3.6x trailing 12 month revenue multiple. Though a smaller business at $92M, Textura is growing at twice the rate of OPower and at 20 points higher gross margins.  In addition, Textura’s operating margin (aka net income margin)substantially better at -16% compared to -30% for OPower. Textura commanded a 7.7x trailing 12 month revenue multiple. There are other dynamics at play that are invisible to this analysis, including whether or not there were multiple buyers and an auction for one acquisition versus another. Nevertheless, the Oracle acquisitions demonstrate the appetite of larger software companies for additional products to sell through their channels. These are not the first vertical software acquisitions, nor will they be the last. But I do believe that they are the harbingers of a very active software acquisition market we’ll see in 2016 and 2017. Large software incumbents must bolster their product portfolios so their sales teams have new products to sell. The market has spoken and with at least 14% of software revenue delivered as a service , these incumbents must respond with best in class products. Most of the time companies like Oracle acquire these businesses rather than build the products themselves. Plus, now is a great time to be buying. Software multiples in the public markets have compressed, falling by 57% at their nadir . Meanwhile,  many of these businesses have substantial cash on their balance sheets. Though much of the capital does lie outside the US, a substantial chunk can be used for US acquisitions. 2016 will be a very fruitful year for acquisitions particularly in the software world and it is just getting started.

It is an election year. The Federal Reserve has changed its interest rate hike plan. Venture financing has slowed by upwards of 15% in the first quarter. Q1 GDP growth fell to 0.5% from 1.4% in Q4. How much have all these factors impacted SaaS companies? Are buyers purchasing less software? Each quarter, publicly traded companies release two key figures: revenue per share and earnings-per-share. Wall Street analysts forecast these figures based upon company plans and their own research. The difference between the median Wall Street estimate and the actual figure provided by the company is called revenue/earnings surprise. If buyers suddenly decided no longer to spend, then, many public companies would report lower revenue per share and lower earnings-per-share - negative surprise. The chart above depicts revenue surprise for a basket of publicly traded consumer and software companies. Consumer companies are red and software companies are blue. Only four companies out of this basket reported negative revenue surprise. Most companies exceeded their median estimates. New Relic, RingCentral, Splunk and LinkedIn all reported greater than 4% better revenue than forecasted by Wall Street analysts. On the whole, a super-majority of these businesses  exceeded their forecasts. This means their businesses are relatively predictable, and buyers are continuing to purchase software according to internal models. Earnings-per-share surprise is a bit more variable then revenue per share surprise. Stock-based compensation, unexpected operating costs, and other factors can impact the earnings-per-share surprise, more often negatively and positively. Here, the data is more balanced, with just a slight majority of companies reporting positive earnings per share surprise. Though externalities perturb the US and global economies from externalities, these companies continue to demonstrate an ability to predict their businesses effectively, indicating that at least through Q1, the selling and buying environment for software has not changed materially.

In ServiceNow’s Q1 Investor presentation are the first semblances of SaaS metrics in public company reporting. If you sift through the 40+ public SaaS businesses, you won’t find mention of annual recurring revenue, churn, account expansion, or cash collection cycles in most of them - even though these are the the metrics the management teams employ to evaluate and steer their businesses. ServiceNow hasn’t published metrics on ARR or payback period, which for most public investors are still esoteric terms. Instead they frame their growth in three parts, familiar to SaaS operators everywhere: land + expand + retain. The image above shows Q1’s triptych of new customer additions, expansion as a percentage of new quarterly bookings and quarterly dollar revenue retention. A second slide reveals the contract length for each element of the growth trio. 32 month average contract duration for new business; 23-26 month for upsell and renewal. At a $1B in annual revenue and nearly $12B market cap, ServiceNow is the third most valuable public SaaS company after Salesforce and Workday. And with an average contract value of roughly $300k, ServiceNow falls squarely into the enterprise segment of SaaS businesses. ServiceNow’s effort to communicate to investors how the management team measures and guides the business in straightforward terms, rather than industry jargon, is an important step in educating the market on the differences between subscription software companies and traditional licensed software businesses. In addition,  SaaS startups might also benefit from segmenting their reports in this way, particularly as the business scales and the fraction of revenue from renewals and expansion outpace new bookings .

As the overall venture market environment evolves in 2016, so too does the SaaS and Software segment. The number of Series A, B, C, and D investments in software companies stabilized at roughly 170 per quarter from mid-2013 through mid-2015, before falling 17% in Q4 2015 to a two year low. In Q1 2016, SaaS rounds increased a modest 10%. The SaaS fundraising has slowed in parallel to the rest of the market. But early 2016 pace still exceeds the best quarters of 2010-2012. In dollar terms, Q1 notched the greatest amount invested yet. The aggregate amount raised does seem to be stabilizing around $2.8B per quarter, and suffers from substantial volatility of about $1B. Many startups who raised their early rounds in the 2012-2014 time frame are growing quickly and raising substantially larger follow-ons. Let’s break down the data by series. Series A volumes have been declining steadily since their Q1 2014 highs. Over the past eight quarters, volumes have fallen by 25%. Series Bs and Series Cs are flat. Series Ds are down, but trivial in number. Though Series A rounds have slid, the median round size is at near five-year highs of $6M; similar for Series Bs at $13.6M. This behavior echoes the concentration of dollars we see in the seed market. Series C rounds spiked to greater than $30M after a quarter at $15M - the variance between the two figures challenges our ability to draw an inference. Median Series D round sizes though are stable. In aggregate dollar terms, Series As are flat; Series Bs have fallen by 50% from their highs; Series Cs spiked, reaching five year highs and Series Ds are stable. The SaaS fundraising market is remarkably similar to the overall venture market. Investors are concentrating dollars in fewer early-stage bets. Series B rounds seem to be the hardest to raise as both the count and dollars steadily erode. There’s something funny going on in the series C market, because it’s the only one that is growing at any meaningful rate. Perhaps this is the return of the classic late stage venture investor, suddenly able to invest in businesses at reasonable valuations as hedge funds, mutual funds and family offices return to bread-and-butter investing and leave the venture market. In summary, SaaS startups today still enjoy one of the best fundraising markets of the last five years. The complexion of the market certainly has changed a bit, but set in historical context, it’s still a great time to be a SaaS founder.

It’s hard to read Boys in the Boat before I sleep. The stories of the 8 rowers awaiting the coxswain’s call at the starting line of a boat race remind me of the races I competed in with so many wonderful friends and oarsmen. Imagining those races - and in particular, placing second at nationals, the adrenaline surges and my heartbeat accelerates, resurfacing all those memories and moments. Daniel James Brown, the author of the book, captures the most important element of rowing in a conversation between George Pocock, the legendary racing shell craftsman, and Joe Rantz, one of the members of the gold-medal crew, early in Joe’s rowing career. They chatted one evening after practice in the loft above the boathouse where Pockock built his iconic racing shells. [Pocock] suggested that Joe think of a well rowed race as a symphony and himself is just one player in the orchestra. If one fellow in the orchestra was playing out of tune, the whole piece would be ruined. That’s the way was with rowing. What mattered more than how how ard a man rowed was how well everything he did in the boat harmonized with the other fellows were doing…“If you don’t like some fellow in the boat, Joe, you have to learn to like him. It has to matter to you whether he wins the race, not just whether you do.” To win a seat in the varsity crew means competing against every other person vying for that seat. Once you’ve won your place, it’s time to focus on the race. But to win a race requires a different effort.  Everyone must to pull together, in harmony - and it must matter whether the others on the team win too. That’s a critical transition that’s common in many team sports and in business. Caring about the success of teammates is the essence of teamwork; it’s the soul of exceptional teams.

Pricing. Is there any word that confers some whisper of dark arts than pricing? Or any question that instills less confidence than, “How did you derive your pricing strategy?” Many times, startups replicate and tune competitors’ pricing strategies. If everyone else prices per seat, then so should we… Is this the right thought process? Madhavan Ramanujam is a pricing expert. A partner at Simon-Kucher partners, the pre-eminent pricing consultancy, he argues in Monetizing Innovation that there are only three pricing strategies startups should pursue: Maximization, Penetration and Skimming. They prioritize revenue growth, market share and profit maximization differently. Maximization (Revenue Growth) - maximize revenue growth in the short term. Startups should pursue maximization when there are no clear differences in customer segments’ willingness to pay, and when the optimal short term and long term prices are equal. Many mid-market software companies price with the goal of revenue maximization, negotiating for the highest possible price in each sale. Penetration (Market Share) - price the product at a low price to win dominant market share. A bottoms-up strategy lends itself to penetration pricing. Price low to minimize adoption friction, grow quickly, and then move up-market after developing broad adoption. Penetration pricing leads to land-and-expand sales tactics. Expensify, Netsuite, New Relic, Slack follow this model. Penetration prioritizes market share. Skimming (Profit Maximization) - start with a high price and systematically broaden the product offering to address more of the customer base at lower prices. Skimming is widespread in consumer hardware. Apple sells the latest iPhones at the highest prices, and repackages older models at lower prices to address different customer segments. As Madhavan tells it, Steve Jobs was both a product genius and pricing genius. By pairing the two skills, he led Apple to record-breaking profits quarter after quarter. Skimming is less common in the software world because few startups develop a product at launch that will be accepted by the most sophisticated customers (and those willing to pay prices that generate the greatest margin). There are exceptions: Oracle’s database, Tanium’s security product, Workday’s human capital management software. Startup’s pricing strategies should be explicit. They should decide which strategy to pursue, and align sales, marketing, product and engineering efforts along those lines. Madhavan recommends polling your executive team to prioritize revenue growth, volume growth, profit generation, and market share to ensure the company’s pricing strategy is consistent with the goals of the team.

About 15 years since the creation of the first SaaS companies, public SaaS companies account for 14% of total software revenues generated by public companies, a figure growing at about 17% per year. Over the last ten years, the total amount of revenue generated by software companies has tripled from $53B to $169B, meaning SaaS companies are both taking share and growing the market. The growth rate of SaaS revenues follows a geometric growth curve ramping from $1.3B in 2005 to $24B in 2015. However, this revenue growth isn’t a consistent basket. It includes Concur’s revenue from IPO to 2014, when SAP bought Concur. 2015 figures in this chart don’t include Concur’s revenue data, nor from any other take privates, or the SaaS businesses of traditional software companies like Oracle or SAP. In addition, this analysis excludes all private SaaS company revenue, both venture backed and bootstrapped companies. So the analysis actually underestimates the fraction of SaaS revenue today. Perhaps SaaS products generated 20-25% of all software revenues, an astoundingly high figure. Examining the top 10 contributors to SaaS revenue, we notice a power law. CRM generates the lion’s share, followed by LinkedIn, Workday, ServiceNow and AthenaHealth. There’s no doubt SaaS has transformed and grown the software industry. We’re likely entering the middle era of SaaS. We have many platform companies built, significant market share shifting, but still quite a bit of opportunity and revenue to seize.

Starting in late 2015 through the first quarter of 2016, founders have shifted their seed fundraising strategies toward a single investor. Seeds led by a single investor have increased by 50% in these trailing six months. How much of this trend is due to greater participation of venture capitalists investing in the seed market? The chart above plots the number of seeds rounds by year. Rounds with VC participation are marked in blue, and those without VCs in red. Both types of rounds have increased by about 5x since 2010. Rounds without VC participation seem to be roughly twice as frequent as those with venture funds. This pattern hasn’t changed in the last five years. If we examine the data as a percentage of rounds, we see that the share of rounds with VC participation has remained astoundingly identical over this period at 25%. So the data indicates venture capitalists are equally active in the seed market today as a share of total rounds as they have been in the past. However, seed rounds with and without VC participation differ in the round size. The median seed round with VCs has increased from a median of $800k in 2010 to $2.1M in 2016 Q1. Non-VC seed rounds have swelled with a similar growth rate, but remain about 1/3 the size at $750k. The withdrawal from the seed market in number of rounds seems to be broad-based, in that both traditional seed investors and venture capitalists, are investing less frequently. But when they do invest, they concentrate their dollars. Seeds with VCs are growing in size at an amazing rate, and if the trend continues should exceed the $3M mark later this year. At this point, the median seed round could then be called a Series A again. Another flip of Jacob’s fundraising ladder.

Party rounds symbolized the heyday of the startup seed market just a last year. Called parties because of the number of investors who collaboratively financed seed rounds of startups, the lists became almost comically long as seed sizes ballooned and investor syndicates swelled with them. Recently, I have heard from founders that they are less interested in party rounds, but does the data support the case? The chart above plots the percentage of seed investments for US startups by the number of investors in their seed round. I have bucketed the data by investor count: one investor in red, two investors in green, three to five investors in blue, and six-plus investors in orange. The fraction of seed rounds with one investor has eroded its 2012 high of 35% to 28%. The share of seeds with two investors has declined from the 2010 high of 26% to 20%. Meanwhile, the share of seed rounds with three or more investors has increased by 10%. Party rounds are becoming increasingly common in number than they have been in the last five years. However, dollar trends contradict round count trends. Single investor seed rounds’ share of dollars invested have spiked from 19% to just under 30% of dollars, taking share from rounds with 3-6 investors. This pattern is consistent with a previous analysis that showed a decline in seed round counts, but a substantial increase in round sizes. Some investors have changed their strategy preferring to claim the entirety of the round, rather than hosting a party. I suspect this trend is buoyed by a change in venture firms’ seed strategy. Three or four years ago, VCs were investing broadly and sparsely. Today, seed investment by venture capitalists seems more concentrated, though further analysis is required to substantiate that hypothesis. Seeds with 2-5 investors have ceded their share to the single investor. But the share of dollars for seed rounds with 6+ investors has remained steady. If you like to party, bring a big crew… The seed market is in flux, and there are forces moving in opposition. The total number of seeds has fallen, round sizes have increased substantially. There are more party rounds, but those rounds tend to be smaller. Bigger seed rounds have one investor supplying the capital, likely a manifestation of new seed strategies by bigger funds.

Last week, Facebook launched the messenger chatbot platform, which like Slack, Telegram and others, presents a big market opportunity for startups to innovate. In addition, the companies and products that determine how to most efficiently distribute their product on these new platforms will benefit from user curiosity and less competition, both of which result in lower cost-of-customer acquisition. These are the five questions I’m wondering about in this new world: How much infrastructure will the platforms offer on top of their platforms? Aside from the APIs to push and pull data, will the platforms offer NLP, sentiment analysis, predictive response scoring to help application developers build better experiences? In exchange for distribution, access to the platform and potentially some of the services above, how will the platforms tax applications? Will a 30% transaction tax exist as on iOS? When we type queries into Google, we write in a different language dialect than when we chat or write email? Will we change our language to suit these bots, particularly as artificial intelligence begins to respond to an increasing number of our inbound messages? how will use cases of chat bots evolve over time? facebook’s initial launch partners’ bots fall into four categories: alerts, search/input, support and bookings. alerts are notifications of news, events, account updates. search means searching for movie showtimes or finding a customer record; input could be updating a crm record. support is talking to a vendor’s support team by chat. bookings bots enable customers to buy products or services through chat. alerts and support are the most popular today, as the chart above shows, because they are the most obvious applications. will social bots microsoft’s like xiaovoice and tay in some form or another take off? will bots be products in and of themselves, or will they be one of many interfaces to a standalone web app? What will the primary methods of distribution be? Will paid bot distribution manifest itself somehow and replicate some of the behaviors of the pay-per-install market of the mobile world? Can bots be viral? New user experience and distribution platforms come around perhaps once every ten years. Bots have the opportunity to create a discontinuity in the market. It’s going to be enthralling to see all the innovation that founders and startups will bring to this market.

“All new ideas are combinations of old ideas, but not all idea combinations are created equal,” wrote Frans Johannsen . Mick Pearson designed the Eastgate office building in Harare, Zimbabwe based on techniques he observed termites employ to stabilize the internal temperature of their nests. Remarkably, the Eastgate maintains an ambient temperature between 73-78°F despite variances in external temperatures from 58° to 88°. Johannsen argues in his book that most innovation comes at the intersection of fields, and Pearson is just one example. In 2005, an economist named Benjamin Jones published a paper called The Burden of Knowledge and the ‘Death of the Renaissance Man’: Is Innovation Getting Harder? . At one point in time, they were a handful of people who knew nearly everything there was to know about the world, he argues. Today, that notion is laughable. Even PhDs who spend 5 to 6 years researching a particular field like machine learning specialize in a niche and will not be experts in just the field of ML. Jones argues to innovate today given this explosion of information, we have to assemble teams whose expertise complements the other team members, so that we can all work on the intersection of our respective knowledge. This idea working at the intersection applies both at the limit human knowledge In fields like pure math and theoretical physics, and the everyday SaaS company. How much does the customer success team know about customer pain points that the sales team does not? The sales team may be starkly familiar with the nuances of customer objections, but the marketing team hasn’t developed the case studies to address them. The sales leader may seek to experiment with a new sales promotion he believes will double sales, but without consulting the finance team, the company may not understand the cash implications of the sale. In a company, innovating at the intersection often means sharing observations and data to support hypothesis. Like human knowledge, data within organizations seems to be splintering geometrically , with new databases and new data sources sprouting all over the organization. Each data set a new source of insight, like an individual PhD working on a niche. Innovating at the intersection within businesses means sharing data. One of the most important recent advances for startups is the combination of Segment Sources and Looker Blocks . The combination of these two technologies enables companies to analyze funnels from end to end: from marketing campaign to landing page to contract signing to customer success interaction to lifecycle marketing campaign to upsell. Innovating at the intersection can happen at many different levels, at the most abstract academic planes and also the most quotidian meetings. Regardless of where it happens, innovating at the intersection means collaborating among people with different shared experiences and knowledge to reorder ideas to unlock something new.

Daniel Kahneman wrote about his experiences with the inside/outside bias. Kahneman, a team of graduate students, and the Dean of the Hebrew University School of Education collaborated on curriculum for judgment and decision-making for high schools. At one point, Kahneman surveyed his team to estimate the amount of time remaining to complete project. The group’s opinion ranged from 18 to 30 months. The Dean, who had developed several textbooks in the past, initially concurred with the group. But Kahneman prodded him on the timelines for his other projects, at which point the Dean reflected and responded previous teams completed these projects in 7 to 10 years’ time. Thinking as an insider, a member of the team, the Dean dramatically underestimated the scope of the project remaining, despite his expertise. Ultimately, the book was completed eight years later. Inside/outside bias. An entrepreneur told me about this bias, and I reacted by saying more or less all founders ignore it. There are two relevant refrains in Startupland. “This time it’s different. We have a different approach, unique team, and the market has changed,” and, “If I had known what it would have taken to succeed in this business, I wouldn’t have started it.” Those bookend the startup journey from founding to exit, and articulate inside/outside bias from each. Perhaps, there’s a good reason to ignore it. The most disruptive companies are the ones which believe they can succeed where others have failed. The “last” search company was Google. Instagram and Snapchat thrived in a social media environment seemingly asphyxiated by Facebook’s dominance. Salesforce challenged the Oracle and Siebel’s hegemony in CRM. I could keep listing examples. Plus the feeling of us vs. the world is a powerful unifying cry, particularly at the outset of a business, when three to four people dream of changing the world from a sofa and kitchen table. It will be different. We will succeed where others haven’t. We will disrupt. Inside/outside bias is the thick skin needed to survive the doubts, fears and insecurities that starting a business inevitably evokes in the team. To head blindly into a new sector with clear minds, full hearts, and bravado-fueled-bias may not be enough. In Kahneman’s case, the team may have been exceptionally bright - Kahneman is a Nobel laureate - but nothing in the team’s approach positioned them to author a textbook on a massively accelerated timeframe. But the companies above and many other successes did benefit from a discontinuity: Google developed novel server technology and a better algorithm; Instagram leveraged the explosive usage of mobile phone; Snapchat seized an unmet desire for the privacy rendered by ephemerality; Salesforce sold CRM as a service. Inside/outside bias may be an essential ingredient to starting a company, a swagger, brio, gusto necessary to weather the vicissitudes of startup-life. Better yet is to substantiate that bias with a reason why things are different this time, why the team can succeed where others have failed, why the market has changed. Something the company believes that no one else does. A secret to inspire that confidence and defend the bias.

About one third of US startups that raise a seed round raise a Series A.  The larger the seed investment, the greater the odds the company successfully raises the next round. A $500,000 seed round results in a series A 20% of the time, while $1.5M seed increases the chances to 30%, an increase of half. larger seed rounds enable early-stage companies to experiment more, hire more aggressively, recover from mistakes better and attain more of the milestones necessary to raise a series A. There is a decline at the $4 million mark, which I suspect has more to do with nomenclature than it does with data. I suspect the majority of the companies who raise $4 million or more seed rounds raise rounds that are the equivalent of series Bs, rather than As. However, a larger seed round doesn’t guarantee a larger series A. In fact the sizes of seed rounds are only somewhat correlated with the sizes of series As. The R^2 is 0.44. Sometimes early-stage companies can prove the hypothesis that underpins their business, and sometimes the product market fit simply isn’t there. Notably, this correlation is consistent over the last five years, bring between 0.2 and 0.44, with the exception of 2014 which saw a 0.72 correlation. This blip marks another indicator of the blind-bull market we lived through just two years ago. The chart above is a cumulative distribution function chart that shows the percentage of companies raising series A over time. At ten months,  25% of seed companies that will eventually raise a series A have raised. At 12 months, that number spikes to 50%, and at two years, more than 80% will have raised their A. There we have certainly seen a dramatic shift of the seed market in the last two quarters, the data above suggests that the amount of money to raise to maximize the odds of success hasn’t changed over those five years, nor is the timing. Startups raising seed rounds of greater than $1 million and pursuing their series A 10 months to 24 months after the initial investment seemed greater success in the fund-raising market. Of course, success in the fund-raising market is a lagging indicator. Because a company raises exactly million dollars and goes out to raise a series A 12 months later doesn’t imply the business will successfully raise more capital. Milestone attainment is paramount and primary. The business needs to be on its way to achieving its vision to raise. No optimization of fundraising strategy or timing can obviate that requirement, especially not in today’s environment. Source: Crunchbase

The Future of Machine Intelligence is a free collection of 10 interviews machine learning experts filed by David Beyer. The interviews explain exactly where we are with the state-of-the-art, the challenges to advanced machine learning, and some of the applications. In the last interview, Oriol Vinyals, a research scientist at Google, describes sequence-to-sequence machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence that has been used to create descriptions of images, and could be used to summarize a 20 minute video into four descriptive sentences. In fact, this summarization ability isn’t limited to graphical content: Perhaps five years is pushing it, but the notion of a machine reading
a book for comprehension is not too distant. In a similar vein, we
should expect to see machines that answer questions by learning
from the data, rather than following given rule sets. Right now, if I
ask you a question, you go to Google and begin your search; after
some number of iterations, you might return with an answer. Just
like you, machines should be able to run down an answer in
response to some question. What do we do with computers that understood books and movies and images, and summarize them well? The amount of content we are generating is increasing exponentially. Perhaps this type of intelligence will help us make sense of it all. In Chapter 5, Benjamin Recht an associate professor computer science and statistics at Berkeley compares and contrasts control theory with machine learning. Control theory was my favorite subject in school. One of my final exams in graduate school was to develop an algorithm to automatically pilot a Boeing 747 by using information from the sensors on the wings and nose of the plane about turbulence and moving the ailerons and rudder in response. We would model real world objects as a collection of spring-mass dampers , and unlike traditional machine learning, we were most concerned with developing robust models that would avoid plane crashes. As the world of machine learning moves further and further into the real world, with self driving cars and drone collision avoidance systems, Recht points out the importance of blending control theory and machine learning techniques techniques to develop the right types of artificial intelligence for these applications. The Future of Machine Intelligence is a 90 page breeze of a read that conveys the breadth of applications of machine learning and the barriers to greater adoption across many disciplines.

Over the last six years, seed rounds have grown in size by 12% annually. Series As have grown by 14%, series Bs by 9%, series Cs by 14% and series Ds by 11%. In that same timeframe, the median series A and series C has doubled. Median seed rounds have more than tripled in size. This tripling of seed round sizes is a recent phenomenon, taking place in the first quarter of 2016. In 2015, seed rounds grew 44%, but in the four years before that, they remained relatively constant at about $400,000 median. The box plots above show the distribution of rounds. The white line in the middle of the box is the median. The upper end of the box is the 75th percentile, the lower end of the box is the 25th percentile and the whiskers above and below the boxes indicate the range of round sizes. Later stage rounds have benefited from a secular increase over the last six years. The median series A has grown from $3.3 million to $6 million. Series Bs from $8 million to $13.5 million, series Cs from $12 million to $27 million, and Series Ds from $13.7 million to $25.5 million. All of these increases are statistically significant with p values less than 0.01 over the six year time horizon. So what does this imply for founders? The seed market is a tale of two cities. The number of rounds in 2016 has declined by 50% compared to last year , but the companies that do raise capital collect more than twice as much as last year. The data suggests the market is concentrating dollars in seed stage companies, preferring to invest in fewer of them, but allocate greater resources to them. Later rounds seem to be continuing their consistent growth, likely driven by the near historic amounts of capital raised by venture capitalist in the last two years. As round sizes increase, the table stakes to enter a particular sector increases, and new entrants must follow suit. In addition, analysis of software companies indicates the milestones required to raise series As have increased in parallel with round sizes. For one subset of companies, the average monthly recurring revenue at the series A increased from about $50,000 to $163,000 (slide 10), although there is a substantial contingent of 27% that raise with no revenue. Overall, the seed market is the first segment of the venture capital market that seems to be undergoing a substantial correction. Pricing of seed round has declined substantially from last year, round volumes have been cut in half, but there is a concentration of capital in the companies that do raise. The rest of the market seems to be doing business as usual.

Q1 venture capital investment remains steady relative to Q4 2015 at about $15 billion, but down from the near records attained in 2015. Over the last five years, seven of the twenty-nine quarters have reached or exceeded the $15 billion mark, all of them within the last two years. So, on a historical basis, venture capitalists are still investing at rates substantially above average. 2016 is off to a slower start than 2015. In Q1 2015, venture capitalists invested $17.5 billion compared to $14.6 billion in Q1 2016, a decline of about 17%. Nevertheless, Q1 2016 activity exceeded Q1 2014. Let’s break this aggregate figure down by round size. Rather than analyzing the trends by named rounds (Seed, Series A, Series B) whose definitions of fluctuated over the last six years, this analysis cuts the data using round sizes. Seed is defined as rounds smaller than $3 million, series As are less than $10 million but larger than $3 million, series Bs are between $10 million and $25 million and so on. Seed investments in dollar terms have fallen by about 30% in the last two quarters. Series As are flat at roughly $2 billion invested per quarter. Series Bs have fallen by 25% from $4 billion-$3 billion over the last few quarters. Surprisingly, series Cs our steady at $4 billion. Rounds above $100 million have fallen by about a third, meanwhile rounds greater than $100 million but less than $1 billion have fallen by 66%. If we examine the number of rounds, the trends are similar. The volume of seed rounds has fallen from about 1250 per quarter to just about 550. Series As remain constant at 400. Series Bs have fallen from their 2015 highs. Meanwhile, greater than $100 million rounds have fallen from about 24 per quarter to fewer than 7. The contraction in the later stage market is not a surprise. Bloomberg has reported hedge funds and other nontraditional startup investors have been retrenching from the market , with the number of firms investing in US venture backed technology rounds shrinking by 66% to 11. With these nontraditional investors contributing close to 25% of dollars, we should expect that the total amount of venture capital investment to decline by summer between 15 to 20% this year, if the trend continues. However, that contraction effects only a small number of startups. More notable is the decline in the seed market, in both dollar terms and round counts, because this change in the market affects substantially more startups.  The first quarter in 2016 has been the hardest quarter to raise a seed round in the past five years. This retrenchment in the seed market may be caused by several factors. First, seed valuations had been increasing to historically elevated levels ($12-20M+ caps) over the same period. With the recent public market correction in technology stocks, higher valuations present greater challenges for raising attractive follow-on rounds. In response, seed investors have changed their pricing thresholds, and founders may have decided to delay their seed round finding those terms less attractive, contributing to this decline. Also, later stage venture capital firms seem to be investing in seed rounds with less frequency than they have been in the past two years - an interesting trend analyze for a future post. Those startups raising series As should take heart. The series A market is steadfast, unchanged over the last two years in both number of rounds and dollars invested. Series Bs’ frequency has declined and from my point of view, there has been far more price compression in those rounds then in Series As, even though median round sizes have remained relatively constant for both. Pockets of the fund-raising environment are in flux. Seed rounds are in decline, series Bs and later rounds seem to be more affected. On the other hand, Series A investors are unperturbed.

There’s a new class of company that wield data to create long-term competitive advantage. TheRealReal uses this morning’s sales data to inform this afternoon’s marketing campaigns. Hubspot motivates its sales teams not just with a target quota, but a blend of key sales metrics that reflect the strategic priorities of the company. Zendesk’s data team educates and trains its employees to use data in meetings to prioritize key product management and marketing efforts. I first saw the impact of this type of data informed decision-making at Google. Underneath my desk, I kept a server that used data from the Google crawler to benchmark AdSense’s market share relative to our key competitor, Yahoo’s Publisher Network. Since then, I’ve reaffirmed a belief that the best run companies are data-driven, and this skill sets businesses apart from their competition. In 2013, Redpoint partnered two very similar minded entrepreneurs, Frank Bien and Lloyd Tabb, who were building Looker , software to enable every business to use data to create their own competitive advantages. In customer after customer, we’ve all seen this thesis borne out. The best run companies use data to win. So Frank and I wrote a book about it. Winning with Data will be released on June 20. We interviewed many of the top startups in their industries and share our understanding and learning from those interviews and our own experiences.  It’s a book with three sections: The historical challenges faced by companies to used data Case studies of companies using data to win Guides for how to replicate those best practices in your team and company It was great fun to co-author the book and I learned quite a bit about how these businesses structure their data teams, educate the broader company on data analysis tools and techniques, and evolve their cultures.

A senior executive described her management philosophy as heavily influenced by Daniel Pink’s book Drive . In his 20 minute TED talk , Pink argues traditional incentive structures  like bonuses and raises don’t work for knowledge workers. Instead, autonomy, mastery and purpose motivate them best. Autonomy grants employees the flexibility to achieve their goals as they see fit. Purpose means serving a goal larger than the self. Mastery provides employees the opportunities to continuously improve their skills. Sometimes, these three principles are called APM. Pink lauds Google and Atlassian as examples of companies who provide their employees with these three motivators. In particular, both companies have at some point offered their teams 20% time to pursue projects of their choosing. I was really curious about these ideas, because I hadn’t heard of them before this meeting. I learned critics of Pink’s theory characterize it as simplistic. After all, Google is quite well known as a generous employer, rewarding employees handsomely for performance. So motivation isn’t the entire story. In addition, APM assumes employees’ needs are satisfied. But that may not be the case. Psychologist Frederick Herzberg developed Two Factor theory in the 1950s. Two Factor theory posits that the factors that cause employee satisfaction and the factors of the cause employee dissatisfaction differ. Employee dissatisfaction could be caused by a lack of the right tools, an unpleasant working environment, or below-market pay. He called these hygiene factors. Correcting all of those requirements wouldn’t necessarily engender exceptional employee satisfaction.  Rather, high employee satisfaction results from high motivation. That’s where APM comes in, maximizing motivation. We need both sets of needs to be satisfied. But things are even more nuanced yet. Google teaches its managers Situational Management which advocates different styles of management depending on the employee’s state, plotted on a 2x2 matrix of high/low motivation and high/low skill. A new employee, for example, shouldn’t necessarily be afforded total autonomy to maximize their career success. In the end, I don’t think there is a single unifying framework to maximize management effectiveness. Great managers listen, empathize, motivate, and do many other things.  it’s craft, mastered over decades and tens if not hundreds of relationships. Boiling it down to a simple framework might distill pearls of wisdom, but can never confer the benefit of experience. The most important thing I learned from this conversation is to seek out managers who constantly reflect, learn, research and critique the best ways to cultivate their people and teams - the people who love mastering the craft.

Sales velocity is the equation that governs the effectiveness of your SaaS startup’s sales team. Often, sales teams use the word sales velocity to refer to the number of signed contracts in a given month or quarter. But sales velocity classically defined is a different concept. Sales velocity originates from operations research , field of study pioneered by Charles Babbage , one of the fathers of computing, and Georges Doriot , the patriarch of the venture capital industry. Sales velocity measures the output of the sales team in dollars per day or month. To calculate sales velocity, multiply work in progress by win rate and by average price and divide by sales cycle. For example, if the average account executive can manage 20 concurrent client conversations, close 20% of them at $15,000 each in 30 days, that implies a sales velocity of $60,000 per month or $2,000 per day. Let’s walk through each variable. The sales team specialization  advocated by Aaron Ross in Predictable Revenue aims to maximize work in progress. The sales development representatives tackle lead qualification, enabling this account executives to focus exclusively on minimizing the sales cycle and maximizing the win rate. Other factors also impact work in progress. Lead volumes are the most significant. The more qualified leads per account executive, the greater the work in progress per salesperson. Win rate measures the percentage of sales qualified leads that sign a contract. It is impacted by the skill of the sales team and competitive dynamics including the amount of competition, the company’s differentiation relative to its competition, and the strength of the company’s brand. Sales cycle, typically measured in days, tabulates the amount of time required from the first qualification to the customer signing a contract.  Multiparty sales processes, substantial education requirements, and onerous deployments extend sales cycles. Average price is the mean value of contracts sold by an account executive or the team. Price is a marketing tool, that is determined by the company’s competitive positioning (premium versus commodity) and strategy. Sales teams seek to maximize their sales velocity by decreasing sales cycles and increasing prices, win rates and work in progress. But, these numbers don’t move in isolation; they are not independent. Increasing the average price might lengthen the sales cycle and decrease the win rate. Lengthening the sales cycle will decrease the work in progress, as salespeople must spend more time with each client. Some companies measure sales velocity by account executive. Others measure it for the entire team. In the beginning, sales velocity can be quite volatile, particularly as early stage software companies’ lead volumes fluctuate with new paid acquisition channels, and the sales team begins to develop a repeatable sales process. As the business increases prices or addresses a new customer segment or scales the sales team, velocity fluctuates. Also, seasonality in certain businesses can also impact this figure. As a sales team and company mature and attain scale, the variance in this figure should modulate, enabling the company to more consistently predict its growth over time. There is no single way of maximizing sales velocity. These variables are codependent. The first step in deriving value from sales velocity is to consistently measure it. The second step is to determine the sensitivity of sales velocity to variables in your business. These sensitivities will change with time. For example, one year it might be much easier to increase prices then affect any of the other variables. Another year, the productivity of the paid acquisition efforts might swell lead volumes.  Velocity is another way to measure the productivity of sales teams.

A user has maximum intent. She has watched the humorous demo video, chuckled when reading through the clever marketing copy, and filled out the abbreviated, optimized user registration form. She wants to give the product a spin. How long does the account verification link take to appear in her email box? Is it long enough for her to switch tabs, change contexts and lose interest? The half-life for new product trials brief. How many seconds with a user does a product have? The typical web-browser spends 15 seconds on each webpage . When researching new software, those sessions are likely to be a bit longer, but even at a minute, that’s not much time to deliver the email and keep the user moving through the conversion funnel. Some product teams time user acquisition flows and push to reduce them consistently. How quickly can a user sign up and be using the product? AT Google, we used the Usability Lab to see our existing products through the eyes of new users and identify inaccuracies that sapped user intent. Other companies employ ingenious techniques to increase their awareness of user needs. At Facebook, Tuesday mornings are 2G mornings . Hundreds of millions of users experience Facebook only through 2G connections. To build the right product, architect the most effective user flows, and optimize that experience, the product and engineering teams replicate the same network connection speeds. One of the key elements in reducing the cost-of-customer acquisition for SaaS companies is maximizing the user intent. Witty videos, sales pitches, case studies are all essential. And so are the most trivial steps like minimizing the delay to receive the account confirmation email.

There are two common ways to model the growth of a SaaS business I’ve seen in pitches. the first one helps founders develop a sense for the trajectory of the business, while the second one helps teams plan for different scenarios and model the trade-offs with each strategic decision. The Percent Growth technique averages the company’s growth rate over the last quarter or so and projects it forward. For example, if a SaaS company has sustained 15% monthly growth over the last three months and is currently at $10k in MRR, the projections might look like the table below. Frequently  in these models, costs are also modeled growing at a fixed monthly rate. In our example, I’ve assumed about 10 employees with a 10% increase in costs. Month 1 2 3 6 12 MRR, $k 10 11.5 13.2 20.1 46.5 Expenses, $k 150 165 182 242 428 Net, -$k -140 -154 -168 -221 -381 The Percent Technique quickly ballparks the company’s revenue and costs. But this simple model doesn’t provide founders an ability to understand how sensitive the company’s projections are to key assumptions. Scenario exploration and planning can be really useful when thinking through the financial strategy of the business. The Percent Technique cannot answer questions like “How much faster could we grow if we began hiring sales people one quarter faster?” or “How much less would the company burn if we could collect 75% of our bookings dollars up-front?” or “If our cost per lead increases to $5 but our conversion rate doubles, do we need more or less cash?” In addition, the Percent Technique doesn’t consider new costs as the company scales. For example, at some point between Series A and Series B, most SaaS companies hire a sales operations person and sales manager, two roles that were not considered in the cost base beforehand. Model the company’s growth bottoms up by team and we can play with different scenarios. In this case, I’ve modeled the market organization as fundamental units with one account executive earning $110,000 per year, one sales development representative earning $60,000 per year and one customer success manager earning $60,000 per year. Each account executive needs one half of the sales development representative’s time and one quarter of the customer success manager’s time. The account executive on target quota is $500,000 in ARR per year.  The company hires one engineer or product person or designer per month and pays them $150,000 on average. Month 1 2 3 6 12 Fundamental Units of Growth 1 1 1 2 3 Engineers + Product 6 7 8 11 17 Bookings Capacity, $k 3.5 3.5 3.5 6.9 10.4 MRR, $k 10 13.5 16.9 37.8 89.9 FUG Costs 16.5 16.5 16.5 32.9 49.4 Engineers + Product Cost 75 87.5 100 138 213 General & Administrative 25 25 25 25 25 Expenses, $k 116 129 141 195 287 Net, -$k -106 -115 -125 -158 -197 By modeling the business one level deeper, we can now modify the parameters and understand the impact on cash. Even this is a relatively simplistic model, but it is far more incisive than the Percent Technique, because we can begin to play with the timing of hires, which are both the biggest revenue generator for business and also the greatest cost. The next level of modeling would incorporate sales ramp time , sales management hires at different team sizes, some consideration of cost per lead and the conversion funnel metrics, which impact cost customer acquisition, and finally a more granular hiring schedule for the product and engineering teams. This type of scenario planning helps founders and board members understand the trade-offs when evaluating different hiring plans and also different go to market strategies.

What are your top three priorities in your job right now? If I asked you that question, I suspect within a minute or two you could articulate them. Is the software you are selling at your SaaS startup solving one of those three needs for your target customer?  And, if it is, does your software meaningfully differentiate along one of the key competitive axes that your customer cares about? No one has enough time in their jobs to attend to the fifth or sixth most important thing today. So, one of the questions I typically ask potential customers during diligence calls is, “Where on your list of priorities does this problem fall: top 3, top 5, or top 10?”  If the answer is not top three, then the software is not important enough for a buyer to prioritize and champion budget. The startup will observe slower sales cycles because the sales team will be challenged to create urgency within the buyer’s company. The notion of differentiation along a competitive axis demands a bit more nuance.  Sometimes, SaaS companies differentiate themselves on the established competitive axes. Other times, they challenge the buyer to reconsider the parameters by which they judge software. In the world of business intelligence, the competitive axes have remained the same for decades because the question is the same. “How much quicker can the software help my team make better decisions?” Competitive differentiation in BI has historically involved computing more data, increasing the productivity of the data team, and displaying more beautiful charts. Looker brings a unique technology to the business intelligence market that is fueled its explosive growth as it competes on these three axes. First, Looker operates in-database On next generation data warehouses like Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery, which enable it to process more data. Second, LookML, Looker’s data description language, enables everyone within the company to manipulate data as if they understood the data architecture like the data team does. This increases everyone’s productivity. Third, because Looker is web native, the products can leverage the latest advances in visualization technology.   This technology innovation enables the company to develop a substantial go to market advantage . Salesforce dominates Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. CRM buyers want to know, “Will my sales team attain its bookings targets this period?” They have defined the key competitive axes in the category as:   flexible and insightful reporting, breadth of ecosystem, customization ability of the platform. Ultimately, CEOs and VPs of Sales purchase Salesforce for the sales projections it provides. In order for those reports to be accurate, the software must match each organization’s uniquenesses in the sales process and the types of data capture. Overtime, Salesforce has built a massive application ecosystem for both internal applications like the Marketing Cloud and external applications like FinancialForce to integrate. No startup can win when pursuing a strategy to challenge Salesforce head-on on those three axes. It would take the start up too long and consume too much capital to replicate what Salesforce has built, nevermind exceed it. To compete with Salesforce, a startup must change the parameters buyers used to evaluate CRM software. RelateIQ focused on account executive usability to differentiate, arguing simplified data input implies better data quality which leads to greater visibility. When competing along existing axes, the marketing and sales teams’ efforts are often focused on educating customers about the substantially better performance of their product. When seeking to change the axes, marketing and sales initiatives aimed to educate potential customers that they ought to be evaluating products differently. A SaaS startup’s strategy should be to focus on one of the top three problems of their target buyer. In addition, the company should clearly decide whether it is innovating on the existing decision-making parameters of its buyer or seeking to redefine those parameters. And all of the efforts, be they product, engineering, sales or marketing, should support that strategy.

Clay Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor, asserted in a recent interview that we understand only half of the marketing puzzle: the marketing science involved in a competitive ecosystem, when consumers are buying millions of products. In these markets, concepts like Westendorp Price Sensitivity and conjoint analyses work. But to incite disruption requires a different set of marketing skills. In the Innovator’s Solution , Christensen proposes the idea of competing against non-consumption. He says, “A new-market disruption is an innovation that enables a larger population of people, who previously lacked the money or skill, now to begin buying and using a product and doing the job for themselves.” Viewing the SaaS world through this lens, disruption means enabling users to do things for the first time. Because a company’s IT budget is relatively fixed, it also implies shifting budget from one place to another within the customer. Sometimes this budget shift occurs with category creation. Twilio, Gainsight, Duo Security each created a new category -  telephony-as-a-service, customer success, broad two-factor authorization. In most of these cases, customers must allocate new budget to paying for these tools and rationalize it as the cost of doing business. In other cases, substantially better-than-existing solutions at lower price points broaden the addressable market: Slack and Asana have transformed the way colleagues communicate in the workplace, creating new market segments for collaboration tools. At least that’s the way the theory goes. You might argue that Slack and Asana might poach budget from Sharepoint and other collaboration suites. Or Duo’s payments siphon dollars from an extant security budget. And most CIOs foresee only a 1-2% annual increase in total IT outlay in 2016. So perhaps the budgets argument doesn’t hold in every case, but it certainly does in new category creation: marketing automation, customer success, sales lead nurturing and so on. Regardless, the notion of competing against non-consumption as a marketing strategy is still quite a useful way of evaluating ideas for new businesses. It raises the important questions: Where will budget for this software come from? How will buyers think about this solution relative to others? What set of users who were not previously able to use software to satisfy a need or achieve of objective will be served with this innovation? Product marketing at the very earliest stages of a software company demands a different set of disciplines than the post-product-market fit marketing taught in textbooks and business schools. One way of structuring product marketing at these formative stages is to probe whether a new idea competes against non-consumption.

Questions interlace conversations. Where is Priceline stock trading? Where do the San Francisco Giants stand in this year’s pennant race? When hiring a litigation attorney, what are the key questions to ask? Are there any grammatically sound sentences in English where every word starts with the same letter? All of these questions are instantly answerable. These are the types of questions we ask at the dinner table, when sharing a drink with a friend at a bar, and answer in a few seconds a mobile phone with a Google search. At work, we’re thirsty for data to guide and inform decisions and we bring with us similar expectations of technology’s ability to answer questions instantly. As chat becomes an increasingly important user interface in the workplace, there’s a massive opportunity for startups to enrich conversations with answers to questions that pop-up in Slack and elsewhere. Looker’s SlackBot called LookerBot just does this. For example, in this video , Kim and Tommy need to figure out which customers to invite to a beta and they start chatting in the #beta-program channel. Tommy suggests one account, Avino, and then he pulls up their product usage chart in Slack so Kim can see. Enthusiastically, Kim agrees to invite them to the beta. The conversation continues as Kim plans a visit to Avino in New York, and would like to find other potential beta users in the same area. Together, Kim and Tommy view a list of customers in New York, select Granite & Co. as the second beta customer, but notice Granite’s support volume in Zendesk has spiked recently, suggesting there’s a problem with the account. The team checks with Felicia, the customer success rep, by inviting her into the channel. Felicia says all is well with the account - just a routine database migration. The combination of chat and data enables teams to move faster, make better informed decisions, bring in key stakeholders, and document rationales for decisions in case a question arises in the future. It’s the future of collaboration.

Numi is a little calculator with a twist. Unlike most calculators, it understands English and other languages. I’ve used many different types of calculators: from the Texas Instruments TI-89 graphing calculator to a HP 12C with its Polish notation, to software calculators Excel and R. All of them employ similar user interfaces. There’s a syntax to translate the user’s desires into something the calculator can understand. Numi takes that one step further. Numi still requires a learning a syntax, but Numi’s language is far closer to the words and the way I articulate the math problem in my head than anything else. The image above shows how I use Numi. The first four lines tabulate a hypothetical Series A investment. The date math example determines the due date for an internal project. The third converts a British startup’s revenue into dollars. The fourth calculates the post money of $7M investment for 25% ownership using divide by rather than a slash or an obelus . The fifth converts Pacific Time to East Coast time to help with scheduling. Within every great product, there’s a bit of magic. Numi is magical because it anticipates the goals of the user. The app recognizes what I mean when I say divide by or million. Numi fetches the today’s GBP/USD exchange rate by API and completes the foreign exchange. This magic isn’t enabled by some new open source natural language processing library or by advances in deep learning buried in research paper, but product design. When I use Numi I feel like the app understands me, because it knows what I mean by million or New York or divide. I can phrase math problems to Numi similarly to how I would communicate them a person. Advances in machine learning and natural language processing will be key ingredients in the software applications of the future. For example, Numi could use these technologies to begin to learn venture capital jargon and math like calculating the dilution for an employee stock option plan increase. However, these technologies are necessary but insufficient to create magical applications. Empathetic product design sparks magic. That’s the characteristic all great products share - that moment when a user remarks “The app understands me!” and the comprehension barrier between humans’ goals and computers’ actions diminishes just a bit more.

The value of all public technology companies exceeds $10.7T. At the beginning of 2016, that figure touched an all time high of $11T. It’s taken more than a decade for public technology companies to replicate/recreate the market cap observed in the dot-com era, even when adjusting for inflation. The preponderance of that increase has occurred in the last four years. In 2012, global technology companies combined in value to $6.7T, an annual growth rate of about 12.5%. Which era of companies drive this growth? The chart above shows the share of market cap commanded by companies which went public in three different decades: the Nineties, the Dotcom era (2000-2010), and the Cloud era (2010-2020).  Fifteen years on, Dotcom companies have finally superseded Nineties companies in aggregate value. Decade Count Average MC, $B Total, $T Share Legacy 114 18.9 124 2.3 21.8% Nineties 673 4.4 3.2 30.2% Dotcom 3268 3.3 30.1% Cloud 1976 910 1.8 17.2% Cloud era companies now represent about 18% of global IT market cap. At current valuations, all Unicorn companies total about $0.5T. If we assume half of these businesses will go public and discount the market cap figure by 50% to reach $0.25T, Cloud era companies’ share bumps to 18.7%, up from 17.2% This data illuminates three key points. First, founders continue to build massively valuable companies. That the current decade of public companies accounts for nearly a fifth of global IT market cap is astounding. Though the share hasn’t risen as monotonically as for the two previous decades, because the total grew quite quickly in that period. Second, the second chart illuminates the share shift of market cap from older to newer companies is happening.  Cloud companies have taken share from legacy vendors while Dotcom businesses’ share has remained stable. The legacy software vendors and consumer companies’ share of IT market cap has fallen by half in fifteen years. This trend is inexorable. Third, unicorns’ paper valuations today represent about about 5% of global IT market cap. Though there’s no data to prove it, I suspect this is the largest share held by private companies ever. This data point is another indicator of the availability of capital in the late stage private markets. Like the micromills that revolutionized the American steel industry profiled in Clayton Christensen’s Innovators Dilemma, newer and newer startups will continue to propel the global IT market forward, all the while growing the overall IT market and siphoning share from legacy businesses.

What do you look for in SaaS companies? It’s hard to answer this question concisely because there are so many different ways of building a great software business. The best way I’ve found to describe it is a technology innovation leading to a go-to-market advantage. That’s how I answered the question in the 20Minute VC podcast with Harry Stebbings. Software is a competitive world. Sales and marketing software vendors have flourished, growing from a few hundred to several thousand in the span of a few years. The same is true for vertical software, developer software, and every category in between. In such a contentious ecosystem, how does a new business develop a sustainable competitive advantage? Initially, technology differentiates offerings. This technology advantage manifests itself in a few different ways. RelateIQ machine learning to offer an innovative customer relationship management software to sales teams. Looker architected a novel language and execution engine to revolutionize business intelligence. Zendesk, Duo Security and Expensify develop customer service, two-factor authentication and expense management software with radically simpler UIs than their competition. But, technology is not enough. In fact, it is only half of the equation. Innovation = Invention + Go To Market . That initial technology advantage needs engender go to market advantage, a way of educating, convincing, and closing customers more efficiently. Often, these technologies grow the addressable market, alluring new buyers to try software. Zendesk, Duo and Expensify leverage their product advantage to generate massive customer inbound demand, fueling explosive growth. Looker’s architecture empowers data teams to provide operational teams with the data they need to run the business at scale. This unique value proposition reduces sales cycles and leads to substantial negative net churn within accounts. RelateIQ’s technology which addresses the data entry pain suffered by most CRM users uniquely positioned them in the marketplace, and change the way that salespeople evaluate new customer relationship management tools. There are other ways of creating this technology advantage including SaaS Enabled Marketplaces, focusing on a particular vertical and distribution of software through open source. No matter how these businesses generate a technology advantage, the most successful software companies leverage that initial booster rocket into orbit by creating more efficient requisition mechanisms, better upsell and cross sell, and changing the evaluation criteria of the target customer base.

We all recognize great leadership when we see it. But what characterizes great leadership? Is it an inspirational speaker articulating a goosebump-inducing vision? Or an executive with the five universally praised characteristics Stanford professor Jeffrey Pfeiffer identified: modesty, authenticity, truthfulness, trustworthiness and selflessness? Or is it a great manager of people, someone who understands the aspirations of each report, charts a career path, assigns meaningful work along that path, and  champions their promotion? Or perhaps leadership means having the courage to make the hard, but right decision? Nelson Mandela popularized the idea of leading from behind . “It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership.” But Steve Jobs and Jack Welch, two of the iconic business leaders of the past twenty-five years, didn’t shepherd Apple and GE, so much as throw these businesses on their backs and haul them up the mountain. At least, that’s the image they projected; two Titans holding up the sky like [Atlas]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology) . Joshua Rothman asks What is leadership? in Shut Up and Sit Down , a New Yorker primer on leadership books, advice and research. Rothman highlights HBS professor Gautam Mukunda’s research contrasting success by promoting internal leaders with hiring external ones. 	Mukunda observed some organizations like the military filter their leaders by requiring them to rise through their ranks before attaining a leadership position. Companies often hire external CEOs who haven’t been filtered. He concludes filtered candidates ultimately exhibit similar leadership characteristics and success as their predecessor, while unfiltered candidates are highly variable - either much better or much worse than the internal candidate; they are the tails of the Gaussian distribution. I’ve met many leaders of companies and worked for a few. Each leader has a different leadership style. Some ebullient storytellers, bellowing a goosebump-inducing vision on stage to enrapture their teams. More understated leaders from behind laud the accomplishments of their teams, using other voices to captivate. Still others challenge, demand and push. They all lead. Rothman concludes, “To some extent, leaders are storytellers; really, though, they are characters in stories. They play leading roles, but in dramas they can’t predict and don’t always understand” - an unsatisfying answer.  There may never be a canonical definition of great leadership because like writing or speaking or managing, we can be successful with many different styles. Studying other great leaders is important, of course, to add new techniques to a repertoire. The cornerstone of great leadership is authenticity. Leaders ask us to believe, to give more, to sacrifice. To trust a leader, his or her leadership must be genuine, a true reflection of their strengths, values and culture. Leaders can engender that trust in many different ways, leading from the front or the back, provided their authenticity is apparent.

As a SaaS startup grows, recurring revenue begins to fuel the company. Not too far into the future, the existing customer base begins to contribute more of the startup’s revenue than new customers and bookings. Each startup will observe this revenue composition transition at a different point in its evolution because it’s a function of growth rate and churn rate. This evolution demands a focus on retention, upsell and cross-sell. Imagine a hypothetical SaaS startup. The business has just released its product and has one fully ramped account executive with a quota of $600,000. On average, this account executive and all future once hired attain 75% of their quota. The company suffers a revenue churn of 0.5% per month, and has no account expansion. In addition, the startup continues to hire account executives at a pace of one per quarter in the first and second years, and two per quarter in the third and fourth years. Year 1 2 3 4 Account Executives 4 8 16 24 ARR 1.5 5.4 13.1 25.7 Renewals as % of Revenue 0% 26% 37% 46% *Data at Year End* The table above summarizes the company’s growth. Annual recurring revenue at year-end surges from $1.5M at the end of year one, to $5.4M in year two, to $13.1M in year three and $26M in year four. The last line of the table conveys the renewal revenue as a percentage of revenue, net of churn. Within four years, that figure rises from 0% contribution to nearly 50%. The chart at the top of this post compares the revenue contribution from renewals across four different monthly revenue churn rates: 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3%. As the churn rate increases, the startup retains less revenue over time diminishing the share of renewal revenue. Across that spectrum of churn rates, the year 4 share of revenue from renewals drops from 46% to 28%. Startups that grow faster will also observe a slower growth rate in their share of revenue from renewals as bookings strives to keep pace with the expanding existing customer business. As a maturing SaaS company approaches 50% of revenue generated from renewals, customer success  should rise in strategic importance to the business. After all, customer success generates half of the company’s revenue. In addition, as the startup develops new products and/or capacity to expand accounts, the customer success team new bookings also becomes a material consideration. And the VP of CS contributes as much revenue as the VPS. If the company can engender a 30% negative churn in their customer base, similar to Box at IPO, then in year four, the customer success team piles another $5.9M in new bookings on top of the $21M bookings from the 24 member sales team, a 28% boost. This is the power of the compounding effect of SaaS companies’ subscription models. Like high interest bank accounts, the core of the business continues to grow and becomes an increasingly invaluable opportunity, one that requires a strategic shift in thinking to seize.

The startup fundraising market in 2016 has been difficult to characterize. Punctuated by a concentrated decline in public tech stocks, the sentiment in Startupland has changed from resolute ebullience to a calmness approaching caution. Two months in, we can analyze January and February data. This posts analyses US headquartered information technology companies which VC-led investment rounds, except for the $793M Series C in Magic Leap , which I excluded as an outlier. VCs invested about $2B in January and February 2016. The January figure equals the previous year, but February dollars deployed halved compared to 2015, reverting to 2014 levels. The count of investments fell in January by 44% to roughly 130 and remained there in February. ![image]( https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/median_investment_size_early_2016 .png) For January investment round volumes to fall and for total dollars invested to remain the same, VCs must have invested in a disproportionate share of large, later stage rounds. As the year continued, round volumes held steady, but total dollars invested halved indicating the typical investment fell substantially. And the median investment chart above supports this hypothesis. Let’s break this overall figure into Series A, B, C and Seed median investment sizes. Series As have fallen from their late 2015 highs by about 20%. The median Series B totals less than $15M, down 25% from the 2015 highs. Series Cs are stable at about $35M, and seed rounds continue their ascent with the typical Seed round at more than $2M. The Seed round figure might be spurious. Without a fixed definition of a seed round, this number can move as the market includes a greater or lesser number of financings in this colloquial term. We can segment the data by round size: rounds less than $2.5M, $15M, $50M, and greater 50+. Median seed rounds are then dominated by the +/- $150k initial investments of incubators and accelerators with large new portfolios like YCombinator and 500Startups whose demo days are fast approaching. The differing data points suggest to me small Series As and Seeds are being further conflated; for entrepreneurs it’s often better to characterize a $3M round as a seed, rather than a Series A. No analysis is perfect. But this data does provide a lens into the state of the fundraising market. Series A and B sizes are down from their highs. Overall investment in February halved. But the data raises more questions. What is really happening with seed round size? Was VC activity in February an aberration or representative of a deeper change in sentiment? In all likelihood, February was a bit of a wait-and-see month. Most importantly, the data supports the notion that investors are still looking to invest, and round sizes are relatively stable. with the exception of the B. The Series B will likely be the most challenging round to raise in the beginning of this year.

In “ How People Learn to Become Resilient ” Maria Konnikova retells the story of Norman Garmezy and George Bonnano, the first developmental psychologists to study grit and resilience. It’s only when you’re faced with obstacles, stress, and other environmental threats that resilience, or the lack of it, emerges: Do you succumb or do you surmount?…One of the central elements of resilience, Bonnano has found, is perception: Do you conceptualize an event as traumatic, or as an opportunity to learn and grow? These researchers propose an important corollary to their fieldwork: resilience can be taught. It’s a mindset of choosing how to react to circumstances and situations, and a belief that you can change those circumstances. As I read this article, I remembered a conversation with a friend at the Grove, a bustling, campy lunch spot at the corner of 3rd and Mission. “Entrepreneurship is my telos,” he said. “What’s a telos?” I asked. Telos means an end, a goal that defines the person. Plato and Aristotle wrote about telos : both agreed every person seeks to actualize his/her potential. And my friend’s ultimate goal, his fulfillment is starting companies. Many great entrepreneurs I’ve met embody both of these characteristics: unflagging resilience and a clear understanding of their ultimate purpose. They reinforce the other. A strong sense of purpose bolsters the spirit in challenging times, and persistent resilience sustains a founder to ultimately attain their telos. The notion that resilience can be taught echoes the idea that great founders can come from anywhere . Wherever they come from, they will be pursuing their telos.

This weekend the New York Times Magazine published the annual Work Issue, a compendium of 9 articles reimagining the modern workplace. They span topics from building the perfect team, to managing a company fewer meetings, to eliminating bias in recruiting processes - even the social ramifications of so many people eating lunch at their desks, “desktop dining.” It’s a wonderful collection of points of view on different management topics that affect startups. The first article How to Build a Perfect Team profiles an internal project inside Google to identify the characteristics of great teams. First, on the good teams, members spoke roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon researchers referred to as the quality and distribution of conversational turn-taking…Second, the good teams all had high average social sensitivity, a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal clues. Google’s research supports work completed by Alex Pentland and Nada Hashmi of MIT, published similar results in 2010 in the journal Science and Mark Twain’s retort: Wisdom is the reward you get for a lifetime of listening when you’d rather have been talking. The War on Meetings revisits Paul Graham’s seminal essay on Makers versus Managers and the different ways they each work at work. In addition, the article delves into holacracy , the radical management philosophy adopted by Zappos, Medium and some non-profits, that champions employee self-organization and a rigorous way of communicating involving tensions, clarifying questions and amendments & clarifications. Also notable is Rethinking the Work-Life Equation which surfaces the way BDO, a large accounting firm, helps employees manage stress with  the option to work from home for up to two days per week.  “Workplace stress often is more accurately described as workplace guilt, an especially corrosive form of distress ” One startup I work with has two Maker Days, days when no meetings are allowed and employees are encouraged to work from home or outside the office. The cultural impact and productivity impact has been meaningful. Most importantly about all these articles, they ask more questions than they answer. After all, no single prescriptive piece of advice will apply universally to companies. But, the research and experiences highlighted in the the Work Issue will provoke conversation in board rooms, executive offsites and at the (virtual) watercooler about what the office of the future means for each company.

The single most important business decision in evaluating a business is pricing power. And if you need a prayer session before raising price, then you’ve got a terrible business –Warren Buffett I read this quote in Confessions of the Pricing Man: How Price Affects Everything , written by Hermann Simon. Simon is a former academic, an ex-professor at INSEAD Stanford, Harvard, and London business schools, who extensively researched and taught pricing theory. As Simon writes in the book, he left academia in 1985 to found Simon-Kucher & Partners, the preeminent pricing consultancy that generates several hundred million dollars a year in revenue and employs more than 300 people. Pricing power, or market power, is the ability of a startup to raise prices over time.  As Simon writes later in his book, “People have asked me thousands of times to name the most important aspect of pricing. I answer with one word: value.”  A startup gains pricing power when it creates tremendous value for its users and defend its products from the threat of substitutes and new entrants . The second component is equally critical to sustaining pricing power as the first. In Zero to One , Peter Thiel professes the same concept: founders should aim to create monopolies. Monopolistic companies have ultimate pricing power. Simon-Kucher Partners surveyed companies across 50 countries for their Global Pricing Study. Only 1/3 of respondents believed their companies had a high level of pricing power. Does your business? All of these concepts of pricing, pricing power, value, and defensibility contribute to finding product/market fit. True product market fit should be lasting and enduring product market fit. That means creating disproportionate value for users and buyers of software over time. So the startup can charge more and more for its product as the product improves, broadens and is used by increasingly notable customers. Transient product market fit, often can manifest as first-mover advantage. The first company to create a category, define a new product, bring a new technology to a market, or exploit a novel distribution strategy does have short-term pricing power. But without a strong defense, it may be the last mover that wins the race . Quoting Thiel again, “Microsoft was the last operating system, and Google was the last search engine.” Startups need the 1-2 punch of first mover and a competitive defense Pricing evolves as the market changes with the entry of substitutes and threats. Pricing evolves as a startup’s product matures, its brand solidifies and its team coheres. Because of all these conflating factors, pricing discovery is a challenging, ongoing process. The optimal price to charge is a function of the value the product creates and the leverage the business has within the ecosystem. When experimenting with price, two questions matter. First, the relative pricing question : how much are you willing to pay relative to a comparable product?  Second, what do our customers’ reactions to our pricing changes imply about our business’ defensibility and pricing power? Consequently, what are the implications for our startup’s strategy?

A dollar is a dollar is a dollar, right? Not quite. Not all revenue dollars are created equal, but all gross profit dollars are. Gross profit, not revenue, is the metric companies should be using to compare themselves. Ultimately, gross profits account for more than 55% of the forward multiple of publicly traded SaaS companies after normalizing for revenue growth. SaaS companies vary hugely in their gross margins. BenefitFocus, Five9 and Shopify operate at 45-55% gross margins. On the other end of the spectrum, Tableau, LogMeIn and LinkedIn record 86%+ gross margins. The median sits at 68.3% across all these companies over the past 12 months of earnings. What is gross profit? Below is the profit and loss, also called the net income statement, of a hypothetical SaaS company generating $10M annually. It’s a simple P&L, and some companies statements can be more complex. Income Statement figures in millions Revenue 10 Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) 2 Gross Profit 8 Gross Margin, % 80 Sales & Marketing 4 Research and Engineering 2 General & Administrative 1 Net Income 1 Net Margin, % 10 The business generated $10M in revenues in the past year. It spent $2M in Cost of Goods Sold. COGS include all the operational costs the business incurs to provide the service. This includes web hosting, software licensing fees for software embedded into the product like databases, and the customer success initiatives to on-board and retain customers. COGS also includes the salaries of the professional services (PS) team when customers pay for PS customization and training time. In a previous analysis , we saw the margin on PS varies widely by company. Certain companies resell other businesses products, which also contributes to COGS. For example, Five9 provides call center software and telephony software. Five9 buys telephone minutes from telephone companies and packages these minutes with their software so customers can make outbound calls through the Five9 software. The fees Five9 pays to telephone companies is a Cost of Goods Sold. Subtracting COGS from Revenue yields Gross Profit. Gross Profit divided by Revenue equals Gross Margin. Below Gross Profit, the Net Income Statement lists three categories of expenses: Sales & Marketing, Research & Development, and General & Administrative. The first two are expenses to generate new businesses and new products. The third includes the salaries of the CEO, back-office staff and other expenses. Subtracting these expenses from Gross Profit produces Net Income, and dividing Net Income by Revenue leaves us the Net Margin (%). A positive Net Margin means the company is profitable. That summarizes the Income Statement. But let’s get back to why Gross Profit matters so much. Basically, Gross Profit is the amount of money a business can invest in its growth. Let’s compare a business with 5% gross margin to one with 95% gross margin - an extreme example. If each sells $10M a year, the first can invest $0.5M in growth and the second $9.5M in growth. The second business has 19x the capital to invest in acquiring new customers and building new products. Using real examples, BenefitFocus must sell twice as many $50k contracts as Tableau to invest the same amount in Sales and Marketing. For two directly competitive companies, Gross Margin improvements translate into a  competitive advantage. Gross margin can be an important strategic asset because better gross margins improve the capital efficiency of the business. The higher the gross margin, the more revenue can be reinvested in growth, the less money the business must raise to grow, the less dilution incurred. Not all revenue dollars are created equal, but all gross profit dollars are. That’s why gross profit is the gold standard to compare startups, not revenue.

At SaaStr 2016 and SaaS Office Hours in New York , I shared an analysis of the fastest growing SaaS companies over the last 3 years. In particular, I benchmarked the revenue, growth rates and round size characteristics of these businesses at their Series A. I’ve embedded the slides here. Benchmarking Exceptional Series A SaaS Companies from Tomasz Tunguz These are the key bullet points from the deck about exceptional SaaS companies. Note: there are two key statistical biases in this analysis: survivorship bias and sample size bias. This analysis considers only a small fraction of the total number of SaaS companies. These businesses grow from 10k to 93k in MRR in their first year of commercialization and then to 413k of ending MRR in their second. On average, they raise $9.5M in Series A, though there is a range from smaller rounds of $3M to rounds of greater than $20M. That range is more indicative of the breadth of different rounds the market calls Series As. The average is more representative. The average round size has been increasing by 11% annually. And this growth parallels the overall startup Series A size which has reached similar highs to rounds in 2000. As round sizes have increased, so too has MRR at the time of the series A. Companies in the set who raised in 2014 recorded $50k in MRR at the time of the A. That figure has grown each year by 80%, and for the investments that closed in early 2016, that figure reached $163k. The increase is driven both by larger seed round sizes enabling companies to raise later, hence more MRR, and also the greater expectations in the fundraising market given larger check sizes sought by founders. Surprisingly, 27% of these companies raise Series A with $0k in MRR, before the business has commercialized the software. At this point, investors are betting on the team’s unique backgrounds, approach to the market or some other characteristic of the opportunity. Unlike later rounds, Series A pricing has no correlation to MRR or next-twelve-months (NTM) revenue, which is a proxy for growth rate. This lack of a relationship indicates the Series A market pricing is more of a function of supply and demand and the ability of the founders to engender an active auction, than a mark-to-market pricing event. But 2016 will likely herald some changes in the market, so many of these metrics will evolve this year. 2014 and 2015 were two of the largest VC investment years in the last 20. And to put things into context, seed investment has grown 5x since 2010, Series A investment has doubled and Series B+ has tripled. The recent drops in Q4 of between 15-20% in those stages are material, but we’re still in an elevated investment environment compared to 2010. The public markets have repriced SaaS companies, halving their forward multiples and founders are feeling this in the private markets. First Round surveyed founders and found 66% expect the fundraising market to be more challenging in 2016 than 2015. Consequently, there are three major themes of 2016 for the Series A SaaS market. First, public market declines will pressure valuations. Second, unit economics matter. Growth at any cost won’t be handsomely rewarded as in the past. Third, M&A will pick up as there’s nearly $400B of cash on the balance sheets of big corporates and less than 2% of current IT market cap is cloud.

Each new year, I try to implement a new productivity hack. Getting Things Done . Bullet Notebook . This year, I’m trying to manage my to do list with my calendar. I realized a few years ago no arsenal of productivity hacks will prolong the working week, this February’s 29th day notwithstanding. That’s the challenge with to do lists - they lack commitment devices . A commitment device is a “way to change one’s own incentives to make an otherwise empty promise credible .” And what is a task on a list but an empty promise? Have you used a to-do list app that’s asked you, Do you really have time to achieve all this today? Or decided on your behalf that the task you’re adding isn’t important? I haven’t. To do lists fail because the user’s good intention and optimistic aspirations go unchecked. For the software, the marginal cost to add a new task is zero. For me, it’s a quarter of an hour or more. Managing tasks by calendar is the only productivity hack that recognizes this reality. Cue the calendar. When accepting a task, this philosophy proposes immediately allocating time in the calendar to accomplish it. Consider the due date, the time required, and the relative importance. Then book the slot. This extra step reinforces the rigid time constraint immediately, not later when I’m staring at a lengthy to-do list and wondering where to begin. Each yes to a commitment is an implicit no to another. The calendar visualizes the tradeoff of each potential yes, making explicit the commitment to a task. Last, I find scheduling tasks this way encourages batching work. An hour at the beginning and end of each day for email, but not in the rest of the day. Forty five minutes per week for quick calls. Bigger scheduling blocks seem to fall out of this type of task management and less context switching means more productivity. Like all productivity hacks and New Year’s resolutions, managing tasks by calendar requires consistency and discipline. But this is one of the few productivity hacks that recognizes and reinforces the immutable constraints of time.

Attorneys witness the changes in the fundraising market from a unique vantage point. Consiglieri to startup founders and investors alike, attorneys assist in the negotiation and are privy to the terms of investment. Fenwick & West, one of those law firms, released data this morning detailing the evolution of financing terms for Q4. I’ve reproduced the most salient difference in Q4 compared to previous periods above. The median growth in startup valuation has fallen from a high of 74% in Q2 2016 to 39% in Q4. The difference in median valuations with such a decline is substantial. Above, I’ve plotted the valuation progression of a Series A company at $20M growing at 79% by round and 39% by round to illustrate the impact. Of course, as the first chart shows, the median increase in valuations is highly volatile, so assuming a consistent appreciation isn’t necessarily representative. We did observe a similar dip in median mark-up after the market fluttered in Q2 15, a blip that lasted just one quarter. As in the public markets, so too in the privates. Software/SaaS companies benefitted 12-18 months ago from premium markups, often 15-20 percentage points higher. And according to Fenwick data, some subset of these startups raised rounds in Q4 at 29% increases, compared to the 39% of the venture industry as a whole.  This makes sense. In the past, SaaS companies have benefitted from higher absolute prices than the rest of the venture industry. The Fenwick data shows the new season in venture capital started in Q4, earlier than the public market compression in early Q1 16. And it’s consistent with other data sets from Pitchbook and CBInsights that show a softening of the market in Q4. The rest of the Fenwick & West report details the changes in key terms of termsheets including participation, liquidation preferences, ratchets, antidilution and redemptions. These surveys are useful to understand market terms and their evolution. At this point, only the median increase in valuation has shifted substantially.

Join me for SaaS Office Hours on February 22 in New York at the Axial headquarters. This is the first time we’ll be hosting SaaS Office Hours on the East Coast, and there will be more to follow. Given the volatility in the market and the number of inbound questions about the implications, this SaaS Office Hours will be focused on fundraising and the venture capital outlook for 2016. During the course of the event, I’ll review key metrics about the state of the SaaS environment, discuss the key milestones for raising series As, talk about investment trends in the market and then open the session to question and answer. As always, the event will be small and intimate. These events are in person, so register only if you are certain you can attend on the evening of February 22 between 530 and 730. Our goal is to create an intimate environment for founders and executives to network and learn. We’ll continue to experiment with the program over time. If you have feedback, suggestions or ideas, please email me using the link on the top right of this page.

Most modern data architectures employ many different data stores and processing engines. Hadoop, Cassandra, HBase, Spark, Storm, Phoenix. Data analysts looking to unearth insights within these data stores must move data back and forth between different systems and different data formats. As the number of new open source projects continues to grow geometrically, this data fragmentation is likely to splinter further. Apache Arrow is a new open-source project that helps data analysts wrestle diverse data sets into a single format. Apache Arrow is a collaborative effort that spans many of the largest providers and users of data infrastructure today including Amazon, Cloudera, Databricks, DataStax, Dremio, Hortonworks MapR, Salesforce, Trifacta and Twitter. That so many different companies can collaborate on one initiative to improve data analysis industry-wide is a testament to the power of open-source to inspire and engender great change. I’m really excited about this project. I write many of the analyses for this blog in R and I’ve seen this data fragmentation problem for myself and across many different companies. It’s one of the major reasons Redpoint invested in Dremio : to solve fragmentation for data engineers.  As Wes McKinney, author of Pandas, the most widely distributed Python data analysis toolkit, says, “Arrow will enable Python and R to become first class languages across the entire Big Data Stack.” Arrow promises data engineers three things. First, data engineers can access data  across the many different stores within their infrastructure through Arrow’s common format. Second, engineers’ analyses will conclude faster because Arrow takes advantage of innovations in CPUs to parallelize computation. Third, polyglot support: analyze data in whatever language whether R, Python, Julia, Javascript, C++, or Java. In short, faster data analysis in many different languages across more data. Apache Arrow is one of the fastest projects to attain Top Level Project status, a fact that underscores the need for the technology, the strength and breadth of the coalition to support it, and the potential to change the way data analysts work today.

There are several forms of venture debt. Convertible notes are the most common, today. Most startups raise seed rounds using convertible notes. Startups that have substantial working capital requirements often employ lines of credit/revolvers. Last, many startups take out term loans. They borrow money for several years and repay it over time. Venture debt can supply additional capital for a startup to grow at a lower cost of capital than equity. And the difference can be material. A hypothetical startup raises $5M at Series A and sells 25%. Then they raise $2M of venture debt. In addition to the interest that must be repaid on the debt, the lender also receives warrants (options to buy shares) typically between 5-20% of the amount of money lent. In this case, 20% of $2M is $400k worth of warrants or about another 2% of shares. The $5M in equity costs 25% and the $2M in debt costs 2% in warrants plus interest over the course of the loan. Of course, the debt must be repaid, so it’s not quite the same, but the marginal impact to dilution of the insurance policy and/or runway extension is meaningful. Debt can delay the timing of the next raise and reduce dilution. A startup growing at 15% per month will double revenues after five months. At this point, the company should command twice the valuation when it raises its next round. So, the startup should then be able to raise more capital at the same dilution or suffer less dilution for the same amount of capital. Term loans can be quite useful for SaaS startups. SaaS companies benefit from high gross margins and relatively predictable businesses. With a known sales quota, sales attainment, cash collections and churn rate, a SaaS startup should enable the business to model a conservative scenario for growth and cash flows, and determine whether the business can support paying the principal and interest over time, or with an interest only payments until the loan matures and a balloon payment at the end. Not all investors advocate for venture debt. Fred Wilson wrote a post in 2011 : “I’m not a fan of venture debt for early stage companies. If the startup is getting the money because of the credit worthiness of my firm and the other firms in the deal, then I’d rather be putting more equity in instead and getting paid for my capital at risk.” In addition to Fred’s points, there are risks. If the business cannot repay its debt, the lender has several recourses, which can be serious. They include controlling the business’ bank accounts and taking possession of the business. Like any debt, before deciding to assume it, the borrower must weigh the benefits and the risks. Lenders also weigh these risks. Glen Mello, a managing director at Silicon Valley Bank, which lends quite a bit to startups, explains how his firm lends in this interview conducted by Jay Azcuno at NextView . “Cash is actually a big piece of the analysis. Among the elements we look at are the burn, the cost to hit certain milestones or inflection points and whether or not there’s a buffer built in, whether we’re providing the buffer or the equity investors are providing it, and so on.” Venture debt can be a useful financing option for SaaS companies to elongate  runways, command higher valuations and suffer less dilution to achieve growth. The predictability of a well-understood SaaS business enables the founding team to project how much, if any debt, the startup can support. Like every financing strategy, there are pros and cons to debt and understanding them is essential. A good startup attorney can help.

When we discuss payback periods in SaaS, we implicitly mean customer payback periods.   How much time does it take for us to recoup the capital outlay we invest in acquiring a new customer? But,  there’s a second and equally important payback period  – the payback period on hiring a new account executive. Let’s take a hypothetical SaaS startup that sells a $20k product at a 75% gross margin. Clients pay monthly and commissions are paid monthly. The company hires a new account executive in month 1. The AE has an on-target-earnings (OTE) of $60k base/$60k commission and a quota of $600k. The AE is given 5 months to ramp to full quota: 0% in the first month, 25% the second, 50% in the third, etc. The chart above shows the cash flows associated with the hire. I’m assuming the AE attains exactly 100% of quota in each month. The company incurs $5k of expense in the first month, marked in red. This figure grows and stabilizes at $10k per month as the AE ramps and attains full quota. The positive cash flows in blue grow over time. These the collections from new business booked by this account executive. The investment in hiring this account executive breaks even on a gross profit basis in month 8. In other words, the business has collected enough cash from new customers sold by the AE to offset the training costs and compensation costs of the account executive. But the AE isn’t alone. The AE must be complemented with sales development, leads, and customers success to create a fundamental unit of growth . If we assume the AE needs 75% of the time of a sales development rep with lead generation at a salary of $60k, about 35 leads per month acquired at $5 per lead, and 30% of the time of a customer service rep also at $60k, then the breakeven time extends to 10 months. If we change the payment terms to annual prepay, then the breakeven period on the AE alone drops to three months. The chart above contrasts the payback on monthly v. annual plans on the AE alone. The fundamental unit, including the SDR and CSM, repays itself in five months. All the up-front cash coming in from new clients offsets costs very quickly. This analysis further supports the idea that SaaS companies should move to annual pre-pay, in addition to the cost of customer acquisition argument . Startups with annual prepay, strong sales training and sales operations can afford to hire salespeople more quickly because they can breakeven on the investment in less than half the time of competitors who collect cash monthly.

As the fundraising environment changes, some SaaS companies will look to reach cash flow break even on their existing reserves. Founders may reduce staff, particularly in recruiting or new projects that the company prefers not to finance. But there are three other ways to become profitable that limit reductions in force, enable the company to continue to grow with greater efficiency and  increase the value of the company in the process. First, collect cash sooner with annual pre-pay contracts . All of the cost of customer acquisition for a SaaS company is borne in the first month or so. The chart above, copied from David Skok’s great SaaStr presentation , shows the unit cash flow for monthly payment plans. This company invests $12k in month one to acquire a customer and receives $1k in payment, netting -$11k in cash flow. Each subsequent month, the startup receives another $1k in cash and breaks even on that customer a year later. Growing this way requires a lot of cash to finance the acquisition investment. 25 new customers per month implies a cash investment of $300k. By collecting the cash up-front, startups neutralize this effect. The transition to annual prepay isn’t easy. It requires changing the sales process, likely suffering some decreased sales velocity and tinkering with compensation structures. But the impact on cash is hard to overstate. Second, slow sales hiring. When a startup hires a salesperson, they don’t just bear the cost of that new account executive, but all the infrastructure to support and ensure the success of the AE. This collection of people and capital is the fundamental unit of SaaS growth . Some fraction of a sales development rep to qualify leads. Some fraction of a marketing person and some incremental marketing spend. Some fraction of a customer success manager. Some fraction of a post-sales/professional services consultant. All in, the investment could be close to a $1M. The payback period for that investment can be quite long . Three months to recruit a new account executive. Six months to ramp. During those nine months, the company continues to outlay cash without generating much revenue.  Hiring substantially ahead of plan or ahead of unit economics can be quite expensive. The longer new sales reps need to attain quota, the longer the payback period on the fundamental unit. Scenario Qualified Lead Sales Call Demo Close Funnel Yield Base 15% 20% 50% 80% 1.2% Improve Leakiest Part by 5 pp 20% 20% 50% 80% 1.6% Improve Most Efficient Part by 5pp 15% 20% 50% 85% 1.3% Examine the lead-to-close funnel and fix the leakiest part. The table above describes a hypothetical sales funnel of a startup. The first row describes the status quo: 15% email to lead conversion, 20% lead to sales call conversion, 50% sales call to demo, and an 80% demo-to-close. The later parts of the funnel are quite efficient. Overall, the funnel converts about 1.2% of emails. Suppose we could improve the funnel conversion rates by 5 percentage points. If we apply those 5 percentage points to the email-to-lead stage, our funnel yield improves to 1.6%, a sales pipeline efficiency gain of 33%. If instead we apply those five points to the most efficient step, demo-to-close, our yield improves to 1.3% for an 8% gain. Improving the leakiest part of the funnel will improve overall efficiency much faster. These three techniques can help companies explore ways to attain profitability more rapidly.

Mr. Market is a fictitious character imagined by legendary investor Benjamin Graham in The Intelligent Investor . Graham describes Mr. Market as emotional, irrational, moody - and is in the short run a voting machine, in the long run a weighing machine. It might sound like a children’s story, but Warren Buffett lauded the book as the greatest book ever written on investing. So, has is halving of SaaS multiples the work of irrational Mr. Market or a change from the voting machine to a weighing machine? One of my partners suggested answering this question by correlating the declines in stock price to key financial metrics: annual revenue growth, net margin (net income/revenue) and cash flow margin (unlevered free cash flow/revenue). The chart above shows the stock price declines correlate with -0.59 R^2 to revenue growth. In other words, the faster the company is growing, the harsher the stock price decline. That’s counterintuitive.  Normally, it’s the inverse: the faster the company is growing the smaller the price contraction. A company’s profitability, or net margin, has no impact on the valuation drop. The R^2 is -0.06, completely uncorrelated. Equally so, unlevered cash flow margin is similarly uncorrelated. So the price movements in these names seemingly aren’t influenced at all by the profit and cash flow characteristics of these businesses, positive or negative. What could this mean? Assuming the market is moving according to a rational motives, then there seems to be a broad, widespread selling of high growth SaaS companies irrespective of their bottom lines. Perhaps this is fueled by concern that the growth rates of these businesses are not sustainable and consequently, multiples should compress dramatically .  LinkedIn’s less-than-rosy outlook certainly weighed heavily on their stock price. Even as growth may fall, 30 of the 44 companies analyzed demonstrated positive cash flow and 17 of them posted profits. For the public market over the past few days, these attributes haven’t mattered, indicating Mr. Market may be voting more than he is weighing.

What a difference a month makes. I wrote a post on January 10, 2016 called The Downward Pressure of Public Markets on Startup Valuations that depicted the slow decline of SaaS multiples in the public markets. Since then, multiples have compressed markedly. The chart above shows the forward revenue to enterprise value multiple of all public SaaS companies. Remember the heyday in March 2014? We’re 57% below that high at 3.3x forward revenues. A month ago, the market traded these businesses at 4.2x, so a 21% fall in four weeks, punctuated by a 40%-50% decline in LinkedIn and Tableau* last Friday. The quartile chart sheds a bit more light into the story. The high fliers in the top 2 quartiles fell  furthest. To put the figures into perspective, a company generating $100M in revenue next year, growing at more than 70% annually, is worth around $500M. $100M in revenue - not ARR. If you were waiting for a substantial pricing harbinger for a weaker startup fundraising market ahead, this is probably it. Particularly so if the pricing decline we witnessed on Friday continues. Fundraising is a train and the public markets are the locomotive. It can take a while for the public market’s impact to be felt in the private markets, but there’s no denying the locomotive has halved its speed in 24 months. What does this mean? We’ve been in a seller’s market for many years. Now, for many parts of the startup ecosystem we’re entering a buyer’s market. Another type of founder leverage and option value become important. Another financial plan is key to weathering the environment . A different strategy is required. This isn’t like 2000 . The go-to-market advantages of SaaS including faster sales cycles, beneficial cash cycles, online/mobile acquisition and bottoms up adoption are real, enduring , transformative changes. But we may be entering an era when 50% annual growth at cash flow breakeven is the norm, rather than 400% annual growth, burning multiples of revenue. Many software survivors of the dot-com crash pursued a more conservative strategy and were rewarded for their prudence. An example of a relatively extreme case, from 2001 to 2007, Concur grew between 0% and 35% each year. It took the company nearly five years to double revenue from $35.7M in 2000 to $71.8M in 2005, but they were nearly cash-flow break-even throughout the period. Ultimately, Concur sold for $8.3B . Operating a startup this way requires a financial and operating discipline that we haven’t seen in startupland for quite a while.  If this pricing environment persists, that rigor may be the key to ultimate success. NB: Tableau is perpetual license, not pure SaaS, but I’ve included them because I consider them part of the new software movement.

Leverage. It’s the key to negotiating. Classic negotiating books like Getting to Yes define the BATNA, the Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement. If you were to walk away from a conversation, what’s the next best choice? The BATNA singlehandedly creates leverage in negotiating. Over the last few years, startup founders have exerted tremendous leverage in the fundraising market by taking advantage of the supply/demand imbalance. Too much capital chasing a sliver of exceptional startups. When demand exceeds supply, valuations and round sizes balloon. A fast-growing startup’s BATNA had been the other investor waiting in the lobby, term sheet in hand. But the nature of leverage in fundraising conversations is changing. The 40%+ share price declines of Tableau and LinkedIn this morning  illustrate the turbulence a company’s valuation can experience when growth slows or the finicky market decides to value it differently. The 16%+ drop in Q4 2015 figures indicate some softening in the venture market too. Fast growth and high burn rates today put startups in a precarious position. There may not be a BATNA, another investor in the lobby, in 2016. So the BATNA is a reduction in force, aka a layoff. Fast growth at efficient burn rates is in vogue today. The closer to cash-flow break-even (CFBE) a startup is, the better their BATNA. At CFBE, the business doesn’t have to raise capital to continue to grow. The founders control their own destiny and possess the ultimate BATNA to keep fueling the business’ growth with the company’s revenues. Consequently, the startup can exert enormous leverage in fundraising conversations, particularly, if the business is growing at an attractive clip. The BATNA is increasing the value of a self-sustaining, growing, healthy business. I’m not advocating that startups all push immediately to reach CFBE. But I do believe that founders should always have mapped a path to CFBE on the current cash reserves of the business . This self-sustaining plan a valuable call option to have in uncertain times. As the environment evolves and prices fall, the strongest BATNA for startups will metamorphose with it. In a tempestuous market, self-determination through positive cash flow may be the best bargaining chip in a fundraising conversation. “Give me a lever long enough and fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world,” wrote Archimedes. The dynamics of the fulcrum and the lever will be different in 2016, but startup founders will still move the world.

When buying machine learning enabled software, it’s easier to sell like Ironman than Robocop; a product that complements and augments the user’s skills rather than a true replacement. As machine learning continues to become a key differentiator among SaaS products, a secular and positive trend, startups are learning how to sell the promise of the software better and better. These are some of the objections customers raise during those sales pitches. First, there’s a skepticism amongst buyers that a computer model can fully understand the complexity of a business process, handle exceptions and perform work equally well as a person. Many products have over-promised and under-delivered. For years, speech recognition sold a great promise. Only recently do millions of people reliably use Siri. Consequently, buyers have become skeptics of seemingly-too-good-to-be-true-intelligence. In some cases, machine learning models have become sufficiently accurate and predictive that could entirely replace people. And at at some point, the software will enable workers to shift from traditional tasks to higher level work. But most buyers are not keen to engage a salesperson selling them software that will replace them. Second, no buyer wants to hear that their business isn’t a snowflake. Each company has unique attributes to their brand, processes, and methodologies that form part of their sales pitch, their recruiting pitch and their culture. A one-size-fits all black box pitched confers a feeling the vendor views all businesses as the same. Buyers fear that the machine learning software fails to recognize the quirks that define the culture and differentiate the business. Last, most machine learning tools don’t convey the rationale of the recommendation sufficiently well for users to understand. Humans are still better at connecting the dots to explain the increase in revenue or the decline in user churn. For SaaS companies, sales velocity is a competitive advantage . And machine learning is becoming another. When selling machine learning enabled software, consider these sales objections to minimize your startup’s sales cycle and position the company for success. Empower your buyer like Ironman.

I know 12 things about you. You have a great need for other people to like and admire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others’ statements without satisfactory proof. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Security is one of your major goals in life. Was I right? In 1948, a psychologist named Bertram Forer offered a group of psychology students a bespoke personality sketch to each student. After interviewing each undergraduate, he provided them with this list above. Forer then asked each student to rate the accuracy of the sketch from 1 to 5. In aggregate, the students scored the assessments as 4.3 - highly accurate. Unbeknownst to the class, Forer had provided the same list of traits to each student. Called the Forer Effect , this test exposed the human cognitive bias that fortune tellers, astrology and personality tests exploit. We will attribute high confidence, uniqueness and fidelity to descriptions of our personalities or personal situations despite their vagueness. These imprecise pronouncements are broad enough to apply to thousands and potentially millions of people. When receiving advice for your startup, remember the Forer Effect. As content marketing has become more important, advice is constructed to take advantage of the Forer Effect to maximize this distribution, whether deliberately or not. Topics and titles with broad addressability generate more traffic and reinforce particular writing patterns. This pattern is also true in conversations. There’s no malice involved. Rather, most advice comes from a good place, a genuine desire to help, to share and to explore collaboratively. But as I’ve learned writing this blog, experimentation and data analysis will lead authors to share those insights in the most generalizable way possible. Parse out the portions of advice that are trenchant and uniquely applicable to your business, and disregard the fortune teller’s pronouncements. Search for the key questions instead . Your business might be similar to others in some ways, but it’s one-of-a-kind in others. Your company deserves first-principles thinking about the right way forward.

In 1983, Lorne Whitehead, a physicist from the University of British Columbia proved he could knock down the Empire State Building with 29 dominos . A domino can knock over an other domino one-and-a-half times its size. Whitehead’s theory concretely demonstrates the power of a chain reaction. Like a series of dominos, a startup’s success is a chain reaction. One small win leads to two other slightly bigger successes, which grow to four triumphs, then eight hits and so on until the company is a blockbuster. The first win might be witnessing a product capture the imagination of a random coffeedrinker at a local cafe. The second reaction might be closing the first paying customer. The third, hiring a top-notch executive. At each point in the chain reaction, there is some probability the reaction continues. The probability of discovering product/market fit early, of hiring a great technical team, finding the right initial reference customers. Many different factors influence those chances: the founding team, the product itself, the pitch, the competitive environment, the press, ability to raise capital. So that chain reaction is a series of chained probabilities. When thinking about a potential market opportunity, articulating the list of business model chained probabilities can be useful. In the case of a paid mobile game, it’s simple. The company is betting they can write a game that will differentiate itself sufficiently to entice one million people to buy it. Other business models assume multiple hypotheses. For instance, B2B freemium businesses, like Slack andExpensify, market a two step value proposition . In other words, two hypotheses underpin the business model. First, that company can build a product appealling enough to end users to attract millions of users. And second, that activity of those users combined with specific upsell features will convince a business to pay for a team, department or company-wide license. Marketplaces can be even more complex. In a marketplace like Beepi, the business first has to convince car owners to sell their cars with Beepi. Then they must convince buyers to trust the marketplace sufficiently to buy a car. Third, they must develop processes that scale so they can generate liquidity in the market place and a flywheel effect begins, acquiring buyers and sellers at attractive unit economics. Yet other businesses pursue wedge go-to-markets. Chris Dixon wrote about wedge business models in 2010. Wedge businesses sell an initial product to close a customer and then cross-sell products into those accounts to juice revenue per customer. Each new product is a new hypothesis, a chained probability. Chained probabilities aren’t independent. The first flickers of success increase the odds of the second probability, and so on. Success begets success. When startups have momentum, we’re saying the odds of their success, the odds that the conditional probabilities result in their favor is increasing. And that’s why seemingly small ideas, if they can muster momentum, can often turn out to be orders of magnitude larger than most expected.

My father keeps a copy of Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy on his bookshelf. An imposing dark gray tome, Competitive Strategy is a business classic. I remember reading it sometime in high school, and not understanding very much of it. It was only six years later in a college macroeconomics class, my professor helped me understand the value of the Five Forces. For startups entering a period of increased capital cost, the wisdom of Porter’s Five Forces is more important to consider now than they have been in the past few years. The Five Forces are: The Threat of New Entrants: How easy is it for new companies to pursue this market? What barriers to entry exist? The Threat of Substitutes: What switching costs exist to keep customers with one vendor? How differentiated are the existing products in the market? The Bargaining Power of Suppliers: How much leverage do the suppliers to an industry have?  how concentrated are they? This can be labor or components of the product the startup must source from third parties. The Bargaining Power of Buyers:  How much leverage to buyers have in an industry? How concentrated is the demand? The Intensity of Competition:  the greater the threat of new entrants, the greater the threat of substitutes the greater the bargaining power of suppliers and the greater the bargaining power of buyers, the more intense the competition. The past two years have been an era of growth at any cost. Damn the burn rate, full speed ahead. In this bull market, fundraising became a competitive advantage for startups.  After having raised a huge investment, a startup could crown itself the winner of a category. Able to hire more people, spend more to acquire leads and close more customers by sustaining a greater burn rate, these cash-flush startups grew faster than their competitors, attracting more investment and reinforcing their capital supremacy. As the cost of capital increases in 2016, these winner take all rounds will become less and less common.  So the disparity across competitors’ balance sheets will contract. Instead of competing on fundraising ability and absolute growth, startups will have to compete on more fundamental and enduring competitive barriers that manifest themselves in better unit economics. It’s not that fundraising will not remain a critical skill in 2016. Rather, fundraising will no longer be exclusively sufficient. Cue Porter’s Five Forces. The least competitive sectors, and consequently, the ones that will engender companies with the best unit economics, are the sectors in which buyers are clamouring for unique technologies and products that few others can replicate and can’t be found anywhere else. If you’re thinking about starting a new business, consider evaluating your ideas with Porter’s Five Forces and pursuing those ideas with enduring barriers to entry. In a more capital constrained startup ecosystem, your startup will have a structural competitive advantage.

Quick. Casual. Human. Chat differs from other forms of communication. Because of these three attributes, chat seems to be reemerging as a potentially disruptive user interface for both consumers and business users. The typical teenages emits more than 3000 text messages per month, not to mention messages on other networks. Most retailers provide customer support via chat. Hundreds of millions of people have tweeted. The combination of these three forces expose nearly everyone on the Internet to brief, useful messages every hour. It’s not that chat is new. Internet relay chat dates back to the earliest days of the Internet. But, the exciting advances promised by new startups extends much further than message exchanges between two people. These chats have consequences. Send a text message to book a flight. Post a note on Slack to provide peer feedback at work or file an expense. Wire $15 to a friend to cover last night’s beers. In many of these use cases, chats replace forms, the list of empty text boxes we must complete in order to accomplish almost anything on the Internet or mobile phone. In fact, most SaaS software today has two principal components: an input form and some analytics that aggregate those data across time. And who doesn’t sigh every time they login to Salesforce to enter a new customer? Imagine a user interface that asked about your day. Which customer did you meet today? How much budget do they have? What is their timeframe for buying? Questions, a fundamentally human construct, replace the lifeless, empty cells of a database recreated on a webpage. A question engages users the way another person would, even if the person asking the questions isn’t a person, but a robot. Machine learning and large data sets enable this advance in user interface. Given enough data and sufficient computational power, computer scientists can code bots that, at least for some fraction of the time, can replace humans asking questions. Intelligent, question-driven chat will become an important user interface for many different use cases, with a few characteristics in common. Frequent use, because chat requires learning a new user interface, and behavior change demands repetition. Brief and relatively simple interactions. Users won’t pen Powerpoint presentations in 140 character increments. Multi-platform applications that work just as well on the phone as on the laptop and tablet. Applications that benefit from a more casual interaction. Chat software startups will face several key challenges when coming to market. First, SaaS applications rebuilt as chat-only user interfaces must provide more than the current competing offerings to succeed. Second, if integrating with existing messaging platforms, these chat businesses will face platform risk. The platform company providing the messaging infrastructure may decide to pursue a particular use case themselves. Third, generating meaningul revenue per user with a smaller price anchor. How valuable is a user experience advancement to most software buyers? Unlike the Salesforce ecosystem in which buyers compare sales productivity tools to the $150 of a Salesforce seat, the prices in the messaging ecosystem are much smaller -  just a few dollar per month for Slack or Office 365 (which bundles Yammer). None of these are insurmoutable obstacles, just another set of considerations. There’s a wave of innovation looming with chat user interfaces powered by artificial intelligence (with human fallback), and we’re just at the start of it.

65% of entrepreneurs believe that fundraising in 2016 will be more difficult than in 2015, according to First Round’s survey. The volatility in the stock market, the steady erosion of public multiples, and the broad decline of seed, venture and growth investment in Q4 2015 seem to portend a repricing of the startup market. In light of those changing circumstances, entrepreneurs should prepare a few different analyses for 2016. First, the company should list the milestones they would like to achieve before raising the next round and a financial model that projects the capital requirements to attain those milestones. The SaaS fundraising market has become relatively efficient and good initial targets for raising Series A and Series B are roughly $100k and $250k in MRR, plus or minus $50k in MRR. Next, the company should develop a cash flow forecast to answer the question , Can the startup achieve those milestones with the cash on the balance sheet, plus a six month buffer to raise the next round? If the startup possesses sufficient capital to attain those milestones, the team should focus on attaining those milestones and raising capital opportunistically. If undercapitalized, the team should decide which to pursue: to raise capital now, raise capital later or become profitable on the cash available. When should a startup raise immediately? There are a few different scenarios when an immediate raise is a good idea. The inside investors are excited about the business and are willing to lead and price an inside round to bolster the balance sheet. Or the startup has good odds of raising capital now because the startup can still sell the dream, not the metrics. In other words, the founders can raise on the promise of success. Typically, such a company has a unique perspective , a remarkable team and large market opportunity to address. Last, the company is embarking on a long-term build and won’t have achieved an important milestone (product launch, paying customers) upon which to raise the next round. It may be worth trying to close a round sooner rather than later. When should a startup raise capital later? This is the riskiest option. Without a strong milestone to underpin a fundraising, the startup’s team is betting that either the market will rebound to a degree, some key milestone will fall ahead of plan, the startup’s target market will mature meaningfully in the next few monthls or the founders will be able to raise irrespective of the state of the business. When should a company aim for cash flow break-even? This is the most conservative option. Consider this option when your startup is already generating revenues substantial enough to support a team that can invest, improve and build the business. The goal is self-sustainability and steady, but slower growth. In contrast, a meager revenue stream that subsists a skeleton maintenance team won’t build long term business value. Each startups’ fundraising plan should reflect the uniqueness of the business’ circumstances: its strengths, weaknesses and plan. Re-evaluating this plan quarterly is also a good idea. Ultimately, this longer term planning should ensure your startup has the capital needed to thrive, regardless of the oscillations of the fundraising market.

Suppose you’ve been selected to participate in a game show. The game show host asks you to pick one of three doors. Behind one, the grand prize awaits. Behind the other two are goats. You choose Door 1. Then the hosts opens Door 3, revealing a goat. The host prompts you again, “Would you like to select Door 2?” Should you choose it? This statistics question rose to fame in 1990 when Marilyn Vos Savant asked it in Parade Magazine. In the weeks that followed, Vos Savant received more than 10,000 letters pronouncing her wrong. One thousand of these letters had been penned by PhDs, and many bore the insignia of prestigious universities . A professor of mathematics at Georgetown University wrote to Vos Savant, ”You are utterly incorrect. How many irate mathematicians are needed to get you to change your mind?" Another from George Mason University piled on, ““You blew it!… As a professional mathematician, I’m very concerned with the general public’s lack of mathematical skills. Please help by confessing your error and, in the future, being more careful.” Even Paul Erdős, the famed Hungarian mathematician, refused to believe it. To the chagrin of the ten thousand vehement and highly-educated contradictors, the result stands. Vindicated by computer simulation, Vos Savant exposed the often counter-intuitive nature of probability. There are many different ways to explain why selecting Door 2 will grant you a 67% chance of choosing the car. This is the simplest I’ve found.  When you choose Door 1, you have a 33% chance of winning the car (1 in 3 doors). You also have a 2/3 chance that the car is not behind Door 1. After the host reveals Door 3 hides a goat, there is still a 2/3 chance that the car is not behind Door 1. But now there is only one door, Door 2. So you have a 2/3 chance that the car is behind Door 2. The additional information that Door 3 contains a goat improves your chances and this can be proven using Bayes’ Theorem. But even after that explanation, the answer remains unintuitive. These confounding conclusions aren’t rare. K.C. Cole, a professor at USC explained our challenge in perceiving the relative sizes of quantities in an article entitled “ Why You Didn’t See It Coming. ” Both $1 million and $1 billion sound like “a lot,”… [But] even those who understand the true scale of the chasm between those numbers intellectually don’t always “get it” viscerally. It feels like the difference between a million and a billion is closer to a factor of three than a factor of 1,000. That’s because our brain naturally works using something like a logarithmic scale, so that it can condense information like vast ranges in loudness and brightness efficiently. That can get us into trouble… These blindspots confuse us. And when prompted with data that confounds our expectations, only 10% of the time will we trust the data rather than our intuition, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Decisive Actions: How Businesses Make Decisions report. 57% of the time, survey respondents would reanalyze the data to ensure no issue with data collection or math errors. Our ultimate goal with data is to defeat bias.  In the “Philosophy of Data,” New York Times Op-Ed columnist David Brooks articulates the two ways data exposes when our hunches are just plain wrong. First, it’s really good at exposing when our intuitive view of reality is wrong. For example, every person who plays basketball and nearly every person who watches it believes that players go through hot streaks, when they are in the groove, and cold streaks, when they are just not feeling it. But Thomas Gilovich, Amos Tversky and Robert Vallone found that a player who has made six consecutive foul shots has the same chance of making his seventh as if he had missed the previous six foul shots. Second, data can illuminate patterns of behavior we haven’t yet noticed. For example, I’ve always assumed that people who frequently use words like “I,” “me,” and “mine” are probably more egotistical than people who don’t. But as James Pennebaker of the University of Texas notes in his book, “The Secret Life of Pronouns,” when people are feeling confident, they are focused on the task at hand, not on themselves. High status, confident people use fewer “I” words, not more. More than simply explain what has occurred in the past and why, data is a powerful tool to expose our biases and point the way to the right decision, especially when the data contradicts our instincts. If 1000 PhDs can be fooled by a counterintuitive probability problem, no one is safe from bias.

2015 is the end of an era, the era of startup growth at any cost. In 2016, the question that will immediately follow, “What is your annual growth rate?” will be “What are your unit economics?” This change in investor mentality is catalyzed by the increasing cost of startup capital. Starting in 2014, and perhaps even a bit before, startups have been able to raise capital at better terms than at any time since 2000 . More money raised for less dilution. The greater competition among investors increases valuations relative to revenue pricing valuations further into the future. Inexpensive equity dollars enable capital-intensive companies to amass the warchest necessary to dethrone incumbents. To sustain these growth rates and reach the levels of market liquidity they have, startups like Uber and AirBnB require massive amounts of cash. Crunchbase tallies $10.1B raised by Uber and $2.4B by AirBnB. Just eight years from founding to dominance with an entirely new model: the largest taxi company in the world owns no taxis and the largest hotelier in the world owns no real estate. Equally important to note, real estate and transportation are two industries startups historically haven’t upheaved. To sustain these growth rates, startups like these require lots of cash because of the customer acquisition payback period, and the more tenuous ones need capital to prove the business model actually works at scale. A theoretical example: a business at $100M in revenue looking to grow 100% annually with a blended customer acquisition cost of $400 and a payback period of 9 months, and an average annual revenue per customer of $533, must spend $75M dollars per year - we’re ignoring churn. That’s a massive amount of capital even if after a year, all the users start generating cash for the business. The startup must have a a balance sheet of more than $100M to shoulder that type of annual marketing spend. And would might happen if the company didn’t spend all this capital? Market fragmentation. Imagine regional taxi services, 4 in the US, each with a different app, different labor pools, different terms. The aggregate value of those four services would be a tiny fraction of an Uber’s valuation. Centralization creates economies of scale, particularly in marketplace businesses that justify massive expansion to engender winner-take-all dynamics. The capital markets have boosted these types of startups, helping them raise huge amounts of capital at attractive prices, and disrupt massive markets. But over the next 5-10 years, the cost of startup capital will increase for three reasons. First, the Fed will continue to raise interest rates that are at historic lows. In 2008, the Fed Funds Rate sat at 5%. Today it’s between 0.25-0.5%. Second, the struggling stock market and the elevated prices in the private startup equity markets will entice the hedge funds, mutual funds and others away from the private markets. Combined, those non-traditional VCs account for about 25% of venture dollars invested last year, sapping the strength from the startup bull-market. Third, VCs will not continue to raise near-record amounts of money. With more than $50B raised last year compared to a 15 year median of $17B, it’s clear this allocation of capital will revert to the mean at some point. All of this points to less money available to startups. As demand falls, so will prices/valuations. When seed and Series A investors consider an investment in 2016, they will be asking themselves, “How much capital will this company need to raise before an exit?” and “How hard will it be?” Over time, raising money will become harder than it is today, increasing the risk for early stage investors that the startup won’t raise the capital it needs. So, the next question in the pitch conversation is: how quickly can the business show its unit economics work? Because at that point, the business only needs money to grow. The sooner those economics prove a viable business, the better the fundraising odds, even if the fundraising markets stiffen in response to the three forces above.

How have public SaaS companies fared in the public markets over the past few years? It’s been mixed. Over this three year period, 32 of 50 companies are worth more today than they were either at IPO or at their trading price three years ago. Of the remaining 18, 7 of those companies went public in 2015. It was a tough year for SaaS companies to go public. The chart above shows the stock performance across the three year period. Big winners include ProofPoint, LogMeIn, ServiceNow, Qualys and Fleetmatics. On the other end of the spectrum, Marin, Castlight, Jive and MobileIron have declined quite a bit. It’s not that these companies revenues aren’t growing and boosting the potential for a larger market cap. Rather public market investors value these companies at substantially lower multiples than in recent history. In 2014, investors paid a median enterprise value to forward revenue multiple of 7.7x for SaaS companies . Today, that number is 4.2x, a drop of 45% in two years. This deflation in forward multiples affects companies across the board, both the fast and slow growers. Looking at multiples by quartile, we can see the 75% multiple fetched in the public markets has fallen from 10.8x to 7.2 over the last 15 months. Similar drops have occured across the board. Typically, the faster growing companies obtain higher multiples. Will this broad deflation impact the private markets? Our internal analysis shows that the private markets value premium SaaS companies at 15x forward revenues on average, which was 2x the public median, but is now closer to 3.5x the public median. So, on average, we should expect startup forward multiples to decline some over time. If investors keep investing in startups at the rates in 2015, then prices should hold. On the other hand, if the initial data on the rate of fourth quarter investment is accurate, which some services have calculated as a 15-30% drop, then perhaps pricing will adust  sooner. The bellwhether will be premium companies. At 15x, the ratio is still 2x of the top quartile their public peers. Will investors continue to pay this mark despite the broad based correction in the public markets? I suspect in many cases they will. Returns from investment in startups are dominated by a power law, even in SaaS. There’s only one $50B SaaS company today. There are only 3 in the $10B range. The desire to get into the next category leader often overwhelms financial discipline, because if the startup becomes a $10B market cap company, then the multiple at the early rounds may not matter.

For all the talk about late stage rounds, megarounds and unicorns, early stage startups are benefitting disproportionately from near-record years of venture capital investment. Of the $42B invested in startups in 2015, 34% or about $14B was raised in series A and seed rounds. That figure is up from 18% in 2005. The 35% attained in 2013 share for early investment ties the 1996 record. Both an increase in the number of investments and the average amount raised by early stage companies has contributed to this trend. On average, 25% more early stage startups raise capital in the last five years compared to 1995-2000. And when they raise, they raise at near record amounts. The chart above shows the average dollars an early stage company raises adjusted for inflation. Today, we’re quite near the 2000 highs of $11.9M, at $10.4M. In Q1 2014, the market abruptly changed course from a steady decline of round sizes in the early stage market into a massive upswing. Perhaps the strong IPO year in 2013 enticed investors. Among the names going public that year: Tableau, Marketo, RocketFuel, FireEye, Twitter and Xoom. The Facebook IPO was also just a year old. As the dollars and volumes of deals have increased, so too has the shift to consumer companies. MoneyTree data shows B2B companies still command 75% of venture investment dollars across all stages. But consumer has been rising steadily to more than 25%, again a figure not seen since 2000. Consumer startups tend to have higher failure rates than their enterprise cousins, but their upside can be unbounded. Compare the largest SaaS company, Salesforce at $50B in market cap, to the largest consumer companies, Google and Facebook at roughly $500B and $275B market cap respectively, to prove the point. If we are starting to see a decline in the pace and amount of venture capital investment, I suspect we will see a reversion to the mean for the consumer/enterprise split favoring enterprise businesses. The secular shift toward B2C businesses won’t continue forever. As for changes in the early and late stage markets, the early stage market should remain relatively stable. Because VCs, both institutional seed investors and Series A investors, raise funds across 10 year periods, the bulk of the capital raised from LPs targeting the early stage market are already committed and will have to be deployed. The late stage market may witness a different phenomenon. More than 40% of the dollars invested in Series B and later rounds originating from corporate venture capital, mutual funds, hedge funds and family offices. This money isn’t committed to startup investing. Investment strategies for these types of investors can change quickly. If suddenly all that capital were to disappear and everything else were to remain the same, about $10B would leave the startup ecosystem - a drop of 25%. That would surely be felt across Startupland.

image credit: Manu Cornet In 1967, Harvard Business Review rejected a paper submitted by Mel Conway.  A year later, Conway’s thesis would be dubbed Conway’s Law. Conway graduated from Caltech with a Masters in physics and from Case Western Reserve with PhD in math. He worked on the Pascal compiler among other notable software projects. Over the course of his career, Conway observed a phenomenon. The products software teams created reflected their organizational structure. Let’s make that concept a bit more tangible. Nigel Bevan, a usability expert wrote, “Organizations often produce websites with the content and structure that mirrors the internal concerns of the organization rather than the needs of the website.” In other words, the marketing team has a webpage. The sales team has a webpage. The public relations team has a webpage. Rather than reflecting the realities of the customer journey, the internal structure of a company dictates its product architecture. Conway’s Law arises in software development projects. Put three front-end engineers on the same project and the user will have three different ways of accomplishing every task : point-and-click, keyboard shortcut, menu item. If you have two different heads of engineering within a company, there will likely be two different source control systems, two different code-checkin processes, two different architectures and so on. In 2008, Alan MacCormack and his co-authors researched and validated Conway’s Law in HBR by studying the software produced by companies and contrasting that with open source software produced by communities. I’m not sure the law is truly a law, that it is universally true. But it does raise the question of whether or not a startup’s teams are properly structured. For example, most fast-growing companies start off building a monolithic application (one app server, one database, one logic tier) and eventually migrate to a microservices architecture, where the functionality that used to be encapsulated within one codebase are fragmented into tens or hundreds of different services. One could argue this is a reflection of two forces: the growing size of the engineering team and the rise of devops where developers are responsible not only for coding but also quality assurance and operations. So, small teams of developers can become nearly fully independent of the larger engineering organization. Hence microservices. Unfortunately, Conway’s Law does not provide a diagnostic tool to help executive teams determine whether or not their organizations are properly structured, nor when a reorganization of a company might make sense. It only raises the question: Does our organizational structure lend itself to building the best product for our customer? And that is a very good question to ask periodically.

At its essence, a product is a combination of different funnels bringing the user from one state to another. How many funnels does your startup’s product have? How many are you measuring? How many are you optimizing? Uber’s consumer experience has two funnels. The first is user on boarding: registering a user and collecting their payment information. The second is booking transportation from opening the application to rating a driver’s performance. Slack has many more.  Onboarding users and the groups they belong to. Configuring administrative features like group owner. Integrating bots. Creating groups. Learning the / syntax for Slack commands. Joining additional domains. Creating profiles. Upgrade the account to paid. The list goes on. One of the key responsibilities of a product manager is developing these funnels, measuring them, and optimizing them. A friend working at a publicly traded software company framed product development this way. At his company, before product managers and their teams write a single line of code, they have already defined the conversion funnel and every possible state for user to be in. And, they set initial expectations for the conversion rate through each step. This discipline accomplishes a four goals. First, the product team must be comprehensive; they must understand and plan for all the different pathways a user will explore in the product. What happens if a user aborts the sign-up flow when asked for payment information? What happens if the user doesn’t appear for their UberX? Second, the product measures user performance from the outset. After all, the product is built, the engineering team knows precisely how to instrument it. It captures conversion funnel data from the very first user. Third, the documented expectations inform the team’s focus when optimizing the product, even if these initial expectations are guesses.   Most often when releasing a product, there are one or two different key problems in the conversion flow. When user data conversion rates deviate meaningfully from the team’s expected conversion rates, the team knows exactly which step in the process to reevaluate. Fourth, as teams optimize each funnel locally, these efforts combine to create product-wide improvements in user flow, satisfaction and, eventually, revenue. When a startup is small with just a few people working on product, teams tend to focus on just one funnel. But as the product grows in footprint and complexity in order to serve more the needs of the product,  incorporating these conversion funnels as part of product development lifecycles from definition to evaluation helps product teams to continuously improve their product.

In his book describing Google’s People Operations called Work Rules! , Laszlo Bock presents this chart to describe the difference between the way many companies think about talent today, as a normal or Gaussian distribution, and how Google thinks about it, as a power law. It’s the most provocative idea about employee compensation I’ve found. As Daniel Kahneman showed in Thinking Fast and Slow , humans think in normal distributions. Most people will near the mean and a few outliers exist at the best and worst end of the spectrum. But, that’s not the case at work. Quoting Bock: Human performance in organizations follows a power law distribution for most jobs. Herman Auginis and Ernest O’Boyle of Indiana University and the University of Iowa explained that quote instead of a massive group of average performers dominating… Through sheer numbers, a small group of elite performers [dominate] through massive performance." Most organizations undervalue and under reward their best people, without even knowing they are doing it. Today, it’s common for startups and companies of all sizes to refer to compensation surveys that span the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile in compensation for roles, and use these benchmarks provide offers to new hires, inform promotion salary increases and new option grants, and underpin retention packages. And for most of the company, this strategy works very well. But, this compensation strategy must be complemented with a plan to reward the exceptions, the 10xers. Initially, Google used the Founder’s Award, a  multimillion dollar stock grant awarded to an extraordinary project team. Founder’s Awards were presented annually to a handful of different teams. However, Founders’ Awards engendered their own set of issues. Employees were less happy after Founders’ Awards were granted. These grant raised questions like: Who should be included in the project team? How should the stock grant be allocated amongst the team? How can I achieve a Founder’s Award if my team can’t impact the company on the same scale as others (so is my work less meaningful)? These questions impinged morale. Founders’ Awards celebrated the financial success of the team, not company achievements. I remember a few ceremonies, and that’s exactly how I felt. So, Google experimented and determined that publicly shared experiential awards are far more satisfying than cash. These include trips to Hawaii, elegant dinners, new gadgets among other things. Employees felt a stronger emotional connection to the company, regarded the business as more thoughtful, and overall employee satisfaction increased. In addition to these public experiential rewards, Google still rewards top performers privately with financial rewards that follow a power law distribution. I’ve seen these types of rewards work well at startups, too. At one fast-growing startup, the founder rewarded the remarkable contributions of a young engineer with a beautiful motorcycle. The motorbike is a sincere gesture of thanks and recognition. When developing your startup’s compensation philosophy, consider whether you’d prefer to compensate your team based on a normal distribution or power law distribution.

Which of the 16 major start of categories in information technology will reap disproportionate share of investment dollars in 2016? And which sectors are closely guarded secrets shielded by seed investors, that may have their breakout year this year? Using Crunchbase data, I analyzed share of dollars commanded by each of these 16 categories over the last five years to understand the trends in both the seed and series A fundraising markets. The chart above contrasts the pace of investment across the two markets by sector measured by % of total dollars invested anually. Seed investment is marked blue, and series A investment is marked red. Advertising has seen its share of both series A and seed dollars fall from 15% to 5% in just five years, and indication of how out-of-favor this category of business has become amongst investors, because of the dominant network effects of Facebook and Google . Analytics remains an important category for both markets. Startups building analytics products command roughly 10% of both seed and series A dollars. Big Data, a term popularized in 2012 that has reached its apogee in 2015 according to Google trends increased from 2.5% of the market in 2010 to  more than 7.5% of the series A market in 2015. Seed investors’ interest in Big Data has remained constant over the last four years while series A investors’ appetite continues to grow. Cloud computing, which encompasses the infrastructure products used by developers to build services, has remained flat at 4% over the past five years despite some recent declines in 2013 and 2014. Amongst investors, Digital Media is witnessing a renaissance growing from 2% share to 4% share in three years. Series A investors,  though, have not shown has keen of an interest, or at least not yet. This may be a breakout category in 2016 for Series A investments. The challenge for digital media companies in the past has been the valuations at exit. Media companies trade at lower multiples than traditional software companies, but the impressive growth of new entrants like Upworthy may entice investors to reconsider. A perennially important category, e-commerce is constant in the series A market at 15%, but declining in the seed market, falling from 15% below 10% in 2015. E-commerce companies require more capital in order to grow, in part because the margin structure is lower than software companies, and these businesses require a fair amount of working capital. The decline in seed interest may indicate seed investors expect an increase in cost of capital in the next few years, and consequently the follow-on dollars to finance e-commerce startups may not be available at the attractive terms they once were. Since 2010, education startups have been on a tear in the seed market growing from 6% to now 10% in 2015. During the period, we two salient education companys have gone public: 2U, a SaaS online college company worth $1.3B and Instructure, a learning management system business worth $550M. Disclosure: Redpoint are investors in 2U. Seed investors continue to invest roughly 4% of their dollars, but series A investors have not followed over the past five years. FinTech, which includes startups in the Bitcoin ecosystem,  have seen good and bad years, with a whipsaw decline in 2014, in which the early winners of the movement benefited from a massive increase in follow-on rounds , but new companies were starved for capital, followed by a banner year in 2015. Games continues to suffer a steady decline from 7% of dollars to fewer than 2% of dollars. Exits in this category have been harder to come by than expected, with the exception of King.com. Meanwhile, high-flyers such as Angry Birds’ parent company Rovio haven’t been acquired or gone public, while facing increasing competition in the ecosystem and pressure to diversify their offerings. Hardware/software combinations, category that includes connected devices like Fitbit, crested in 2014 had more than 5% of series A dollars, before falling to under 4%. Despite  embracing combination hardware software companies at IPO, the public markets have not sustained high multiples for these businesses. GoPro lost 73% of its market cap in 2015 and FitBit is down 44% from its August 2015 high. Health and wellness  companies continue to receive increasing amounts of early-stage capital through 2014 before suffering a mild decline in 2015. The interest spiked around the ratification of Obamacare. Marketplaces have rocketed from a 2.5% share of seed dollars to now 10%, buoyed by the massive successes of Uber and AirBnB. Uber is the largest taxi company in the world by market cap, but doesn’t own any taxis and AirBnB is the largest hotelier in the world by market cap, but owns no real estate. The astronomical growth rate and size of these businesses have seen investors pursuing new and novel categories, meanwhile’s series A investors have remained steady at 5% of dollars. Given the amount of seed investor interest, I expect  many of these marketplaces to raise series A dollars in 2016. SaaS companies  following a similar trajectory to marketplaces, where seed investors are outpacing series A investment, but both are increasing their allocations from 5% to 15% and 10% respectively. The opportunity here, as readers of this blog will know, is still quite large, with less than 2% of traditional software market capitalizations having transitioned to SaaS, including the private company cohorts. Security is the one category where series A investors invest substantially more than their seed counterparts. Series A investors allocate roughly 4 to 6% of their dollars each year to security companies, while Seed investors spend less than 1% in this category. If the persistent drumbeat of breaches and data leaks are any indication, we should expect more investment in security. Precipitated by Facebook’s dominance in the category, setting aside a few outliers including Snapchat,  social media investment has fallen from 15% to 5% across early-stage investors. This drop is highly correlated to the advertising implosion. Both businesses are intricately intertwined; social media businesses generate proprietary data assets that are used to create unassailable advertising platforms. Because of the increasing network effects Facebook imposes on both ecosystems, investors historically have perceived less and less opportunity in both of these categories. In conclusion, big data, education, marketplaces, and SaaS should see strong investment activity in 2016. Advertising, games, and social media will likely see similar years to 2015 unless there is a discontinuity in those markets. Perhaps digital media and fashion companies will break out from the seed investment market into the series A market. And it remains to be seen whether or not seed investors will follow their series A counterparts into security investments.

When I was at Google, we worked with a user experience team frequently to help us design changes to the AdWords front end. After having reviewed our designs within our product team for weeks, we often thought the design was complete and foolproof. But we were consistently proven wrong by the UX team whose work surfaced face-slapping oversights. At UserOnboarding , Samuel Hulick has taken this approach with more than 40 different on-the-mark and a bit irreverent UX critiques of many top internet and mobile services. Reading through the breakdowns reminded me of those UX sessions at Google and reaffirms the insight a fresh pair of eyes can offer when looking at a product. Samuel’s critiques also surface the positive practices of products like Slack which provides concise descriptions of each step, and clear calls to action. Great design is opinionated design on the right assumptions to make and while we all may disagree on the best affordances to make for users, Samuel’s body of work provides one consistent view across many products to compare and contrast different approaches. Most importantly, these breakdowns demonstrate the power of user experience research to catch the issues in product flow, user communication and clarity that can materially impact user conversion rates through funnels. UserOnboard is a rich library of on-boarding approaches that should be in the library for product managers and designers everywhere.

The fundraising markets have infused more cash into startups in 2015 than in any year since 2001. But, the venture backed IPO markets touched five year lows and whispers of a bubble have become a meme in the past six months. What’s really going on? And should that impact when founders start companies? No one can time the financial markets. If you can, you should be trading stocks, bonds and options and retiring very soon. The financial markets will rise and fall, and shouldn’t factor heavily into when a founder decides to start a business. One founder I admire greatly left Google to start a business only after he saw the signs the public financial markets had soured. He rationalized he would have a much easier time recruiting the best talent. In addition, the turbulence in the stock market would keep risk averse candidates from clogging his recruiting pipeline. Only people in love with an idea or with startups would take startup risk as Lehman imploded. When potential founders ask me the right time to start a company, I remember his advice to me. The best time to start a company is when you have a unique perpective on a market, you have developed a strong network of people who can form your founding team, and you can convince a few of these friends that the idea is worth pursuing. These people form the kernel around which the company will crystallize. If you can’t hire a great team, there’s a problem. The idea may not be well refined enough or bold enough. You may not yet be able to sell yourself or the vision well enough to convince someone to take the risk. You may not yet have developed your network of people passionate and skilled in your startup’s area. Investors will always chase great teams pursuing unique ideas. That is a constant, despite the vacillations of the financial markets. The best time to start a company is when you can nucleate a team around yourself and your vision.

As a startup scales and surpasses its first organizational breaking point of 8 employees, it’s time to start thinking about organizational design. The strategy a startup chooses in their market should determine their organizational design. In the First Round Review profile of Paul Arnold , the Head of Operations at AppDirect, Paul shares the challenges the initial organizational structure created as the company grew 5x in less than a year. We started building our teams with a simple functional structure: product managers working as a product team, account managers working as an account team, and so forth for engineering, sales, marketing, customer support, QA, and partnerships. But we hit a wall quickly… Companies can be organized in many different ways that cluster into three themes determined by reporting structure. In functional organizations, product managers report to product management directors, who report to product managment VPs and then to the CEO. Apple is functionally organized. Product or Division based organizations appoint a leader of a particular product and everyone who works on that product, regardless of team, reports to the general manager.  GE and Cisco are organized this way to manage their vast product portfolios. Last, matrixed organizations ask employees to report to both a functional manager and a product general manager. Google is a good example. Most startups begin as functional organizations, grouped by engineering, product, marketing and sales. As the startup grows, it might move into either a product organization because the company would like the scale the number of products or into a matrixed organization. There are benefits and drawbacks to both to consider when thinking about your startup’s org chart. But organizational design doesn’t stop at structure. In the 1980s, Jay Galbraith developed the Galbraith Star , and simultaneously, McKinsey published the 7S Framework . Both frameworks outline the components, in addition to structure, necessary to create vibrant companies. Galbraith’s Star enumerates five components: structure, strategy, people, reward systems, and internal network design. McKinsey’s 7S adds style and company goals to the mix. All of these ideas influence the other. A change in strategy requires new talent, new reward systems and new company goals. People spans recruiting, training and development. The company must decide the skills and the values of the people they need to be successful.
Reward Systems involve compensation structures like bonus and option programs, in addition to recognition like the Google Founder’s Award .
Internal network design involves designing the way people in the company will collaborate, communicate and make decisions. How does data flow through an organization? Whose decision is required to start or stop a project? There isn’t anything prescriptive in these frameworks. Rather, these frameworks ensure teams consider all the different components of organizational design when deciding to restructure their companies as they grow. Remember to consider these other important factors as you evolve your startup’s organizational design.

Last week, I was chatting with an old friend who after I told her how busy and ragged I sometimes felt, she asked me, “Are you present?” To which I immediately replied, “At work?” And she laughed, and said, “I meant at home, but I have my answer!” The conversation reminded me of a man at Google named Chade-Meng Tan. In Building 42 of the Mountain View Campus, which is the main building in the center of the headquarters, there used to be a poster on the wall of Chade-Meng with many world leaders including several presidents and the Dalai Lama among others. Chade-Meng distinguished himself by developing a mindfulness class at Google that has become massively oversubscribed with an endless waiting list. The demand for his class proves two things. First Chade-Meng is a wonderful teacher. Second, many of us are searching for calmness and mindfulness. The end of a year is a good time to reflect on being present. Chade-Meng has a wonderful video with an opening Buddhist parable about emotions: A man rides on a horse, when he comes along a peasant. The peasant asks the rider, “Rider, where are you going?” And the rider says, “I don’t know. Ask the horse.” I hope to be more mindful in 2016.

The Ultimate Software Company is a $5.5B market cap provider of SaaS Human Capital Management software. Founded in 1996, the company initially sold licensed software and migrated to multi-tenant SaaS in 2002 with a product called UltiPro. Today, more than 82% of revenues are subscription dollars. The company serves the mid-market and enterprise customers with a broad software suite that includes Payroll, Human Resources Management Software (HRIS), Benefits Management, Time Clock and a Self Service Portal for employees. In addition, Ultimate Software sells a business intelligence product licensed from IBM Cognos. At roughly 2800 customers as of November 2015 and $583M in trailing twelve months’ revenue, Ultimate Software generates about $210k in average revenue per customer, which implies reveune skews toward the enterprise part of the market. The company’s financials are available for 20 years and show the progression of a company with $4M in revenue to more than $583M. Over that time period, the business has grown 28% per year on average, steadily becoming one of the largest SaaS companies in the world. Among publicly traded Human Capital Management software vendors, Ultimate Software is second to Workday. Since 2004, Ultimate Software has generated positive cash flow. The business went public in 1998 forecasting cash flow breakeven within two years. Ultimate Software ran mostly unprofitably through 2005, and has a strong history of operating with positive profits for the last 6 years. The median publicly traded SaaS company operates with 71% gross margins. ULTI has averaged about 60% of late. This figure is depressed by professional services revenue which represents about 20% of revenue and is run at 0% gross margin. However, professional services’ contribution to revenue has fallen from 32% in 2010 to about 20%, likely because ULTI is moving into the mid-market and the product has improved so less service is required to satisfy customer needs. This decline in professional services revenue as a fraction of total revenue has boosted overall margin. Ultimate Software spends about 25% of revenue on sales and marketing which is half of the publicly traded median of software companies, and they are growing at roughly the same rate as companies of their age - about 23% annually. The company’s sales efficiency has varied quite a bit over the past twenty years, but has exceeded 1.0 only once - during the year of the IPO. On average, the company generates about $0.44 of gross margin per sales and marketing dollar invested. In part, the relatively lower gross margin contributes to this figure. In addition, the presumably long sales cycles to win F500 contracts for this critical piece of software weigh some, too. Ultimate Software is right on the median for engineering spend at 16% of revenue. The Ultimate Software Company - name notwithstanding - is a great example of an enduring software company that has thrived for over 20 years with steady growth driven by disciplined investments into growth and product.

SaaS Enabled Marketplaces employ elegant business models. They are verticalized SaaS companies that manage a marketplace to create winner-take-all market dynamics. SEMs can generate revenue in four ways: charge the buyer and/or supplier a software fee & charge the buyer and/or supplier a marketplace fee. In addition, a startup must determine what rake to charge. At Redpoint, we’ve invested in more than 15 marketplaces and have evaluated dozens more, including more than 20 SEMs in the past year. Some of these are Free SEMs . So which type of pricing should SEMs pursue? These are the questions we use internally to hypothesize the best pricing models for SEMs. SEM or FSEM? Does the sector lend itself to freemium software distribution? When should a startup remove the toll to access the marketplace? We recommend startups choose freemium strategies when they meet the following conditions. The potential users must number in the millions . The conversion rates of freemium product rarely top more than 5%, so the universe of users must be quite large to generate substantial revenue. The initial software user differs from the buyer. Free software becomes an education tool and lead generation to a second value proposition . The target user is difficult to acquire through traditional sales and marketing techniques because the unit economics aren’t profitable. The company possesses enough capital to sustain its development despite a long latency between product release and revenue. The company can generate meaningful transaction revenue (see transaction characteristics). There are important competitive considerations that compel the company to win as much marketshare as quickly as possible. SEMs should ask themselves the first three questions for both the supplier and the customer to develop a point of view on each. Transaction characteristics There are three dimensions that describe a transaction in a market place: frequency, transaction value, and supplier variability. Customers who frequently buy high value items from many different suppliers benefit the most from market places. Founders often consider the first and second. But, supplier variability is equally important. If a customer varies little in suppliers, then the SEM should charge a substantial software subscription fee in addition to a one-time marketplace fee. In this scenario, both the customer and the supplier may use the marketplace to find each other (lead generation). But the initial introduct, the supplier and customer often negotiate a long-term business contract outside the marketplace to reduce costs - a concept we call breakage. In such case, the marketplace cannot capture the ongoing value of the relationship between the buyer and seller through transaction fees alone. To maximize revenue, the startup should favor charging a substantial subscription fee for the software in addition to a fee on the first transaction. Frequency and transaction value are often inversely correlated. From our research most SEMs charge between 5-15% of gross merchandise sales in rake. Among consumer marketplaces , there is quite a wide dispersion on rakes, which might foreshadow similar variance in the SEM world. Also, these fees tend to be higher when the marketplace manages the payments rather than providing leads. Total Addressable Market Market places either shrink their market or expand the market. Marketplaces shrink the market when the total number of transactions remains constant, but the fee revenue in the sector compresses because the marketplace eliminates middlemen costs and so depresses total revenues. Other times, marketplaces increase the demand for a product by reducing friction, and new customers enter the market. An SEM’s pricing model should reflect the founder’s thesis on market size expansion or contraction. The more an SEM will compress a market, the greater the importance of software revenue, and the less attractive the FSEM option becomes. SEMs should consider giving software away for free when they can generate substantial revenues from the marketplace alone with little breakage risk, without compressing the addressable market radically, and when the free distribution engenders a strong competitive advantage.

After a startup attains product market fit and begins to exceed the first breaking point of the startup management structure around 10 employees, it’s time to codify the company’s values. The values of the company are the most concrete way for a business to determine whether candidates might make good employees. At two separate SaaS Office Hours recently, we heard similar stories from Maia at Greenhouse and Pete at Optimizely. At both Optimizely and Greenhouse, one member of the management team began the values definition process as the company began to scale. First, the lead solicited feedback from current employees about what they liked and didn’t like about working at their startup  either by interviews or surveys. Then, the lead condensed these into an initial set of values reviewed by the management team. Next, the management team presented them to the employees, and began an iteration and refinement process until everyone was satisfied that the values written down truly reflected the way employees felt about the company. Last, the values began an integral component of the interview process for new people. At Google, we called these values Googliness. Other companies employ witty acronyms and other mnemonics, but all of them consider the cultural fit a critical element in hiring people. These values determine where in the Performance/Culture 2x2 matrix depicted above. As Maia told us, companies should only hire candidates that fit in the upper right quadrant, that are both high performers and strong cultural fits. And hiring managers often hire the wrong person when they compromise on either one of these attributes, as tempting as it may be in this competitive talent market. Behavioral interview questions test values best. If your startup prizes customer-centricity, ask candidates, “Tell me about a time when you went out of your way to help a customer?” And after they’ve responded, follow up with, “Now tell me about a second time.” Candidates who truly do embody customer-centricity shouldn’t be challenged by these questions, and the cultural fit will become clear. This type of structured interview should test for the values the company has enumerated together, and will ensure a more consistent hiring success rate and better candidate fit.

Last night, SaaS Office Hours at Redpoint welcomed Maia Josebachvilli , the VP of People and Strategy of Greenhouse. Maia is a thought leader in human resources. Specifically, she champions a metrics-based approach for developing world class recruiting teams. Because of her position, Maia has observed recruiting patterns in hundreds of companies, and has developed best practices for startups. Maia reports these five strategic recruiting metrics to the executive team each quarter. These metrics resemble the diagnostics sales teams use to understand their funnel, and provide similar visibility into the efforts and successes of the team. Qualified Candidates/QCs - the equivalent of a sales qualified lead, the QC is a leading indicator of whether the team will attain its hiring goals for the quarter. A QC is defined as a phone interview that qualifies a candidate as a good fit for a requisition. By understanding the QC to accepted offer rate over time, a company can forecast the odds of attaining the hiring goal that quarter, just as sales teams estimate bookings. Days to Close - speed is a competitive advantage in recruiting because the most sought after candidates will have many options. Greenhouse and many other top recruiting companies maintain less than 30 day latency between first contact and signed offer. Candidate Satisfaction - after every interview, Greenhouse sends a survey to interviewers to gauge their satisfaction with the process including how well the position was explained, how well prepared the interviewers were, whether they felt respected and treated courteously. Startups should aim for 70% or better. Offer Acceptance Rate - what fraction of people who receive offers accept them? This figure should be quite high, 75% or greater in some cases. If the offer acceptance rate is low, the recruiting team should investigate. Some causes include lower candidate satisfaction, a slower days to close, unclear hiring parameters in the job requisition, and miscommunication between recruiting and hiring managers. Hires to Goal -  the total number of new hires divided by the goal. A company that isn’t achieving its hires-to-goal number should understand the bottleneck, whether in sourcing, evaluation or close. A well structured kickoff meeting between the recruiter and the hiring manager is a fundamental requisite to success across all these metrics. In that meeting, the hiring manager and recruiter should define two things. First, the 30 day goals of the role, from which a recruiter will distill the key skills required in the job. For example, a data engineering role may require familiarity with data analysis tools. Second, the long-term objectives of the job, which will reveal the attributes and values of the person. The same data analysis job would require an ability to learn new technologies and simplify complex data into comprehensible insights for the rest of a team. After that conversation, the recruiting team can qualify candidates properly, describe the role, move candidates through the process quickly and prepare themselves to surpass their goals. These five strategic metrics form a simple scorecard to help a startup’s management team evaluate the health of the company’s recruiting efforts each quarter. Consider using them in your startup.

Just 25 months ago, Aileen Lee coined the term unicorn in her post Welcome to the Unicorn Club and last week the Economist declared these Unicorns “ Gored .” Over the span of those two years, the Unicorn press cycle has swung from euphoric apotheosis to bleak nadir. The rise and fall of unicorns in the press isn’t a unique phenomenon. A company’s narrative moves like a clock: it starts at midnight, ticking off the hours. The tone and sentiment about how a business is doing move from positive (sunrise, midday) to negative (dusk, darkness). And often the story returns to midnight, rebirth and a new day… wrote Aaron Zamost , a former manager of global communications at Google, YouTube and currently head of communications at Square wrote about the press cycle .  The truth of the matter for unicorns lies somewhere in between the night and the day. We don’t often talk about what success means for this class of companies. So what is it? For the founders and employees, it’s not just the attainment of a $1B valuation. Success is a combination of financial gain, work experience in a hyper-growth company, and the pride of building a transformational company. Many of these companies will attain all of those things. We can argue about the degree of financial gain for each one, but because unicorns are broadly distributed across consumer and enterprise sectors, and within subsectors like transportation, security, sales software, it’s irrational to argue that all of them will fail. There are many spectacular and disruptive businesses in the herd. If we evaluate these companies as a portfolio, as investors do, then unicorn success is measured by financial return. Early stage VCs who have invested in a portfolio of different unicorn companies will likely generate terrific returns. At a blended valuation of $100M post-money, a Series A investor in a $1B company at IPO or sale records a 10x gain. Later stage investors like mutual funds and hedge funds, simply have to break-even on their investments to perform similar to the S&P500, a common benchmark, which is up just 1.65% for the year. There will be flameouts. There always are with startups at any stage. Our fascination with unicorns today has to do with the scale of the phenomenon: the number of companies at these valuations, the amount of capital fueling their growth and the historic cash burn required to attain those growth rates - and the perceived risk with such high stakes. And it’s true that the boom-time fundraising market of the last few years has created some problems. The Economist enumerates three, which all are legitimate: the desire to reach $1B in valuation for marketing/ego, the multiple disparity between the public and private fundraising markets, and an environment that is less discerning which businesses have strong business models and which have business models susceptible to changes in the fundraising climate. But we’re arriving at the point when the gloomy sentiment around these companies is unwarranted. Perhaps the mark-to-market accounting by mutual funds of recent investments is to blame. But that news may be deceptive, because the valuation methodology and true financial performance isn’t known to the public. As the press tide turns, let’s not forget these companies all aim to transform some industry segment and grow at historic rates. Many will succeed. Some will not. But in the end, many of these companies will have transformed the world according to their mission. The negative press cycle is just another hurdle to overcome. To quote Teddy Roosevelt: It’s not the critic who counts; the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena .

In 2015, startups benefitted from a vibrant fund raising market. In 2016, I believe they will enjoy a very active acquisition environment. The roughly 60 or so publicly traded software companies hold more than $380B in cash and short term investments on their balance sheets. Though Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle possess 75% of that cash, 14 other companies have cash reserves of greater than $500M. If we examine the M&A activity measured by number of acquisitions announced through November 28, 2015 across the largest 18 businesses, we can see Google and Microsoft have become increasingly acquisitive over the past few years, with Microsoft setting nearly doubling the number of acquisitions since Satya Nadella took the helm as CEO. In addition, newer entrants like Workday and LinkedIn are beginning to enter the fray as their businesses continue to grow, their product scope expands and they accumulate cash. Meanwhile, Oracle and SAP’s activity has waned. These older businesses acquired substantial businesses in the past and have historically consummated the largest transactions, including SAP buying Concur for $8.3B, Oracle buying Responsys for $1.7B, among others . Salesforce also pursued a more measured acquisition pace, and dropped to fewer than 10 acquisitions in 2015 to date, less than half of last year. This could be because of the dramatic increase in private SaaS valuations in 2015. If there are to be massive acquisitions of software companies in 2016, this list of roughly 20 companies are likely to be buyer. Their significant cash positions and substantial market caps enable them to swallow a $1B acquisitions. Newer  companies, like Splunk, Service Now, and Tableau, each with market caps of greater than $7B and more than $500M in cash have the capacity to acquire startups for multi-hundreds of millions. Netsuite, also with a market cap of about $7B has $372M in cash, and is also another acquirer to watch. With substantial amounts of cash in their coffers and some very large market caps, there are more than 20 software companies of note who could be quite active in the startup acquisition market in 2016.

It’s the end of the year, time for performance reviews, self-reflection, and planning for next year. In addition to preparing our goals for our teams and our businesses, we should prepare goals for ourselves. Oftentimes, it’s easy to let the company’s ambitions drive our OKRs. But there’s something more to consider. In 1999, Peter Drucker, the greatest management thinker of the twentieth century, wrote short book called Managing Oneself . In it, he stresses a critical idea: There is no return to the old answer of doing what you are told or assigned to do. Knowledge workers in particular have to learn to ask a question that has not been asked before: What should my contribution be? To answer it, they must address three distinct elements: What does the situation require? Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, what results have to be achieved to make a difference? The last two questions are the most important: how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And what results have to be achieved to make a difference? At the intersection of those two concepts lies a plan for an exceptional year. Before leaping into 2016, take some time to reflect on how to make the greatest contribution by aligning your strengths, your values and the needs of your team. And use those insights to craft goals for next year.

On December 2, SaaS Office Hours at Redpoint will welcome Maia Josebachvilli , VP of Strategy and People at Greenhouse, a fast growing recruiting software company. Before Greenhouse, Maia founded Urban Escapes, a DC-based startup she sold to LivingSocial. Maia is especially well known for her thought leadership in developing best in class recruiting metrics. She was also selected for Inc’s 30 under 30. As we learned at SaaS Office Hours with Pete Koomen, after a startup is found product market fit, the company’s most important initiative is building the machine that builds the machine. Maia has developed a series of different strategic and tactical metrics for talent acquisition to help startups develop terrific recruiting funnels and optimize their processes for growing as quickly as possible. One of Maia’s key principles is measuring the recruiting process like a sales funnel. Phone calls, conversion rates through the funnel and candidate satisfaction through the process feature highly in her metrics.  Because of Maia’s unique vantage point point working for a fast-growing applicant tracking system company, she has seen the recruiting practices of hundreds of companies. At SaaS office hours, she’ll share the best practices she’s learned with us. A quick note about SaaS Office Hours: these events are in person, so please register only if you are certain you can attend on the evening of December 2 between 5 and 7. Our goal is to create an intimate environment for founders and executives to network and learn from the SaaS world’s leading experts in different fields. We’ll continue to experiment with the program over time. If you have feedback, suggestions or ideas, please email me using the link on the top right of this page.

Last night, SaaS Office Hours hosted Optimizely co-founder and CTO Pete Koomen . Pete was a Google Associate Product Manager for AdSense and launched Google App Engine. Then he joined his co-founder, Dan Siroker, also an APM at Google to found three companies, the last of which is Optimizely. As Pete shared with us, the idea of Optimizely was borne from a need Dan saw when managing the teams to build Obama’s fundraising websites during his first campaign. Dan and his team wrote code to fine-tune sign-up flows, and the experiments meaningfully improved fundraising performance. During YCombinator, after Pete and Dan had been accepted with a different ecommerce idea, that the two founders jettisoned the first idea and instead pursued the website optimization concept. Famously, they tested the idea by calling two advertising agencies and asking them to pay $1000 a month for early access to a product that didn’t yet exist (but soon would). Now 400 people strong, Optimizely is the leader in A/B Testing. The conversation at the Redpoint office in San Francisco last night focused on the insights Pete accumulated during the early days of the company. These were some of the things I learned from Pete. First, hire a management coach to work with you as the company grows. As Optimizely evolved, the demands on Dan and Pete increased enormously. Pete told us that being a leader is a never-ending journey of improvement. The best ways he found to learn leadership skills was to hire a management coach to meet him once per month, to talk through the issues facing him at Optimizely. In addition, the management coach performed 360 degree reviews for Pete to help him understand how his team wanted him to evolve to maximize his impact on the company. Second, you must fire yourself way before you think you do. As soon as you become good at a job - sales, product, marketing - you know enough to hire the person to replace you. And you should do it right then. It’s the only way to scale the business. When that person starts, you have to stand back and let the new employee learn the job, making the mistakes they need to make to become great at it. As a founder of a business, Pete told us, that’s an incredibly hard exercise in letting go. Third, hire for hustle in sales, especially at the beginning of the company when the sales process and sales motions aren’t defined. Optimizely’s first successful salesperson had previously started a mattress-recycling company in Seattle. Optimizely’s second salesperson had retired from professional ballet-dancing. Though these two key contributors possessed atypical sales backgrounds, they shared a fire, a determination that fueled their success in discovering the right go-to-market strategy for the company. Last, after your startup finds product market fit, hiring becomes the top priority of the business. Pete said - and I loved this expression - “You have to build the machine that will build the machine.” In early 2012, Dan and Pete gathered the company at the beginning of the year to say that 2012 would be the year of hiring and that everyone’s first priority is building a great team. Pete asked every employee to share their likes and dislikes of working at Optimizely and used that to enumerate the companies values, which became the rubric that measured candidates and determined which would become Optinauts - Optimizely employees. Pete is an inspirational leader who is remarkably genuine about the successes and struggles of building a category defining company. Thank you, Pete, for sharing some of these insights and stories!

In 76 years, the British cycling team have recorded only one gold medal. In 2002, pushed by new head coach named Sir Dave Brailsford, the team implemented philosophy of continuous incremental improvement . And the results were astounding. In the last two Summer Olympics, the British cycling team has won seven of a possible 10 gold medals at each event, a remarkable transformation. But, it wasn’t a 1% improvement on any arbitrary metric. Rather, the team identified the top factors performance, and focused on single-digit improvements in those.  There were three: strategy, human performance, and continuous improvement. and the team spent years refining strategy unique to each race, optimizing the diet and training of each athlete, and experimenting, experimenting, experimenting. I’m not sure the three core focuses of the British Cycling team translate to startups. But I’m quite certain the notion of incremental improvement is a common ingredient for great success. If the software as a service model has taught us anything, it is the power of compounding returns. We certainly see the effect of compounding in the impact of customer success on a business, and content marketing . And I can tell you from an investor’s point of view, that a little advantage at the outset of the company can mean a world of difference when it comes to raising capital to grow your business. What’s more, the evolution of traditional marketing into growth hacking is evidence at the best customer acquisition efforts are those which pursue experimentation in the name of consistent, incremental improvement. In my experience the very best companies are the most disciplined ones who consistently create experiments to test their ideas, and pursue constant incremental improvement. We did this constantly at Google and over time, the advertising technology we built, and the search technology other teams built became incredibly dominant because of the relentless focus on improvement. It takes a certain kind of mania to focus relentlessly on incremental improvements. And while in the day-to-day combat, can be easy to lose perspective on the overall impact that a few basis points of improvement and a quarter might make, as the British cycling team proved, the summation of all those pennies in the end yields incredible outcomes.

As the temperament of the fundraising market shifts, particularly in the later stages, the question of how much a startup should burn will become increasingly important. We’re living in a historic period of very inexpensive venture capital. These cheap dollars have fueled spectacular companies with record-setting growth rates. In such an environment, growth at almost any cost is handsomely rewarded. But we’re observing the ecosystem starting a correction - particularly in the late stage of the market. And so burn rates will matter more and efficient growth will be prized again. What does that mean for founders when planning their 2016 budgets? After all, everyone building a company wants the business to grow as quickly as possible. But that doesn’t mean spending all the cash reserves in the next sixth months. Here’s a top-down way of thinking about the maximum amount of burn a startup should sustain. It’s a useful exercise when paired with a bottoms-up financial plan starting with leads, sales reps, bookings and cash collections. When determining how much cash your startup can reasonably burn, it’s important to plan for a multiple correction.  Today, the early and growth stage SaaS market prices companies on a forward revenue multiple. This is a public market investment term meaning the value of the company is equal to some number multiplied by the sum of the next twelve months of revenue. The top quartile public SaaS companies trade at about 7.5x forward revenues. The top 3 - Xero, ServiceNow, Workday trade at about 10.5x forward. The best companies in the private markets fetch roughly 15x forward, or twice the public top quartile. Multiple is a function of many things including growth rate, market attractiveness, team qualification, margins and other considerations. The chart above shows a hypothetical SaaS startup’s valuation evolution from Seed to Series A to Series B. Let’s suppose the company projected $2M in forward revenue at the A and $5M at the Series B.  There are two valuation cases: The first case in blue shows the company raising at 15x forward revenues at Series A and Series B. The case in green shows the impact to valuation if a halving of the forward multiple to 8x were to occur in between the Series A and Series B. In the blue case, the valuation of the business balloons from $30M to $75M. The company likely raises about $15-20M in the Series B, and everything is roses. In the green case, the valuation of the business increases modestly from $30M to $40M. The company likely raises $10M, which means that the value of the business, net of the new cash, hasn’t change despite a 250% growth in revenue. This is certainly not the outcome the founders might have expected. The goal of this exercise is to determine exactly how far into the future the business must be in order to raise money at an increased valuation relative to the last round if multiples halve - and whether or not the company currently has enough cash to finance its operations through to that period plus enough time for fundraising. If the cash position of the company isn’t strong enough, it’s time to cut burn and/or raise more money. Now, let me say a few things about this framework. First, I can’t say when or if this multiple correction will ever happen. Second, I can’t promise that if multiples were to fall, they would be at 8x forward - they might be higher or lower. Third, forward multiples are much more common in the Series B and later rounds, and less common in Series A and Seed so earlier stage companies may not have been priced this way in the past, but they will be as they progress. Now, let’s transition from the theory to the observed data. The chart above shows the median burn rate of publicly traded SaaS companies by year. It’s called cash from operations on their financial statements. By year two, the companies are burning about $4M per year, which ramps to $10M from years 3-5 and then decreases as the company scales revenue to about break even. There’s a huge variance in the data, but I think the median is an accurate representation of what I’ve seen in the market today. When determining how much cash your startup should spend, perform a bottom-up financial plan and a top-down analysis like the one above to ensure your startup is always in a position to raise capital at a more attractive valuation than the previous round.

Founded in 2002, the Australian software maker Atlassian is an exceptional company in many regards. But foremost, Atlassian is one of the best examples of flywheel SaaS companies yet. Atlassian counts 1600 employees and sells five products JIRA (bug tracking software), Confluence (project management), HipChat (internal chat/collaboration), BitBucket (code repository) and JIRA Service Desk (help desk software. Yesterday, Atlassian filed their F-1 , a document preceding their IPO, and revealed how efficient a software company they have built. In 2015, the company will generate $320M in revenue. The chart above details the revenue growth of the business compared to the median of the 50+ publicly traded SaaS companies. It follows a beautiful geometric curve characteristic of Flywheel business models, where an efficient customer acquisition engine keeps building momentum and growing revenues exceptionally. Note only the last 3 years of revenue are found in the F-1. The rest of the data points I gathered from press about Atlassian. Atlassian’s average customer generates revenue of $5594 per year, which places it among companies like Zendesk, LogMeIn, ConstantContact and Xero in the smallest quartile. Atlassian has grown their customer base from 11,000 customers in 2010 to more than 48,000 today. Though Atlassian counts more than half of the Fortune 500 as customers, no single customer accounts for more than 1% of revenue. In other words, no single client pays Atlassian more than $3.5M. And only 864 customers pay more than $50k per year. Perhaps the most impressive part of Atlassian’s business is their go-to-market efficiency. While the median SaaS company spends between 50-100% of their annual revenue on sales and marketing, Atlassian has spent between 12 and 21% of their revenue on customer acquisition in the last three years. These metrics are simply unheard of. They also imply a sales efficiency, normally in the 0.8-1.2 range of 2.5 to 3.2. The data makes clear that Atlassian employs a fundamentally different go-to-market than the classic sales development rep to inside sales model championed by books like Predictable Revenue and popularized by Salesforce. This flywheel model uses the product and analytics to attract customers and upgrade them into higher paying tiers. As a consequence of immense sales efficiency, Atlassian is profitable - a rarity in today’s software companies. Atlassian’s net income as a percentage of revenue has been positive the last three years: 7.2%, 8.8% and 2.1%. In addition, Atlassian generates cash flow of between 15-18% of revenue. This cash, in addition to a small amount of venture capital, has provided the wherewithal to fuel the business’s growth. In 2015, Atlassian will generate more than $65M in free cash flow. Atlassian operates at 83.4% gross margin, 12 percentage points above the SaaS median of 70.9%. Atlassian spends aggressively in research and development, investing more than 40% of revenues of late into improving their products, optimizing the funnels which fuels the growth of the flywheel model. Atlassian surpassed the $50M revenue mark seven years after founding, in 2009, similar to Hubspot, DemandWare, NewRelic and other great companies. Compared to the typical SaaS company, Atlassian has growth at roughly the median growth rate over the past 8 years. Forward Revenue Multiple Enterprise Value, $B 7.7x $3.6 9.0x $4.2 10.5x $4.8 11.5x $5.3 What will Atlassian be worth in the public markets? If we project the company to grow at 45% in 2016, a similar growth rate to 2015, then revenues will total about $460M. Atlassian should command a premium multiple. 7.7x forward revenues is the top quartile median implying a $3.6B market cap. Workday and ServiceNow trade at 10.5x. And Xero trades at 11.5x, which is the best forward multiple as of Friday, which would imply a valuation of $5.3B. If nothing else, Atlassian is existence proof an exceptional business can come from anywhere . It’s a unique flywheel business with best-in-class sales efficiency. Every SaaS founder should study this business to understand the model. It’s a case study in sales efficiency.

In the last 22 months, there have been 4 $1B+ software IPOs and 3 $1B+ software acquisitions. But compared to 2014, 2015 was a meager year for startups looking to go public or be acquired. The chart above plots the M&A activity over this period. The M&A market halved in activity. In 2014, $11B of disclosed M&A occurred. I’m excluding take-private transactions of public companies like SAP/Concur, Bain/BlueCoat, Oracle/Responsys, etc. Through November 1st 2015, transaction values dipped 40% to  $6.8B. The number of transactions has also nearly half from 38 to 17. However, in 2015 the median acquisition was worth $410M, compared to $193M in 2014, indicating that buyers are not buying as frequently, but when they are, they spend more. In 2015, the IPO Market stalled. 13 software companies went public last year raising $1.6B, an average of $105M per company. So far in 2015, only Xactly has gone public raising $56M. Looking at the data in another way, at the beginning of 2014, the enterprise value of all publicly traded SaaS companies totaled $151B. As of Friday, that same basket of companies is worth $176B. And all the companies that have gone public in the last 23 months are worth $13.7B or about 7.7%.  During the same period, forward revenue multiples, the primary metric used in public markets to value software companies, has fallen from 8.1x to 5.3x. Why was the exit activity in 2015 starkly different than 2014?  It’s not that the quality software companies has declined, nor have growth rates of software startups dwindled. Rather,  startups are finding the private financing markets far more attractive than the public ones. In the private markets, software companies can raise capital at 10 to 15x forward revenues,  a premium of 200% over the public markets. The difference in public and private valuations is only exacerbated by huge  increase in the growth capital markets, pushing private valuations up, and the downward pressure on multiples facing publicly traded software companies. These opposing force have increased the relative prices of software startups, undoubtedly contributing to the substantial decline in acquisition activity. What does this mean for 2016?  I suspect a major trend is the private markets will slowly come back into line with the public markets, paying similar forward multiples for companies. This will catalyze a wave of acquisition because for the last 18 months or so, the opposing forces of increasing private valuations and decreasing public valuations have made start up acquisitions substantially more expensive. In the next 18 months, the converse will be true and cash-rich acquirers who have been looking to bolster their product lines and develop new areas for growth will  perceive startups as far more attractive acquisitions at more reasonable prices. And the IPO market will reward those companies with exceptional growth and relatively modest burn rates.  Growth rate is still the number one correlating factor to forward multiple for software companies, anti-correlation has increased over the last two quarters from 0.3 to 0.43, indicating public market investors are just as hungry for growth as ever with one caveat. A path to short term profitability will be much more important in 2016 than before. I do want to note that the public markets have been very receptive to SaaS companies. In the same period, the median SaaS IPO has increased 17%  from its IPO price, and is on average above 35% from its last round post-money valuation. And with the number of superfast growing, capital efficient software companies in the private market, I expect 2016 to be  healthy year for software IPOs and exits - much better than 2015.

On November 18, SaaS Office Hours at Redpoint will welcome Pete Koomen, Co-Founder and CTO of Optimizely, the incredibly fast growing AB testing and personalization company Pete founded with Dan Siroker. Numbering more than 400 people, Optimizely has built an amazing business since 2009, serving  thousands of customers. Before Optimizely, Pete was a product manager at Google building Google App Engine which grew to support 150,000 developers. Before App Engine, Pete worked in the AdSense team and managed the OKR process at Google. Pete will share stories about his journey from a product manager at Google to building CarrotSticks, a children’s educational software company, to creating one of the fastest growing SaaS companies - and the learning and challenges he faced along the way. Famously, Dan and Pete used vaporware to test the idea of Optimizely before building it. In addition, we’ll talk about consumerization of IT , the fundamental shift in purchasing power from CIOs to line managers, and how to leverage this shift when developing your SaaS startup’s go-to-market strategy. Last, we’ll discuss how best to manage and measure a product team and how to structure the relationship with engineering leads. It it sure to be a great session. A quick note about SaaS Office Hours: these events are in person, so please register only if you are certain you can attend on the evening of November 18. Our goal is to create an intimate environment for founders and executives to network and learn from the SaaS world’s leading experts in different fields. We’ll continue to experiment with the program over time. If you have feedback, suggestions or ideas, please email me using the link on the top right of this page. Image Credit: Ryan Young

Last night, SaaS Office Hours hosted go-to-market guru Kenny van Zant. Kenny is a serial entrepreneur started his career as founder and COO at BroadJump,  a broadband software company that grew to $100M in bookings. He was awarded the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2002. After BroadJump, Kenny built the go to market organization at Solarwinds, a $4B market cap infrastructure software company, and Asana, a fast-growing productivity company, both of which exemplify a unique go-to-market approach, Flywheel Model, brilliantly. As Kenny told us last night, that experience of selling enterprise software quarter by quarter pushed him to  develop and discover businesses that have flywheel effect, that generate revenue even on weekends when no one is working because there is a huge amount of momentum in the customer acquisition strategies. Like flywheels in engines which capture energy and release it to deliver consistent output even when power isn’t consistent, Flywheel Business Models deliver consistent and accelerating customer acquisition  even when salespeople and marketers aren’t working. These are three of the key points Kenny made last night during our wide-ranging conversation. Freemium is a great go to market strategy , but only if the business meets several characteristics. First, the company has to be a product driven company not a sales driven company. Second, the number of potential users must number in the millions because the conversion rates for freemium businesses are often in the single-digit percentages. To be able to generate meaningful revenue, the addressable market size must be quite large. Third,  the time to value for user should be on the longer side. Freemium products benefit from very long trial periods, and use mechanisms aside from time limits to convert users into paid. fourth, the initial user is not the ultimate buyer of the software. Providing software for free to users maximizes distribution and increases the odds of closing the ultimate purchaser. Last, the company must be well-capitalized because flywheel business models require patience and time to achieve exponential growth. Friction in a sales process is useful. Friction can be a terrific tool to help prequalify customers. In traditional sales-driven SaaS models, sales development teams and account executives perform this function. In flywheel models, the product and on-boarding flows must do this. Friction forces potential customers to jump through a few hoops in order to use the product. Those users with strong initial intent, and ultimately good product market fit, will push through some friction at the outset. Users whose intent isn’t strong enough to overcome the friction probably work great customers anyway and would have become customer support/success headaches. At each stage in a startup, it’s important to figure out exactly the characteristics of the  total universe of customers that are addressable by a product, and focus exclusively on those.  most out of slots with minimum viable products, and so will be able to address only 5 to 10% of the addressable market with that minimum viable product. Over time, as the product team enriches the offering, more and more of the market becomes addressable. But at each step, there should be friction to ensure that the right customer segments are the ones prequalifying themselves into the product. Match pricing complexity with the sophistication of your buyer. How many pricing plans should a product have? Some companies adopt simple pricing plans with three or four alternatives, and highlight the most popular. Other companies offer super complex, highly customizable price plans.  For example, startups selling software to marketers, who are pressed for time offer simple pricing plans. On your hand, startups selling to IT operations teams, who are technical, and sophisticated buyers of many different types of technology, and who manage custom environments can go to market with far more sophisticated pricing plans. Heroku’s marketplace is a great example of this. Each engineer can choose precisely the size, sophistication and number of databases required for each project. There are few people who have built and advised as many flywheel businesses is Kenny, and who have the go to market sophistication he does. A huge thanks to Kenny for sharing his insights last night. Thank you, Kenny!

What is the optimal quick ratio for your SaaS startup? Is it 4? Quick Ratio = (New MRR + Expansion MRR) /  (Churned MRR + Contraction MRR) The quick ratio measures a SaaS company’s growth efficiency. The formula for quick ratio is above. It’s the new monthly recurring revenue (MRR) in a month plus the expansion MRR divided by the sum of the churned MRR and the contraction MRR. Churned MRR are customers who have not renewed contracts and contractions are those customers who have decreased their payments. Larger quick ratios are better. A startup without churn will achieve an infinite quick ratio.  But using startup benchmark data, what should be the right quick ratio? We can re-form the quick ratio to be stated this way: Quick Ratio = (Monthly Growth Rate + Churn Rate) /  Churn Rate And if we aim to have a quick ratio of 4, this implies that a SaaS startup growing at 15% can sustain a monthly customer contraction & churn rate of 5.0% per month, or 46% annually. At 20% monthly growth rate, a company can record 6.7% monthly churn and still attain a quick ratio of 4. Monthly Growth Rate 10% 15% 20% Monthly Churn Possible 3.3% 5.0% 6.7% Annual Revenue Loss 33% 46% 56% This churn number is unsustainably high, and we know from previous churn analyses that high churn implies lower growth rates and dramatically less efficient growth . According to Clement Vouillon’s great compendium of SaaS churn rate studies , the Totango survey shows 73% of SaaS companies have an annualized churn of 0-15%.  So looking at the Quick Ratios using this 7% and 15% annually, we see the quick ratios are much larger. Monthly Growth Rate /Monthly Churn 10% 15% 20% 0.6% 17.7 26.0 34.3 1.2% 8.7 12.5 16.4 In fact, they range from 8.7 to 34.3. As Clement notes in his analysis, these churn rates are probably more indicative of mid-market price points ($15k+ ACVs) and SaaS startups serving smaller customers will observe higher churn rates. Greater Quick Ratios are always better. It’s important to be mindful of the underlying churn rates in a business when evaluating your company based on its Quick Ratio. High growth rates can mask high dollar churn rates. Thanks to Mamoon Hamid, the creator of the Quick Ratio, for helping me with this analysis.

Last week, a friend asked me what I thought the future of software would be.  At some point, all the workflow processes that still conducted on paper and pencil will be digitized, all of the tasks completed in Excel will be optimized, and the majority of limitations of traditional software will be overcome. It’s not to say that software innovation in its current form will continue to exist for decades, but what is the fundamental shift that resets the ecosystem like the cloud did in  the early 2000s? For as long as they have been around, computers have only understood a handful of languages. But they have never really comprehended spoken English. They have never seen a photograph and recognized it as El Capitan. Or gotten the drift of an email from one coworker to another. As one entrepreneur described to me, the most powerful tool most computer users employ is Microsoft Word, but the computer has no idea what the human is typing in that document. Contrast that with engineers,  who speak computer languages, and can orchestrate thousands of machines working seamlessly together in order to crawl the Internet, target an advertisement, or prioritize the best lead for salesperson to call by writing code in a language the computer understands. I think it’s semantic understanding.  We have seen the very first threads of this in products like Wolfram Alpha.  You can type in a query that asks, “ Giants wins away games versus the Cowboys ” and Wolfram Alpha will understand immediately that you are asking about the New York Giants (American football team), not the San Francisco Giants (baseball team). You’re asking about games that are played  outside of New York, and against another football team called the Dallas Cowboys. And you’re probably asking this about the teams in the modern era because before 1926, the Cowboys were based in Kansas City.  You can try all kinds of odd queries like quote what is the mass of the moon multiplied by the height of a blue whale? There is an incredible amount technology behind this. The product of that technology is a magical experience. In this case, the computer understands all the context and nuances associated with a question without it having to be provided. That is semantic understanding. Imagine mobile app that listens to your phone calls and automatically update the Salesforce record. Or a CRM that reads your emails, reminds you about your customer’s wedding anniversary and prompts you to send a note. Or a calendar that automatically reschedules meetings depending on the changing priorities in your day and your physical location. In all these cases, the computer uses contextual understanding to act. These products, and many many more, are not so far away. In fact, we have bits and pieces of these experiences already in products like Google Now, RelateIQ, Infer. But that’s just the beginning.

Quota attainment is an incredibly powerful diagnostic tool when understanding  your SaaS startup’s go-to-market health. Quota attainment measures both the success of individual account executives and the performance of the team. To achieve best-in-class quota attainment, a startup must execute the go-to-market strategy well across five dimensions. First, the startup must supply the sales team with a growing volume of high quality leads. SaaS companies generate leads in many ways including through sales development reps, search engine marketing, paid social, lead capture on the home page, events, customer referrals, evangelists and channel partners. Consistently growing qualified leads is essential to quota attainment. Second, the startup must ramp sales people quickly. As SaaS companies scale, most companies begin to hire aggressively in sales. In the early days, a SaaS startup might have one or two sales people. Then they begin to hire one per quarter, then one per month. Pretty quickly the company is hiring 12 to 16 reps per quarter. Sales hiring process and sales training become essential tools for success when hiring this many people to ensure each account executive’s success. New account executives must be trained, learn the business, understand the sales motions, acquire techniques to handle customer objections, and absorb the parlance of the industry and company. In addition, fast ramp up periods imply sales people begin to book business earlier, which reduces the company’s burn. Imagine a hypothetical SaaS company hiring 8 AEs per quarter. If the account executives aren’t trained well, and they require 9 months to become productive (ie, book business), then the company is paying 24 account executives salary, none of whom are generating revenue. Fast ramp cycles also help sales managers understand which account executives are a good fit, and which aren’t. Third, quota attainment relies on efficient sales cycles. Setting aside industry specific considerations, longer sales cycles indicate a lack of product market fit and/or an immature sales playbook. Longer sales cycles indicate the sales team is challenged to generate immediacy in the sales process. In contrast, short sales cycles carry many advantages including faster improvement of the sales playbook, more efficient growth of the company, and simpler financial planning. Fourth, close rate, the percentage of qualified leads that ultimately convert into customers, is a lagging indicator of the SDR team’s effectiveness, and whether leads are being properly qualified before filling a sales person’s hopper. Last, the average contract value of a customer reflects the strengths of a company’s positioning in the market and the quality of the product.  Bill Macaitis would say the delta of the company’s NPS vs its competition. Quota attainment success is a composite go-to-market metric that when decomposed reveals where a SaaS startup’s go-to-market strategy is strong and where it needs work.

Taxis. Food. Cars. Mobile phones. Communications. Banking. Healthcare. Entertainment. In the past ten years, is there an industry startups haven’t upheaved? Startups have been the most transformational force in US society over the past 20 years. Uber has transformed the taxi industry, reducing taxi rides in yellow cabs in San Francisco by 65% in 2 years . Hampton Creek has created an eggless mayonnaise that terrified the US egg industry . Android is arguably the most widely distributed consumer software in history. WhatsApp delivers 50% more messages than all global SMS volumes . As banks stopped lending after 2008, market place lenders like LendingClub and Prosper bloomed and originated $12B of loans in 2014 . OneMedical and DoctorsOnDemand have transformed medical experiences for tens of thousands of people. Finally, YouTube and Spotify and Pandora are shifting the media consumption patterns. More than 20% of US homes in 2015 will have cut the cord - and stopped paying for cable TV service. These particular changes to industries sum to a huge macroeconomic impact. Two professors at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business have quantified the impact of startups on the US economy , and in particular on the public markets. 43% of US stocks are venture backed. They represent 57% of US market cap and employ 38% of the public company workforce. A handful of founders with a dream and a little bit of capital can change the world. And these teams are pushing society forward with greater magnitude, greater frequency, and broader impact than ever before. This data is reminder to set aside today’s concerns about short term undulations in the startup market, and reflect on the accomplishments and the broader benefits startups have brought to society. And wonder at what new invention we’ll see that’s waiting for us around the corner.

Last week, I interviewed Tien Tzuo, the former CMO & CSO at Salesforce, and founder/CEO of Zuora. During our conversation, he spoke about one of the major challenges facing fast growing startups. He called it recognizing the breaking points of management. At the founding a startup, the structure of the company is flat. Everyone is effectively a peer. At about 8 people, a leader must emerge to shepherd the growing team, and so the first management layer is created. Then again, somewhere around 60 employees, the company must add another management layer, and then again when the company reaches a few hundred employees.  Marco Zappacosta, founder and CEO of Thumbtack told me once, “As CEO, I changed from a contributor, to a manager, to a manager of managers, to a manager of manager of managers. And each time, I needed to learn again what it meant to be CEO.” Curiously, this pattern is consistent across companies. When startups approach those employee counts, communication within the company breaks down and the startup can’t effectively coordinate its people. The telltale signs include confusion in the organization, uncoordinated efforts across teams and frustrated employees. There’s theory underpinning why startups consistently feel these growing pains at roughly the same sizes. Henry Fayol a French mining engineer used empirical data observed in coal mines to prove the notion of span of control. . Span of control is the number of subordinates a person manages. As the number of reports increases linearly, the number of relationships a manager must oversee grows exponentially. Most companies design teams with a span of control of 7 . At Google, I was part of the team that calculated span of control across product, engineering and other teams. And though there were substantial variances depending on the needs of the team, the median was roughly 7. The diagram above depicts the number of management layers, the number of employees managed by each layer and the total number of employees assuming 7 span of control. In fact, another researcher, V.A. Graicunas developed a formula to describe this phenomenon which considers three types of relationships. First, manager to report. Second, report to report. Third, manager to subsets of reports. Relationships to Manage = n(2^(n-1) + n-1); n = # of reports As the table below shows, the theoretical complexity increases massively with each subsequent hire. Reports Relationships to Manage 2 6 3 18 4 44 5 100 6 222 7 490 8 1080 9 2376 10 5210 While adding management layers to a startup may not seem like the best way to manage, and some companies like Zappos have tried to maintain a flat despite growing to hundreds of employees, there’s a substantial body of empirical evidence and research supporting the notion that fast growing companies need to develop management layers to manage their employees and develop them best, and that these ranges are roughly consistent across companies. When building your startup, keep these rough employee ranges in mind as pivotal points to consider adding another management layer to the company and re-establish a harmony within the growing team.

On November 4, SaaS Office Hours at Redpoint will welcome Kenny van Zant ,  former COO of Asana and Chief Product Strategist at Solarwinds, a $4.1B market cap maker of infrastructure software. Kenny is renowned for pioneering the flywheel sales model that propelled Solarwinds to a $150M company profitably. Unlike traditional sales models, the flywheel sales model requires sales people to close business only from existing users. No outbound prospecting allowed. This requirement unifies the go-to-market efforts of companies, and spins a customer acquisition flywheel faster and faster to achieve terrifically efficient growth. Flywheel business models are still rare and not well understood, but when executed well, they create lasting, defensible and hugely valuable businesses. If you’re interested to know more about how to build these bottoms-up businesses, please register at the SaaS Office Hours page. And a quick note about SaaS Office Hours. Due to overwhelming demand for our session with Bill Macaitis, CMO of Slack, we’re transitioning the sign ups into a wait list. About a week before the event, we’ll send emails to roughly 30-40 people confirming their spots. Our goal is to create an intimate environment for founders and executives to network and learn from the SaaS world’s leading experts in different fields. We’ll continue to experiment with the program over time. If you have feedback, suggestions or ideas, please email me using the link on the top right of this page.

Last night, at our inaugural event, SaaS Office Hours welcomed Bill Macaitis , CMO of Slack, former CMO of Zendesk and former SVP of Online Marketing and Operations at Salesforce. Having worked in three hypergrowth companies, Bill is an expert in building massively successful marketing teams. These are the five kernels of wisdom I learned last night. When is the right time to hire a head of marketing? The right time to hire a head of marketing for your startup is when the company has found product market fit. Marketing amplifies a message, but rarely do marketing teams ignite the fire. Which marketing disciplines should the marketing team build first? After a startup hires a head of marketing, the operations and analytics team should be the first of the nine marketing disciplines to hire. After all, in order to understand which marketing techniques work, a startup must be well instrumented to measure variances across experiments. Next,  the marketing team should begin experimenting with paid acquisition, understanding the relationship between paid customers and organic traction, and whether they are linked. Which marketing metrics are most important? One metric that most SaaS marketers don’t measure frequently, but should, is Net Promoter Score . NPS measures the likelihood of customers to recommend the product. Best in class companies achieve a score of 70 on a scale of 100, but according to Zendesk data, the typical B2B software company achieves only 29. NPS is a leading indicator of future growth. The larger the number of advocates for product, the lower the customer acquisition costs for the company, and the more effective customer success team will be. How does a startup determine its price? Bill shared a unique point of view on this question. The price  a software startup can charge is a function of the difference in net promoter score between that startup and its competition. In other words, a startup with a very high promoter score compared to the competition can charge a premium in the market and vice versa. High promoter scores indicate great product market fit, good customer relationships, and substantial value creation, all of which translate into pricing power When if ever should we verticalize our marketing message? Often, horizontal SaaS products like Salesforce, which serve customers across many different industries, are tempted to verticalize their marketing message. In other words, to create marketing materials, websites, white papers and other collateral that are focused on the specific industry. While conceptually this makes sense, marketing complexity explodes. Instead of having one message to disseminate, a marketing team now must manage 5 to 10 different messages for each of the  verticals they seek to address. While this can be done, it requires us very large marketing team. For startups, it’s often much more effective to focus on the common attributes of customers and market based on those. Needless to say, Bill shared some terrifically useful and tactical insights with us. Thank you, Bill! At the next SaaS Office hours, we’ll welcome Kenny van Zant , former COO of Asana and SVP at Solarwinds to talk about flywheel business models. Stay tuned for more details.

How much should your startup pay its sales people? According to Pacific Crest’s Annual SaaS survey , 9% of a sales rep’s annual contract value. This figure doesn’t vary much on whether your startup’s salespeople are inside reps or outside/field sales reps. The table below computes the effective salary + commission of a sales reps as a function of average contract value and an estimated quota. The quota is an estimate based on deal velocity, how many deals a salesperson must close each year to attain quota. ACV 25k 50k 100k 250k 500k ARR Quota 600k 700k 800k 900k 1M Deals to Attain Quota 24 14 8 3.6 2 Annual Commission at 9% of ACV 54k 63k 72k 81k 90k Total Annual Comp (50/50) 108k 126k 144k 162k 216k Let’s walk through it. The first row shows the annual contract value (ACV), followed by an estimated quota. Dividing the quota by the ACV yields the number of deals closed per year. This is a sanity check to make sure that sales reps don’t have an unreasonable number of expected customers to find. It’s rare to see salespeople consistently close more than 2 deals per month (unless the company has exceptional product/market fit). Note, we’re not discounting these figures by quota attainment figures which is typically 80% purely to simplify the calculations. Next, we calculate the annual commission at 9% of ACV and assume that commission is 50% of total compensation - so we double the commission to figure the take home pay, excluding benefits, of a salesperson attaining quota. Why is there such consistency across companies in the 9% figure? It has to do with ensuring the salesperson’s efforts which are to generate revenue for the business more than adequately cover their costs and the costs of the rest of the company. If we assume the 9% is only half of the total compensation, then the sales rep truly costs about 18% for take-home pay, adding 15k for benefits per year likely increases that figure to more than 20%. The remaining 80% must cover the marketing spend, customer success team and sales development costs - in other words the fundamental unit plus product and engineering costs. When planning your startup’s sales commission plan for next year, consider using these benchmarks.

In 1964, IBM announced a mainframe computer family called the System 360 . The mainframe wouldn’t ship for another three years, but the announcement reduced the mainframe sales of their competitor , Control Data Corporation, sufficiently to warrant an FBI investigation. And so a new marketing technique was born. To be clear, there are many different forms of vaporware. Coined in the early 80s by Esther Dyson to describe software companies preannouncing a product, the term vaporware can refer to three different types of these announcements. There’s IBM’s practice of pre-announcing a product with the intent to gain competitive advantage, which violates antitrust law. Second, vaporware also refers to products that were announced but never shipped like the iPhone predecessor, Apple’s Wizzy Active Lifestyle Telephone or WALT. . Last and most useful, vaporware is software that’s pre-announced to gauge customer demand. In the consumer hardware world, vaporware has a different name: crowdfunding. Every Kickstarter and Indiegogo project are vaporware. A team creates a project page with a pitch and a request for money. The product, movie, album or comic book won’t be completed for quite some time.  But this type of marketing serves as terrific demand generation. Vaporware can also be used as a product discovery tool. Sendwithus, an email automation company, describes how they validated their SaaS product without building it . They aimed to “gather information about what a great product might look like.” And the founders created Sendwithus Zero, a $28 experiment that collected data on the features customers valued the most - which informed the product roadmap when it was time to build the product. The founders of Optimizely, Dan Siroker and Pete Koomen, used this same idea to determine the best idea to pursue after deciding to pivot from their education company, CarrotSticks. Dan and Pete sold two $1000 licenses to customers based on a landing page. Not restricted to products as a whole, vaporware can also be used to inform individual features. Nick Kishfy writes about using this technique in live products by creating a new button in a mobile app that he calls the Button to Nowhere. By measuring how many users explore the feature, a team can proxy the demand. There can be downsides to employing vaporware as a market research tactic. Some Sendwithus users expressed their dissatisfaction at having been unknowing participants in an experiment. In the Button to Nowhere experiment, Nick recommends telling users they’ve discovered an experimental feature to mitigate some of this risk. When used properly, vaporware can be a terrific product discovery, product validation and demand generation technique.

The purpose of a price is to tax usage of a product. That’s how companies generate revenue. Discovering how to tax a product properly is a perpetual challenge. It’s a moving target and so it requires an ongoing discovery process as the company and market evolve together. These are some mistakes I’ve noticed. Complex or unintuitive pricing model. A good pricing model appears simple and logical to the customer. It may be complex behind the scenes, with different prices for varying customer sizes, product complexity and add ons, but the tax align itself to the customer’s perception of ROI clearly. Customers have their own unit of measure. Often for applications, it’s people - hence a pricing model by seats. Other times for infrastructure, it’s bytes for storage or cycles for compute. But mixing these models by charging for a people-based product in units like bytes.  A pricing model for Slack that charged based on the number of bytes sent by the team in a month works conceptually, but is intangible, hard to understand, and also impossible to predict the ultimate cost for the buyer. Move to annual prepay too late. Salesforce popularized the annual prepay idea, and for good reason. Annual prepay generates cash flow to accelerate growth . Customers effectively lend the startup money to grow. It can be intimidating to push a customer toward annual prepay, or to demand it from an account executive, especially when a startup is young and the product immature. But it’s worth pushing as early as possible. Your startup will grow faster and need less capital to grow. Employ static pricing. The optimal price for a subscription product is the one that maximizes the revenue on the supply/demand curve. But unlike the charts my Economics professor drew on the blackboard, startup price demand curves aren’t static. They change with time. In fact, the marketing team exists to improve the demand curve by building a brand, developing reference customers, building strong return on investment case studies, building the lead funnel. As a startup becomes better known, the demand for the product increases, lifting the price demand curve, and with it the optimal price point. These effects can be dramatic. For example, Box’s revenue has grown from a few hundred to a few million dollars per year. Fail to embed concessions in the proposal. When selling to mid-market companies who buy software with purchase orders, not credit cards, startups will need to survive the procurement gauntlet. Procurement teams are often compensated on their success negotiating lower prices from vendors. Structuring proposals with this in mind is key to achieving the ultimate price target for your product. Using the wrong price discovery questions. When asking a customer or potential customer, how much they are willing to pay for a product, the customer will almost never be forthright. And for good reason - it’s against their economic interest to reveal their maximum willingness to pay. It’s much easier to ask a customer to think about relative price . How much is the customer willing to pay compared to another product? In the sales SaaS world, buyers think of the cost of new tools as a function of the cost of a Salesforce seat. 10-20% of a Salesforce seat for a productivity tool seems reasonable. But is this new lead generation product equally as valuable as Salesforce? Pricing is a moving target and found should view it as an ongoing product discovery process. Pricing should be re-evaluated regularly. Monthly at the very beginning stages of commercialization and then less frequently as the company approaches a the local maximum when a product matures and the company establishes itself as a leader. Beware of the pitfalls above and you’ll reach that optimal pricing mechanism faster.

Over the weekend, it seemed to me that the sentiment in the valley seemed to change abruptly. Dan Primack wrote Fear and Sadness in Silicon Valley , and Danielle Morrill punctuated her post Somewhere Over the Brainbow: The Unicorn Window is Closing images of unicorn cannibalism. While the attitudes may be changing, the effects haven’t yet revealed themselves in the data. So, is the environment truly changing? The number of megarounds, investments of greater than $40M in US companies, continues to surpass last year’s figures. 2015 demarcated in red in the chart above, notched more than 40 megarounds in July. In fact, there was only one month in 2015 that saw fewer megarounds than 2014 - the month of April. In terms of aggregate dollars invested, 2015 is on pace to be another record-setting year. In this case, two months in 2015 are smaller than their counterparts in 2014. Most notably, investors invested $5.3B in July 2015 compared to $6.7B in July 2014. Part of this delta may be due to companies in 2015 delaying their fundraising announcement for strategic reasons. Or it may be an early harbinger of a slowing market. On the other hand August 2015 exceeded August 2014 by $1.1B. In aggregate, then, it’s close to a wash. through August of each Year Rounds $Bs invested 2010 55 5.3 2011 82 9.8 2012 87 7.2 2013 103 8.3 2014 191 24.0 2015 246 28.4 If we examine the data through August of each year, in order to minimize the effect of delayed financings, we observe that 2015 is setting the high-water mark for number of rounds and dollars invested. We’re in an unusual time. The stock market is easily perturbed, while the private fundraising market booms, and has for more than five years. Startups are growing faster than ever before , but the mentions of layoffs at several high profile tech companies suggests some businesses’ economics may not be as favorable as once perceived, and has the potential to rattle an unwavering confidence in growth. Private market multiples are twice those in the public markets, yet startup IPO and M&A activity in 2015 has halved from 2014. With all these forces in tension, we will see many conflicting data points and opinions - and it can be easy to lose perspective in the maelstrom. The most important things to do as a founder now are the five essential tasks that must be completed no matter the environment : think long term, manage the company’s cash well by planning for the future, hire great people, mitigate customer churn by building great products, and raise capital opportunistically. And let the data sort itself out.

In sales processes, showing a product is always better than talking about a product. Better still is co-customizing the product with the customer during the sales pitch. This customization could be as simple as integrations or changing colors. There’s no better way for customers to understand a product, imagine how it would fit their needs, and become committed to the purchase than customizing their instance during the sales process. I’ve watched this brilliant sales tactic fuel tremendous growth at Looker , a fast growing analytics company. At Looker, we call this technique co-development. Co-development has accelerated sales processes and maximized customer success. Here’s how it works. Each Looker instance must be configured to connect to a database, be informed of the data schema, and map the customer’s key metrics. As early as the first sales meeting with a prospective customer, Looker schedules a 60 minute call with a data analyst. During those 60 minutes, they co-develop these mappings and metrics. Within the first five or ten minutes, the data analyst sees her data in Looker and quite tangibly understands the power of the product. As the meeting continues, the data analyst will continue to learn and manipulate Looker, so that by the end of the hour, she will have the first version of a customized Looker for her business. There are three reasons co-customization accelerates sales cycles and mitigates churn risk. First, co-customization provides instant gratification by minimizing the time to utility. . With co-development at Looker, customers visualize their own metrics, presented with all the nuances of the business known to the data analyst in the first hour of the sales pitch. The buyer’s expertise is incorporated into their version of the product immediately. Most SaaS sales processes have shifted from education to execution sales , so buyers understand their needs before speaking to an account executive. Sales teams employing co-customization start the sales process with their product, accelerating sales execution by showing rather than telling. Second, co-customization best equips the internal champion to win internal approval for a purchase. The data analyst’s initial intent to purchase is quickly converted into a tangible, shareable, interactive product using real data. What could be more compelling as an internal sales tool? Just try it. Other internal customers of the product can tinker and test, and the data analyst is empowered to assuage questions along the way. In addition, the analysts initial effort induces a degree of commitment to the product - after all, it’s the analysts code that is powering Looker already for the company. Third, customers train themselves through the sales process. From the beginning to the end of the sales cycle, data analysts become proficient in Looker, relying on help during the sales process to ramp their understanding of the product. By the end of the sales process and implementation, the customer’s data team has been using Looker long enough to support their internal stakeholders. This on-boarding minimizes churn. Whether you call it co-customization or co-development, the idea of collaborating with a customer through a sales process to customize a SaaS product to a customer’s needs accelerates sales and maximizes customer success. Customers feel the responsiveness of the vendor, understand how the product will fit into their organization, and educate themselves through the process. Not every product is a good match for this type of sales tactic. But for the companies whose unit economics can justify the investment, co-customization can be a powerful growth technique.

When I was a PM at Google, we conducted customer research often to understand our customers’ opinions on AdSense. In 2005, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft were vying to win dominant share of advertising pages across large publishers. Customer knowledge, both qualitative and quantitative, informed product development, and that research became a key part of AdSense’s success. A few years later when I joined Redpoint, I learned that venture capitalists perform similar customer research during diligence. While the ultimate use of the data might differ, the actual investigations and interviews are remarkably alike. During a typical diligence process, we will interview customers and might ask them questions like these: How did you hear about the product? We’re looking to understand what customer acquisition mechanisms are working for the company, and if they are consistent with the company’s perceptions. What process did you use to pick this product over the competition? This question sheds light into the sales process, most notably the key stakeholders and the ultimate decision-maker, and also sales cycle length. Why did you choose this product? I’m digging for product differentiation, and to understand if there are different customer segments in the market who might use a different product to satisfy unique needs. Which teams in the company use the product, and how has that changed over time? This inquiry reveals the key users, the potential for account growth and negative churn possibility. How important is this product compared to other software? Validate that, in the words of Paul Graham, this is a hair-on-fire problem. If it’s not in the top 5 most important needs, sales cycles will lag, because no internal champions will promote it and budget will be difficult to secure. How much do you pay? Is it worth more or less than X product? Ascertain whether the customer believes the return on investment is wildly in their favor. Also, I’m determining whether the company is successfully matching their branding with their price point with a relative pricing question . A premium product should be priced that way and be marketed as such. How quickly is the product evolving? How satisfied are you with customer support and working with the company? Both of these questions indicate churn risk. Fast evolving products with great customer support convey to users that the startup cares about delighting them.  It’s also a great diagnostic tool for exposing overselling. Do the salespeople in the company overpromise to attain quota, only for the product to disappoint later on? To whom would you recommend this product? This question aims to understand the breadth of potential customers the product can serve, and the vigor with which an existing customer would recommend. It’s a qualitative proxy for market size, eg, “Everybody vs real estate startups based in Wisconsin.” All of these questions are customer and product discovery questions, almost identical to the ones product managers use to understand if the company has unlocked product-market fit. In addition, these interviews surface insights about marketing positioning and true perception in the market; customer support effectiveness; overselling; and product importance. It shouldn’t be a surprise that potential investors also use them to understand fit.

Starting on October 21, I’ll be hosting a bi-weekly event from the Redpoint San Francisco offices called SaaS Office Hours. During these two hours, we will discuss the tactical issues and questions facing seed and Series A SaaS companies in a small group. That’s why we call them Office Hours. Rather than deliver presentations, SaaS Office Hours are meant to be casual, tactical and collaborative. Sometimes, we’ll invite guests for off-the-cuff conversations and Q&A focused on focused questions like how should I build my startup’s marketing team? How can I evangelize my product to developers? How do I create the right kind of recruiting process? And we have a great lineup so far. On October 21st, Bill Macaitis, the CMO of Slack will kick off SaaS Office Hours to talk about early stage marketing . On November 4, we’ll chat with Kenny van Zant, the creator of high velocity inside sales techniques and flywheel business models . Two weeks later, SaaS Office Hours will host Pete Koomen, founder of Optimizely to talk about product management from the very earliest days. And later in the year, Maia Josebachvilli, the VP of People & Strategy at Greenhouse will join us to share insights about recruiting metrics and Adam Gross, head of product at Heroku and former VP of Platform and Developer Marketing at Salesforce, about building developer products. Other times, SaaS Office Hours will be structured like true office hours with one-on-one conversations with Redpoint partners to walk through tactical questions facing seed and Series A SaaS companies. To keep the conversations intimate, we’ll cap the attendance at about 20-40 people. Every two weeks, I’ll write a post about the upcoming speaker and topic and link to a registration page, and we’ll invite a subset of people who register to the event. To that end, we’re excited to welcome Bill Macaitis to SaaS Office Hours on October 21. Bill is an amazing marketing leader who has pioneered many of the data-driven marketing techniques in use today. In 2008, Bill joined Salesforce as SVP of Online Marketing and Operations. In 2012, Bill became CMO of Zendesk and in 2014, Bill joined Slack as CMO. Needless to say, Bill has built some of the most unique and efficient marketing organizations in SaaS companies. Best of all, Bill is a wonderfully nice guy. If you’re interested in attending, please fill out the form at SaaS Office Hours . I’m really looking forward to this series of casual events focused on tactical issues. Through them, I hope we can help early stage founders maximize the potential of their businesses and build some great friendships along the way.

How big is your SaaS startup’s sales pipeline? How big does it need to be to achieve next month’s bookings target? What is the ratio of the sales pipeline to bookings? What should it be? When asked these questions during a fundraising pitch, one CEO responded with the number of demos per account executive per day to attain next month’s bookings, impressively conveying his command of his business. A startup’s leadership should know the number of customers, sales and marketing qualified leads to meet or exceed plan at all times.   If you haven’t performed this exercise this before, use the interactive worksheet below. Change any of the text boxes and the figures will update. If you’re reading this post by email, please click through. Some email clients don’t allow JavaScript for security. Let’s examine a hypothetical company with a bookings plan of $250k, an Average Revenue per Customer of $20k. The typical account executive at this company owns a $500k ARR quota, and on average achieves 75% of quota. 20% of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) convert to Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs). And 20% of SQLs convert to customers. Monthly Bookings Target, $ ARPC, $ AE Quota, $ Annual Quota Attainment, decimal Number of AEs Required 8 MQL to SQL SQL to Customer Conversion Rates, decimal Leads and Customers Required to Attain Bookings Goal MQL SQL Customers Per Rep 79 8 2 Total 625 64 13 The worksheet tells us quite a bit about this company. To attain next month’s bookings number, the business needs 8 fully ramped account executives. Each of these account executives must sell two contracts. To close these two customers, the company must generate 8 sales qualified leads, and 79 marketing qualified leads. In total, the company must generate 625 MQLs and 64 SQLs.  Note, I’m rounding up in each of the calculations to be conservative, which is why the numbers may not divide evenly as integers. These figures should inform sales and marketing hiring plans. The company requires a certain number of account executives to close customers and a certain number of marketers or sales development reps to generate leads. The data also provide a basic estimate of marketing costs. Multiplying the lead requirements by cost per lead provides a base level estimate for marketing spend in a given period. From which a business could compute cost of customer acquisition, and many other figures. All of these elements to the plan, whether account executives or leads, have a latency. Account executives must be hired and they must be trained. This takes time, perhaps 3-4 months for very efficient sales teams. Then they must be provided leads, which require time some time to produce. And of course, the sales cycle introduces latency to bookings. While this worksheet doesn’t include any of those important factors, they must be considered. Returning to the first set of questions, the ratio of the pipeline has to be 5x the bookings target, or the inverse of the SQL-to-customer ratio which is 0.2 for our hypothetical company. This makes sense. Only one in five leads will convert to a paying customer. There are often questions around what is lead. As long as you’re measuring success rate from whatever point you call a lead a lead or an SQL an SQL, then the definitions don’t matter for this analysis. Last, this concept can also be applied at an individual level. Different account executives will have varying conversion rates. These vary as a function individual skill, experience, region, geography, industry and other factors. Therefore, the required pipeline to enable each sales person to achieve their quota is again just the inverse of their lead to close rate. Understanding the go-to-market requirements of a business is an essential skill at every stage of a SaaS company, and with just a few basic measurements, founders and CEOs of SaaS companies can understand precisely what the company must achieve each month to exceed its goals.

Customer pull is an amazing feeling for a startup. Because the customer demand is visceral, everything seems to move quickly: sales is booking deals quicker than can be on-boarded; product and engineering are rushing to build the features customers request; marketing’s efforts to raise awareness of the business are magnified by word of mouth; and recruiting is doing all they can to fill the looming vacancies. At seed, the first signs of strong customer pull are the quality of pilot and trial interest. While the volume varies by price point - freemium companies may have thousands of early customers, while $100k+ ACV companies may only have a handful - positive usage  patterns indicate strong customer pull. So too does frequent product feedback. In addition, vibrant word of mouth proxied by social media mentions/follows, Github stars/forks for open source projects, and  newsletter subscriber counts mark products with substantial latent demand. As a seed stage company grows, hires a sales team and deploys the product to more customers, the signs of customer pull evolve. Product engagement remains high. The company transitions from pilots with friendly customers to product sales. The sales cycles are fast, often less than 30 days: an email, one to three conversations, sometimes without a demo, and straight to a signed contract. As a result of these fast sales cycles , sales people exceed their quotas substantially. In some companies I’ve seen, sales reps a month in are booking more than $100k in new ARR per month. In a year or so, early customers will begin to renew their contracts, and these customers increase their spend rewarding the startup with negative net churn . Box, New Relic and others have achieved 30% negative net churn/account expansion annually. But in the early stages, companies with exceptional customer pull observe greater than 100% annual negative net churn. In addition to serving the core customer base well, startups with strong customer pull observe larger companies pulling them up market. Often these Fortune 2000 companies impose security, compliance and complex decision-making processes. But in these cases, these behemoths relax these constraints because they perceive the product as critical to their success. These signals of customer pull are strong validators for founders to understand when they have achieved a true product market fit and Templeton compression . Not surprisingly, these customer pull signals are the same investors use to understand the growth potential of a business.

“What is the one equation that describes our business?” asked Scott, our new director at Google, during one of our first meetings. I had been there only for a few quarters, so I was startled when he asked. I had never viewed our business this way, but after he asked the question, I wondered why I hadn’t. It seemed obvious in retrospect. What started as a simple question became a complex and insightful exercise. Over his first week or so, through many interviews like mine, Scott developed that equation for AdSense and it filled a whiteboard. I’ve reproduced it above in a simplified form. Scott plied the equation to grasp how the business worked. He refined and polished the equation, until he identified all the contributing parts to revenue. These questions led him to understand historical product development decisions, advertiser and publisher policies and the values of the company. They revealed the strengths of the company, but also made plain many assumptions underpinning previous decisions were no longer true. Identifying those inaccuracies and correcting them unlocked tremendous revenue growth. The equation became an important management tool in our conversations. When we discussed new projects, Scott would ask me to point on the whiteboard where the project it fit within the equation - which lever the project impacted and whether the project could materially accelerate revenue growth. Boy, did it clarify priorities. This equation remained on his office white board for years. Every time I walked past his office, I would glance at that equation, I’d smile. What an incisive management tool. More than helping to question assumptions, prioritize projects and align teams, the idea of a single equation diagnose the best place to focus. A 5% increase in each of the top line metrics would bolster revenue by 5%. But a 5% increase in impressions meant more publisher acquisitions. In contrast, a 5% increase in cost per click implied more advertiser acquisition. Depending on the comparative unit economics of at the time, Scott could recommend the right path. Here’s a first order equation for a SaaS company: And one for a market place: After that experience, I’ve come to believe using the fundamental equation of a business can be a terrific best practice for prioritizing key initiatives across product, marketing, sales and customer success. It’s also a great tool to elevate  a team conversation from the everyday tasks to more strategic initiatives.

Today, 70% of startups in the US that raise a Series A have raised a seed round. That’s up from 50% ten years ago. In the same period, the amount of seed capital invested in the US has increased about 10x from $200M per year to $2B . What does this imply for early stage founders? First, it implies greater competition at the Series A. Larger seed rounds enable a seed stage company to achieve more - more growth, more revenue, more hiring. In addition, these larger seed rounds enable successful startups to raises larger series As, and the data supports it. The correlation coefficient between seed round size and Series A size in the Crunchbase data set is 0.89 across all startup sectors. That’s not to say there’s a Series A crunch, where a surfeit of seed companies are vying for a small pool of Series A capital. Series A volumes have more than doubled in the same period . Instead, the competition is about progress. Series A investors expect a company to be further along it its development compared to ten years ago. I hear this in the advice that seed investors provide to SaaS companies. A few years ago, startups targeted $50k of MRR before starting their process. Today, I hear from founders they aim for at least $80-$100k of MRR before starting conversations when targeting larger Series As. Second, the prevalence of seed rounds and the variance in their size has bifurcated the Series A market. There are classic Series As and momentum Series As. Classic Series As of $3-5M are the most common round sizes for startups raising between $0.5M and $2M. Momentum Series As of about $10M follow seed rounds of $4M or more. Of course, we can start arguing about semantics: is a $4M round truly a seed? What does Series A really mean today? Series A used to be the first institutional investment in a company, but with the rise of institutional seed investors, that’s no longer an accurate definition. For founders, the difference in wording is an an advantage. A modern Series A company is much larger in staff, revenue and achievement than a Series A company from 2005 and consequently, conveys a greater sense of momentum and growth rate than its predecessors. Third, this greater competition from startups will increasingly come from California and New York, both of which have benefitted disproportionately from  the seed market boom. The three other top seed geographies, Massachussetts, Texas and Washington have seen rises , but not the 10x of California and New York. All of this data reinforces the idea that fundraising is an important skill for founders to hone . Managing a company through the right milestones to achieve a strong seed round positions the business for a sizable A, and so on - and this is doubly true in a seed bull market.

SaaS Enabled Marketplaces benefit from a unique advantage in their go-to-market. They have a panoptic view of their market place, which over time provides them an unassailable competitive advantage. SEMs provide software to suppliers and consumers, and then make a market between them. The first SEMs flourished in advertising. Google manages one of the world’s largest advertising market places. They provide software to publishers, the supply side, which manages available ad inventory with a product called DoubleClick for Publishers, or DFP. In addition, Google provides the demand-side inventory system, AdWords, to help advertisers manage their budget. In between, Google operates an advertising marketplace, AdX.   Today there are an increasing number examples of SEMs including StyleSeat (beauty), Zenefits (benefits), Quartzy (lab management), Makeable (manufacturing), Yardbook (landscaping), Joist (construction), among others. Because SEMs deploy SaaS to both the supply side and the demand side, these companies can develop an exceptional understanding of their market.  Access to supplier data and consumer demand provides four key advantages to SEMs. First, SEMs understand the supply/demand curve at every second. They know how many people are planning landscaping projects, and how many landscapers might be available in the near future to help with a particular kind of garden design. Consequently, if there is a supply/demand imbalance, the SEM can acquire more landscapers or more homeowners to balance the market place. Second, SEMs understand the operational excellence of their suppliers. Joist can record which contractors complete their projects on schedule and on budget. This data enables the marketplace to amass census scale data on supplier performance, granular to the type of service rendered. The SEM can better qualify and match supply and demand. In addition, SEMs can recommend to suppliers how to improve their performance, e.g. raise the profile of an ad unit for a publisher or offer Brazilian blowouts to a stylist. Third, the accumulated data on both consumer demand and supplier performance compounds into a unique data asset that erects a moat around the business. The first successful SEM in a market will recognize the best types of consumers and the best types of suppliers and pursue them before others. This furthers the winner-take-all dynamics of already latent within the market place. Fourth, because of the visibility into supply/demand, a deep understanding of supplier excellence, and the ability to identify the right types of buyers and sellers, SEMs benefit from a more efficient go to market. We did this extensively at Google, using signals from AdSense to understand which additional publishers and advertisers to acquire.  The SEM acquires more sellers when needed and more buyers when needed, increasing the efficiency of marketing compared to blind acquisition. This informed acquisition improves the experience for buyers and sellers by maintaining an optimal amount of liquidity in the market place. Once stood up, SEMs are powerful forces. Because they instrument both the demand side and the supply side of a market place, these businesses accumulate unique data that reinforces the business’s strength.

![image]( https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/kogler_wall.jpg" width=100%/alt =“Peter Kogler Bends Space with Lines”> In 1977, a British polymath named Christopher Alexander , who studied Math and Architecture at Cambridge and was awarded Harvard’s first PhD in architecture, published a book titled A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction. This book would transform the architecture world, and more surprisingly, forever influence the way computer scientists write software. A Pattern Language prescribed rules for constructing safe buildings, from the layout of a region of 8M people, to the size and shape of fireplaces within a home. Today, A Pattern Language still ranks among the top two or three best-selling architecture books because it created a lexicon of 253 design patterns that form the basis of a common architectural language. A decade after A Pattern Language was published, Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham , two American software engineers, presented the paper “ Using Pattern Languages for Object Oriented Programs ” that reshaped Alexander’s ideas for computer programming. The paper catalyzed a movement to identify programming patterns that solved problems in elegant, consistent ways that had been proven in the real world. It inspired the Gang of Four to write the seminal computer science book Design Patterns which formalized concepts like WYSIWYG , Iterators and Factories , among others. These design patterns have infiltrated the curriculums and patois of computer scientists ever since. Design patterns continue to spread widely. For example, management science calls them best practices . As the prevalence of data within companies surges, and businesses adopt data-driven cultures, data design patterns will become emerge - much as they have in management, architecture and computer science. Some of these design patterns exist. But over the next few years, they will be formalized and refined. Looker is taking a big step in that direction with their release of Blocks . Blocks are design patterns that enable a data scientist to define an active user once, so that everyone else in the company can begin to analyze user activity using a consistent definition. These data design patterns have been field tested across hundreds of customers and documented extensively . And they are meant to be generalizable and flexible across different data sources like Salesforce, Marketo, Zendesk and meant to be tailored to the needs of each organization. Much as the design patterns in computer science and architecture simplified the tasks of coders and architects, data design patterns, like Looker’s Blocks, simplify the lives of data scientists, and ensure that everyone using data is using the right data every time. Data design patterns are still relatively new and will evolve as companies create and capture new types of data, and develop new analytical methods to understand the trends within. These data building blocks will be just as fundamental to data science and analysis as Alexander’s were to architecture and the Gang of Four’s were to computer science.

One of the most powerful levers for SaaS companies to master is payback period. Payback period is the number of months a company requires to payback its cost of customer acquisition. The median SaaS startup has a payback period of 15 months on a gross margin basis. A short payback period confers two massive advantage to a startups: smaller working capital requirements and a consequent ability to grow much faster. Let’s take a hypothetical example of a SaaS company at $625k in ARR, growing at 15% per month. The company has 25 customers each paying $25,000 and operates with an 80% gross margin. The company bills monthly. The chart above shows the amount of working capital tied up in customer acquisition as a function of payback period. If the company can achieve a 12 month payback period, $7.8M of the company’s cash will be tied up in customer acquisition. On the other hand, if the company achieves a six month payback, only $2.6M of working capital is required to achieve this growth rate, freeing $5.2M for other initiatives. The company could take this “extra” $5.2M and recycle it, by hiring more sales and marketing teams, to grow faster. Compared to the 15% baseline growth at 12 months payback, at six months payback, the company can achieve a 20% compound monthly growth rate. Instead of exiting month 12 at an $2.7M ARR, the business would be at $4.5M run rate. Of course, as a company scales its customers acquisition efforts, the payback period is sure to fluctuate and effect the working capital and growth characteristics of the business. However, those companies that achieve shorter payback periods can influence their growth rates much more effectively than companies with longer payback periods. As for companies who charge their customers for an annual subscription and annual prepay, the math is similar but the magnitude of the difference between the shorter and longer growth rates is muted relative to monthly payment, because the company will receive all of its customer acquisition cost back (in all but the 15 month case) up front. These two advantages of shorter payback periods provide tremendous leverage to the business to manage for growth or efficiency, and consequently, investors are attracted to those companies. This math underscores why customer acquisition efficiency is so compelling.

When writing the post Vertical SaaS Startups Require Different Go To Market Than Horizontal SaaS Companies , I realized that there is a perception on my part and perhaps more broadly that vertical SaaS companies enjoy greater sales efficiencies than horizontal SaaS companies. After all, vertical SaaS companies target a smaller number of potential buyers. The marketing team concentrates their media buys to target this audience, the sales team focuses on a smaller lead list. Does the data support this notion? The point chart above compares the estimated sales efficiency of 54 publicly traded SaaS companies - 10 vertical in blue and 44 horizontal in red - for two years before IPO and three years after. It’s hard to discern a difference between the two. But, if we chart the median by year, we see that the vertical SaaS companies do exhibit a higher median for each of the years. Over this time period, horizontal companies record a mean of 0.66 compared to 0.97 for vertical companies. And this difference is statistically significant (p value = 0.026) The chart of top 10 software companies by median sales efficiency shows that there is a healthy mix of both horizontal and vertical companies. Horizontal companies can also achieve terrific sales efficiencies. But the median horizontal company is less efficient. This may be because of a greater competitive pressure within the horizontal markets. Increased competition in a market segment drives up marketing costs, reduces sales win percentage and decreases sales efficiency. After this analysis, I compared a few other key metrics including revenue, revenue growth, net income, sales & marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. Metric P Value Revenue 0.28 Revenue Growth 0.20 Net Income 0.26 Sales & Marketing/Revenue 0.54 Cash from Operations 0.59 Unlike sales efficiency, none of these health metrics differ materially from vertical to horizontal SaaS companies. This may be because the number of vertical SaaS companies is relatively small still. Or, more likely, exceptionally efficient businesses can be built both with a horizontal and a vertical go-to-market strategy. For every Veeva, there is also a Kenexa. Vertical software companies do benefit from a better sales efficiency. But it’s unclear what that efficiency translates into, aside from lower sales and marketing costs. I would have suspected this efficiency would translate into better Cash from Operations, implying vertical software companies require less capital to achieve the same revenue and growth, but the data doesn’t yet support that thesis. I’m hopeful that with more vertical SaaS startups succeeding and growing quickly, we will know more with time.

Vertical SaaS requires a different go-to-market than horizontal SaaS companies. Vertical software companies, a recent important trend in SaaS startups, pursue customers only in a particular industry. They trade a more narrow customer base and consequent reduction in market size for a competitive advantage in that market segment. The most salient example, Veeva, sells software to the largest life sciences companies, which are subject to a unique regulatory regime in their sales processes. A spectacularly efficient business, Veeva raised only $4.5M in venture investment before going public six years after founding. Today, Veeva’s market cap exceeds $3.3B. Similar large market cap examples exist in real estate (CoStar - $5.8B), insurance (Guidewire - $3.7B), logistics (Fleetmatics - $1.8B) among other categories. Because vertical SaaS companies limit their potential market size by focusing on just one type of customer, they must employ a differentiated strategy to win disproportionate share of smaller market. These are the strategies I’ve observed: All vertical software companies develop uniquely focused products. A smaller target customer base may reward vertical SaaS companies with superior sales and marketing efficiencies. Fleetmatics, which sells primarily to small operators of trucking fleets and recorded about $6.5k average revenue per customer at its IPO, leverages its best-in-class product advantage to sign customers to three year or longer contracts, establishing very favorable LTV/CAC ratios. At IPO and generating about $177M, Fleetmatics recorded an estimated sales efficiency of 1.2, 50% greater than the public SaaS median. Some vertical SaaS businesses employ network effects to engender winner-take-most dynamics. For example, CoStar, which sells data on commercial real estate transactions, employs data network effects. By aggregating the most data, CoStar became the industry standard. In 2012, CoStar acquired its key competitor Loopnet to consolidate these data network effects further. Consequently, CoStar trades at a 9.1x forward multiple, in the top 10% of SaaS companies . Not bad for a business founded in 1987. Broadened product portfolios enable vertical SaaS companies to upsell existing customers more software, and cross-sell software into other teams within the existing customer base. Veeva sells content management to marketing, CRM to sales, and a unified data platform to analytics teams of their customers. At IPO in 2013, Veeva’s average revenue per customer reached about $750k. As of the company’s last annual report, customers now pay Veeva $1.13M, a 51% increase in 2 years. Choosing to start a vertical SaaS company is a strategic bet with an important trade to consider: a focused customer base which brings better sales efficiencies, narrower product scope, and potential winner-take-all-dynamics in exchange for a smaller theoretical market size. Understanding these dynamics are critical for crafting a vertical SaaS company’s go-to-market, and also for fundraising.

During their fundraising processes, founders often tell me “I’d really like to get back to building the business.” I’m certain it’s true. Every founder surely would certainly rather be building their product and company than fundraising. Nevertheless, a founder skilled in fundraising can create enormous leverage for their business and develop unassailable competitive advantages. This is why it’s critical for early stage founders to invest time to perfect their pitches. Let’s suppose we have two founders who operate identical and competing businesses. One of these two founders, who started a business called Turbo, raises capital better than the other by 15%. This deftness manifests as 15% larger rounds. So over the life of the company, Turbo business raises 15% more than Standard. That may not seem like much, but the chart above demonstrates that compounding this 15% advantage over six years results in a 50% larger business for the more skillful founder of Turbo. I’ve assumed both businesses start at $1M in ARR, and then grow by 300%, 200%, 100%, 100%, 75% and 75% for those six years. Turbo has a cheaper cost of capital. Suffering the same dilution as its competition, Turbo raises more money in each round. Consequently, the business can invest more dollars than Standard to hire additional salespeople who close more customers, deploy incremental dollars in marketing to build a brand faster, hire more engineers to develop the product a little bit faster. All of these small advantages intensify over time propelling Turbo to become the dominant player in the market. In SaaS, these types of scenarios - where two or more companies compete directly for the same buyers - are common. Often, there isn’t substantial technology differentiation among competitors, which amplifies the importance of difference in fundraising skill. A bigger balance sheet translates into a fundamental and often insurmountable competitive advantage. Not captured in the scenario above is the fact that over time, Turbo will be perceived by the market as the winner. As the perceived runner-up, Standard will be hampered in fundraising processes. Investors will ask themselves, do we want to invest in second place in this market? This perception will accelerate the compounding benefit of the market leader. If attending seven years of YC Demo Days has taught me anything, it’s that the skill of pitching can be learnt.  Though it may not be a favorite pastime of many founders, fundraising is a critical skill for CEOs, and well worth the investment of practice, external help with pitch design and sales training. The advantage of a smaller cost of capital can compound over time to catapult a company to market dominance, particularly in markets where technology isn’t the basis of differentiation.

Much has been written about the consumerization of IT , the movement fueling many SaaS startup’s growth by targeting individuals in a target customer called B2C2B , rather than selling top down. But until yesterday, I hadn’t found anyone who had quantified the size of the movement. In mid-2014, CEB published Harnessing Business-Led IT to answer this question. While the entire report is worth reading, the chart above answers the particular question above. Just how big is B2C2B? About 30% of IT spend. In their research, CEB discovered that for every dollar of IT spend, another 40 cents are spent by line of business owners buying software directly. In addition, the data illustrates this pattern of software purchasing spans most of the key departments within a company. While sales and marketing top the list, finance, engineering and HR also buy software this way. As the report indicates, IT purchasing occurs across four categories spanning departments: process automation, collaboration, analytics and customer interface, with B2C2B companies most typically addressing the last three. Depending on the department, CEB estimates bottoms up purchasing represents anywhere from 36 to 72% of a department’s total spend. Without longitudinal data, we can’t conclude much about the pace of change in this trend. But the growth of the many B2C2B SaaS companies is a strong indicator that at some point in the next few years, more than half of  software will be purchased bottoms up. This is a fundamental shift. It’s an shot across the bow, a battle cry, a bugle call to the incumbents that they there are startups at their customers’ front doors bearing gifts .

The SaaS ecosystem has been evolving incredibly quickly. Most of the time, the changes in the ecosystem are embodied in one particular company which grows exceptionally quickly. Focusing on these fast-growers, the macro shifts can be hard to discern. Last week, Okta released a report Business at Work sweeps across SaaS to reveal these recent evolutions. These are the points that I found most interesting. First, most companies, irrespective of size from 1-4k+ employees, use 14 SaaS applications. Though the report doesn’t detail these 14 products, I suspect there is a remarkable consistency across companies in which applications those are. Here’s my stab at that list: CRM, Marketing Automation, ERP, Expense Management, Analytics, Email, Collaboration, Document Storage, Payroll, HRIS, ATS, IaaS, Customer Support, Recruiting. SaaS startups are either competing within these categories or creating a new category. The consistency of 14 apps underscores the importance of category creation for SaaS companies creating software for newer workflows, in contrast to those replacing existing products. Second, the chart points to the teams and departments where SaaS has the greatest penetration to date.  Collaboration tools should top the list because employees bring them to work. Sales teams, always looking for an edge, also belong to the early adopter segment and buy CRM and online meetings software. Then finance tools for operations management and expenses. Marketing, engineering and HR follow. Third, mobile is increasingly important across all types of buyers. More than 20% of end users log in mobile; 2.5% log in exclusively on mobile. I’m curious how much user acquisition occurs on mobile. But if SaaS usage trends follow consumer usage - which for some ecommerce and messaging products top 70%+ mobile usage - then mobile will undoubtedly become a critical user engagement and acquisition platform. Fourth, software serving engineering teams tie collaboration applications for the fastest growing types of SaaS products. PagerDuty, AWS and New Relic are the three listed in Okta’s reports. Each of these companies are building terrific businesses serving a customer segment historically viewed as a challenging buyer. The SaaS ecosystem is changing quite quickly. By virtue of their position in the market, Okta has a panopticon view of the types of SaaS applications succeeding in the market. And while some of the secular trends like the importance of mobile and the popularity of SaaS colloboration tools are evident, others most notably the rise of SaaS for developers may be a bit more obscure.

Over dinner, a veteran product manager argued most SaaS products’ onboarding practices miss a crucial step: create value for the user in the first session. After that conversation, I signed up for many brand-name SaaS products pretending it was for the first time, and I couldn’t help but agree with him. Most SaaS products guide a user through three steps. First, collect the requisite data to create an account, like email and password. Second, configure integrations with related services, customize the platform and/or invite other key users. Third, educate users about the product by indicating the most important menus and actions. The third step has recently become synonymous with onboarding and many product teams have invested there. Clement Vouillon details the five types of on-boarding strategies, with examples, in his post on onboarding : passive tour, the active tour, video on boarding, slide on boarding, and step-by-step walkthrough with fake data. While this may be the state-of-the-art for most SaaS startups, it’s not enough to optimize the funnel. As the seasoned product manager articulated, the onboarding process must create some value for the user during that sign-up session, in order to keep the user coming back. All the products I tried either stepped me through an explanation of the product or simply left me at the home screen after registration. I felt like an new employee during my first day at work. I had signed my W-2 tax form, received an email account, been shown the route between my office and the lunchroom, and then told to get to work. I’m certain there are best-in-class user onboarding flows out there, and if you know of one, please email me, because I’d like to update this post and feature that workflow. Although I don’t have data to support the argument, I believe that achieving that magical moment - solving a part of the user’s within the first session - is essential to great user onboarding.

The public markets are down more than 10% from their highs in the last few months. Public SaaS companies have been particularly hard hit. The chart above shows the enterprise value of publicly traded SaaS companies. Many of them are down substantially more than 10%. Let’s dig in a bit more. While there are five companies who currently sit at their all time highs, as of August 21, more than 90% of the SaaS companies are below at a median decline of 40%. Apigee is down 80% and MobileIron has lost more than 60%. The impact to SaaS valuations, in the public markets, is broad, and most of these names, which have benefitted from better than average multiples, are seeing the downside of those aggressive valuations in the form of larger than typical corrections. It’s not that the fundamentals of these businesses have changed broadly; rather public market investors view newly minted public software companies with more caution The chart above shows the Enterprise Value to Forward Revenue Multiple over the last two years. The dispersion in multiples in late 2013, when Xero topped 20x, has become more concentrated recently. Nearly all companies now trade at less than 10x forward revenues, and the median has dropped in August by 16%. Zooming into the median, we see that August’s figure is 5.2 EV to Forward Revenue is tied for the third lowest in the last 24 months. One interpretation of forward multiple: investors are decreasingly confident in the ability of SaaS companies’ to achieve their projections. This is likely informed by the turmoil in China and the recently increasing volatility of the US stock market. Paraphrasing Burton Malkiel’s seminal book, Wall Street prices are somewhat of a random walk - and so we shouldn’t extract extreme conclusions from the perturbations of the stock market. But there has been a material correction in the valuation of public SaaS/software companies in the past few months. It’s hard not to wonder when the realities of the public market will begin to influence the private markets.

I’ve been to many YC Demo Days and I always look forward to them. This year was no exception. There are so many wonderful ideas and companies founded by terrific entrepreneurs. In addition to the pitches themselves, the types of companies presenting forbear trends in the startup world more broadly. To get a better sense of those trends, I’ve categorized more than 250 startups in 3 recent classes and plotted the evolution of the classes. The bar chart above shows that the split between consumer and enterprise has remained constant over these three classes. Healthcare companies, those focusing on drug discovery or deeper diagnostics have notably risen in number in 2015. This increase in activity seems to be driven by advances in data analysis for drug discovery and novel sensors. Looking into consumer YC startups more deeply, a few salient trends emerge. First, commerce startups have increased steadily, and represent 10% of the last class. This trend opposes the broader VC market’s investment patterns . Consumer services, which includes consumer search, dating, daily deals and others, have steadily declined, potentially because of increased competition in those categories. Startups pursuing consumer finance have popped recently, not driven by Bitcoin, but by a wave of founders bringing more sophisticated financial tools to the masses. Gaming is out of fashion, following the broader market. Surprisingly, media companies spiked this year, driven by a Twitch for X phenomenon. On Demand companies, both food delivery, services and logistics, are constant. Last the decline of social media investment is consistent with the rest of the market. Growth investors have been pursuing social media companies at twice the rate of seed stage investors . Turning to enterprise, collaboration tools have fallen likely dissuaded from entering the fray by the huge success of Slack and others. Financial management tools like expense management or receivables financing are growing steadily. The important story in Enterprise YC companies is the prominence of vertical SaaS - e.g., construction, real estate and legal software - all industries who have yet to modernize and so present terrific opportunities to build big businesses. Last, sales and marketing software products have declined in popularity, also potentially because of the tremendous competition in those segments. One analyst counts more than 2000 software products catering to marketing teams, up from 1000 the year before. Demo Day is a window into the future of consumer and enterprise investments. If this data is any indication, we should see more commerce and consumer finance companies; and more vertical software businesses in the next few years.

The most potent weapon in sales is understanding a buyer’s perception of time. As Mark Roberge wrote , “At HubSpot, this lacking sense of urgency is the number one objection we face in the sales funnel.” To succeed, SaaS startups’ sales teams must consistently create urgency in the sales process. Time is scarce. Either the seller’s time is scarce or the buyer’s time is scarce. Understanding that scarcity and focusing the buyer on it is the key to repeatable sales. Seller time scarcity works well when a sales team responds to inbound demand. The inbound customer is often in the considering or intend to buy parts of the sales funnel, and very close to purchase. Seller scarcity provides the final push. There are many forms of seller scarcity: offers good until a day, a limited number of units available at a particular price, 7 day trials and so on. Buyer urgency presents a greater challenge. To trigger a feeling of urgency during an outbound sales call, a salesperson must obtain some information about a pressing business goal. When is the latest you need to X? is a probing question designed to find an urgent need within the business that justifies investing time with the salesperson. In Mark’s example from Hubspot, the buyer urgently needs to increase top of the funnel leads. In Looker’s case, data teams urgently need to provide data to product managers and marketers and finance teams. Other times, sales teams sell an urgency to protect a business against a liability or insure the business against risk. Security companies like Duo Security seize this urgency to sell their products. Faster sales cycles are a competitive advantage. Faster sales cycles enable companies to iterate their sales techniques more rapidly, evaluate sales people quicker, and test marketing effectiveness swiftly. Most importantly, faster sales cycles mean speedy growth, which eases fundraising, hiring and brand building. For SaaS startups, finding product market fit is important, but developing urgency consistently within sales processes is equally critical. The strategies that uncover time scarcity and focus the buyer on this urgency form the basis of great sales playbooks.

While culture may seem an ambiguous and fuzzy concept, strong cultures are the best way for leaders to manage their companies throughout their evolution. One founder/CEO described his company’s rapid growth to several hundred employees in just a few years this way. First, I was one of a few founders. As we grew, I became a manager of people. Then a manager of managers. And now I’m a manager of managers of managers. At this scale, CEOs can’t be in every room opining on each choice, but they can influence how each decision in those rooms is made. As Jeff Bezos said in 2014, “My main job today: I work hard at helping to maintain the culture.” There’s no better known treatise on culture than Netflix’s Freedom and Responsibility deck . Like Netflix, many companies publish their values. For example, Google enumerates the 10 Things We Know to be True. Each of these items outlines the culture at the company, which influences the company in three ways: hiring, daily decisions, vision/goals. For a culture to succeed, the values hammered to the wall must accurately reflect the measures used to determine the employees hired, promoted and let go. Culture influences hiring. First, publicly posting the values of the company empowers candidates to see if the company’s values match their own. Second, the interview questions and interview scoring criteria embodies the company’s key values, and ascertain if the candidate is a good cultural fit. Googliness is the key attribute Google uses to evaluate cultural fit. Inside of companies with strong cultures, new hires immediately sense whether they are at home and will stay or they are a fish out of water and should go. This reinforces the culture of the business. Culture influences daily decisions. Contrast Google’s notion “Fast is better than slow” with Apple’s “Don’t ship until it’s perfect.” Neither philosophy is superior to the other, but they will attract different types of people. One encourages risks, while the other champions craftmanship. Google’s culture works for the web, where code pushes are immediate. Apple’s fosters better results in hardware where small mistakes can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Each philosophy works to maximize the advantages of the company given their constraints. Culture influences the direction of the business. Leaders who create cultures that reward aggressive goal setting will find their teams rising to meet bold internal challenges. The SpaceX jobs page embodies this idea. Entitled “The Road to the Red Planet”, it reads: SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars. and SpaceX is like Special Forces… we do the missions that others think are impossible. We have goals that are absurdly ambitious by any reasonable standard, but we’re going to make them happen. Elon Musk’s ambition is stark and clear. I’m sure everyone who works at SpaceX understands exactly how Musk defines success. Great leaders manage through culture. It’s one of the great tools growing organizations can use to ensure the teams they build share the same values, the company makes decisions in consistent ways, and drive teams to achieve bold visions. Like strong magnetic fields, culture can penetrate an organization to make sure everyone is pointed in the same direction.

In a book called The Outsiders - Eight Unconventional CEOs and their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success , the author William Thorndike asks the question, who have been the best CEOs ever? And what metric should be used to gauge them? Thorndike doesn’t choose Jobs or Welch or Gates. Instead, he selects the 8 CEOs whose company’s share price appreciated the most compared to the S&P 500. While Welch grew GE share price at 20% compounded, he did so when the S&P 500 grew at 14% annually. Great CEOs, he argues, grow their business value in headwinds and tailwinds. Of the 8 chosen CEOs, Warren Buffet of Berkshire Hathaway is the only name I recognized. The other companies included some household names, but most I didn’t recognize: Capital Cities, Teledyne, General Dynamics, TCI, Washington Post, Ralston Purina, General Cinema. Yet, all of these companies witnessed decades of growth and appreciation far above market performance. Among these 8 CEOs, Thorndike states they have one common attribute. They are iconoclastic. In the 1986 Berkshire Hathaway annual report, Warren Buffett looked back on his first twenty-five years as a CEO and concluded that the most important and surprising lesson from his career to date was the discovery of a mysterious force, the corporate equivalent of teenage peer pressure, that impelled CEOs to imitate the actions of their peers. He dubbed this powerful force the institutional imperative and noted that it was nearly ubiquitous, warning that effective CEOs needed to find some way to tune it out…How? They found an antidote in a shared managerial philosophy, a worldview that pervaded their organizations and cultures and drove their operating and capital allocating decisions. This octuplet of CEOs challenged their companies not necessarily to generate the most revenue, employ the most people, lease the most beautiful offices, acquire the largest competitors, or be on the cover of the most magazines - or in today’s era, raise the most money at the highest valuation - but become the most valuable using the the smallest amount of capital. As Tom Murphy, CEO of Capital Cities said, “The goal is not to have the longest train, but to arrive at the station first using the least fuel.” And to be the fastest, most efficient train, great CEOs must understand capital allocation. Paraphrasing the author, CEOs have five choices for deploying capital: investing in operations, acquisition, issuing dividends, paying down debt, or repurchasing stock. And three alternatives for raising it: generating cash flow, issuing debt, or raising equity. Early stage founders will mostly invest in operations and occasionally acquire other companies. The others are quite rare. So the main responsibility of the startup CEO is to determine which operational initiatives to pursue and how much capital to invest behind them. Thorndike argues that each of these iconoclastic CEOs had a disciplined and metrics-driven process for deciding which projects to pursue. Secondly and equally importantly, the startup CEO must be able to provide the capital the business requires to pursue the CEO’s chosen initiatives. The third imperative is to hire the best team and operate a decentralized organization where as much of the decision-making as possible is pushed down to managers, who understand their part of the business best. Understanding how these eight CEOs compounded the value of their companies several hundred times over is fascinating. While the stories of many of the iconic leaders have been told, these quieter stories of masterful management provide just as much, if not more, insight into how to build an enduring and exceptionally valuable company.

No matter the stage of the business, startups need to manage the size of their Employee Stock Option Pool or ESOP. The ESOP contains the shares set aside by the company for hiring and retaining employees. Like a financial budget, ESOP budgets help a startup plan how to finance its growth. Most Series A companies create pools of 15-25% of outstanding stock. When a startup is young, the equity has the potential to be quite valuable, but isn’t worth very much at the time. To attract great employees, the startup has to provide large grants. According to Leo Polovet’s terrific analysis of Angelist job offer data these grants vary from 0.25% to 3% for the first 34 or so employees. By taking the mid-point of the equity range, multiplying by the  number of employees, and summing, we can estimate the equity requirement to hire the first 34 people totals to 22.8%. Hence the 15-25% rule of thumb. At some point, the company will have granted most of the shares in the ESOP to employees, and will have to create new shares for the next wave of hiring. This is called expanding the pool. A Series A company would likely expand its ESOP as part of a Series B financing, adding perhaps another 5-10%, depending on the hiring plan of the company. Series C and later companies tend to add 1-2% each year to the pool; or more if they plan to hire executives who can command about 1% or more of outstanding shares. Sometimes, a company expands the pool between financings. To do this, the board votes to add more shares to the current share count. Each pool expansion dilutes the existing shareholders. Because the value of shares increases substantially with the growth of the startup, new invested capital and diminished risk of the business, new employee grants should offer fewer shares over time. However, the smaller number of shares will be worth the same or more now. Often at or after the Series B, startups will split their shares. Series A companies typically have 10M shares outstanding and after the Series B, those 10M shares will split 1:3 or 1:4, creating about 40M shares plus those of the new round. There are many reasons to split shares, but I won’t go into them here. At some point after the Series B, the startup should create a compensation committee that includes the head of HR and two board members who are not employees of the company. Among other responsibilities, the compensation committee establishes standard offer ranges, which include salary and equity, for all the levels of new hires. The compensation committee benchmarks the company’s offers against industry survey data and adjusts as necessary. In addition, the compensation committee is responsible for creating an annual ESOP budget - the total number of shares the company will grant to new hires to achieve its hiring plan each year. The committee sums the theoretical equity grants according to hiring plan to calculate the budget. Using this figure, the startup can determine when to expand the pool. Managing an ESOP well enables a company to achieve its hiring plan and minimize dilution to everyone else. When it’s time, be sure to elect a compensation committee and manage your startup’s pool diligently.

In a recent First Round Review article, former Google President of Enterprise Apps Dave Girouard voiced the importance of speed in making decisions. “Deciding on when a decision will be made from the start is a profound, powerful change that will speed everything up.” I believe this statement is broadly true, and no where else is it more tangible for me than in managing daily email. After all, what is responding to email other than a thousand decisions? Our inboxes aren’t in our control. Which emails arrive, when they arrive, we can’t determine. We do control how we engage with email, but I find it’s easy for me to fall into the abyss of treating emails as a task list .  Without a good discipline, email overruns my day. There’s a concept from computer engineering called LIFO which stands for last in, first out. LIFO captures this mentality beautifully. Most email UIs frame the situation in a LIFO queue: the last message received is the first one to receive a response, even if it may not merit the priority. For years, I treated email as a LIFO queue. With this workflow, I found it impossible to get to the bottom of my inbox and be effective. Until I found the email snooze button. Like its alarm clock cousin, the email snooze button delays the interruption. Email snooze removes an email from the inbox until a later date and time. I first came across email snooze in Dropbox’s Mailbox . Now, I use Google’s Inbox which has the same feature. And Boomerang has it, too. Email snooze has become an essential feature of email for me. When opening an email, the first question I ask myself is “when do I need to answer this?” If immediately, then I reply. Otherwise, I snooze the email until I need to respond. And then my inbox is clear. So is my mind, because I’m focusing on the things that matter now.

When we say a startup has raised a big round, we often mean the round is big in two dimensions - total amount invested and valuation. And when we say a big valuation, more precisely we imply the round was priced at a high revenue multiple. A SaaS company that will generate $400M in revenue next year that raises $200M at $1B valuation has raised a big round, but at low valuation-to-revenue multiple of 2.5x. In contrast, most high growth SaaS startups are raising at very high multiples, somewhere between 10-20x forward revenues. What are the implications of raising at a large multiple? The startup’s founders have convinced investors of their company’s ability to grow quickly and predictably. Investors are willing to pay a price ahead of the company’s current fundamentals. Let’s look at the table below to make the point. Time Until Valuation Reaches Public Market Comparable Forward Multiple 10x 15x 20x 25x 100% 0.4 1.1 1.7 2.4 CAGR 200% 0.2 0.5 0.9 1.2 300% 0.1 0.4 0.6 0.8 400% 0.1 0.3 0.4 0.6 Across the top, valuation-to-forward-revenue multiples span 10x to 25x. Forward revenues means the sum of the next twelve months of projected revenue. From top to bottom, the compound annual growth rate of revenue varies from 100% to 400%. Within each cell is how far forward an investor is paying, relative to public market valuations. Take a company growing at 300% per year. Suppose they attract an investment at a 20x forward revenue multiple. The investor has paid 0.6 years or about 7 months ahead. In other words, in 7 months, the valuation-to-forward-revenue multiple will be equal to that of the top-tier of public market SaaS companies. The investor implicitly believes the company will continue to grow at the same CAGR at least until that point. While this doesn’t sound like a hugely risky bet, remember this is 7 months past the next twelve months of revenue. So, the investor is valuing the business based on the projected revenue the company will generate 19 months from now. Should the business not achieve its plan, then the valuation of the business could be mismatched to its valuation, creating a challenging subsequent fundraising. The more future-priced a round is, the greater this risk. SaaS startups haven’t always been priced on forward multiples. Forward multiples are the most aggressive, because they assume the company will achieve its plan for the next 12 months. They assume very little execution risk. Since SaaS companies are subscription businesses, there’s a good argument that they are predictable assuming the macroeconomic environment remains stable. If/when the market should be more conservative, investors will likely revert to pricing companies on trailing revenues, rather than future revenues, which would change this math materially. Why do I compare these multiples to the public markets? The fund raising market is a continuum. On the smallest end, the continuum starts with angels and seed investors who invest tens or hundreds of thousands, then early stage investors who invest millions to around ten million, to growth investors who invest tens of millions to hundreds of millions, to public investors who invest billions in a company. It’s the public markets who set the ultimate multiples. Public companies valuations, or market capitalizations, are updated each second as they trade on exchanges. They, too, trade on multiples. And the fastest growing, most attractive SaaS companies trade at 7.2x forward-revenue-to-enterprise-value while growing 80-90% per year. When a startup goes public, it will likely trade within that range. The chart above shows the forward revenue multiple across the four quartiles of publicly traded SaaS companies. Clearly, growth is an important determinant of valuation. In fact, growth influences public SaaS companies valuation more than any other metric. It’s 6x as correlated as gross margin and 7.5x as correlated as profitability. This is true in the public markets and the private markets. So, how does a company entice an investor to pay as far forward as possible? Forward multiples increase when investors believe a business to be predictable - investors are assuming the execution of the business will achieve or beat plan. In addition, there are many other important attributes to convey about the business: competitive barriers to entry, sales efficiency, credibility of the team, ability to pitch, strength of the brand, attractiveness of the category, unit economics, the depth of the sales pipeline, churn and sales cycle. When startups raise big rounds, they’ve convinced investors their company will continue to grow very quickly and very predictably far into the future.

Startups today are growing faster than they have in the past. US VC backed startups in 1998 grew revenue 63% per year on average. In 2014, the median startup grew at 85% CAGR before going public. More impressively, newer startups must be 5x larger than 15 years ago before going public. In 1998, the median IPO-bound startup reported $11.8M in revenue in their S-1 (inflation adjusted dollars). In 2014, a startup needed $54M.  Withthe two venture backed IPOs though August 1, 2015, the trend shows no signs of abatement. These increasing growth rates are fueled by three key trends. First, the acquisition channels startups use to acquire customers address many more potential customers and enable far more cost effective marketing than twenty years ago. Second, purchasers of products, both consumers and enterprises, are much more inclined to purchase products from startups than ever before. Third, the private market investors are willing to invest in high-growth startups despite the greater losses sustained during most rapid growth. It’s not uncommon to hear startup marketing departments speak of acquiring customers on Facebook for a few dollars. But equally importantly, these marketing teams can acquire tens if not hundreds of millions of users before exhausting the acquisition channel. And in addition to Facebook, there’s LinkedIn, mobile app stores, enterprise app stores, content marketing, and a host of other customer acquisition techniques not employed 20 years ago. This quiver of options means the limiting factor for marketing teams often is cash. Because buyers are increasingly predisposed to try new products, the unit economics of these campaigns often work well, and so it’s a question of spending more to make more. Also, subscription revenue models have become broadly adopted in enterprise and some consumer segments, which provides revenue predictability. So, a startup can invest a lot of money today to generate 3x or 5x as much revenue over the customer lifetime in the next few years. In such cases, cash is the main limitation. Fortunately,  VCs are investing at potentially unprecedented rates , providing startups the cash needed to acquire as many customers as possible, even if the profitability suffers. Because many industries operate with winner-take-most dynamics, the startup that grows the fastest will raise the biggest round, will be able to grow faster, and consequently, will be able to raise more money at a higher valuation than its competitors. If the unit economics of this game are sound, then this is a terrific bull market business strategy. If on the other hand, the unit economics have yet to be proven, it’s a game of chicken among the competitors. How deep in the red are you willing to go, to achieve best in class growth rates? As a consequence of these three trends, startups are able to grow faster than ever before. And we are seeing new records set each year. The fastest social network to 100M users, the fastest software company to $50M in annual recurring revenue, etc. We also see some companies burning through hundreds of millions of dollars only to shutter. That’s the double edged sword of fast money.

We all build products based on assumptions - assumptions about our users, who they are, how they think, what they expect. When the underlying assumptions underpinning product design no longer holds, new opportunities are created. Jakob Nielsen, a famed user experience researcher, writes about one such secular dislocation of UX assumptions in the Anti-Mac interface . It’s a post written in 1995 that remains remarkably relevant today. It contemplates all the assumptions underpinning the original Apple software design, and how the old fundamentals no longer apply for users who have grown up with technology. Below, I’ve reproduced all the core Mac UI assumptions from 1995. How many of them changed with the smartphone just ten years later? The Macintosh was designed under a number of constraints, including: It needed to sell to “naive users,” that is, users without any previous computer experience. It was targeted at a narrow range of applications (mostly office work, though entertainment and multimedia applications have been added later in ways that sometimes break slightly with the standard interface). It controlled relatively weak computational resources (originally a non-networked computer with 128KB RAM, a 400KB storage device, and a dot-matrix printer). It was supported by highly impoverished communication channels between the user and the computer (initially a small black-and-white screen with poor audio output, no audio input, and no other sensors than the keyboard and a one-button mouse). It was a standalone machine that at most was connected to a printer. Because millennials will constitute 75% of the US workforce within the next ten years, software built on outdated principles like the ones above won’t survive. Users simply won’t adopt them. In fact, users will reject them outright. How many companies have migrated from on-premise Exchange to Gmail because younger users have demanded that UI? Or Slack instead of email? Or Dropbox instead of a Windows shared drive? Or RelateIQ instead of Salesforce? The vast majority of a millennial user base is dextrous with software. Consequently, their expectations of it are much greater. Multiplatform, mobile, simple and logical UI, anticipatory software powered by machine learning . The underlying assumptions of how software should be designed are changing faster and faster. These UX and technology dislocations create a broad new set of opportunity for startups,  especially bottoms up SaaS startups whose user acquisition strategy usually relies on word of mouth growth. Companies simply can’t have software built on outdated assumptions about users and succeed. Sometimes these assumptions are invalidated suddenly, an abrupt discontinuity.  The smartphone altered the interactions preferences of hundreds of millions of people in just a few years. Other times, the assumptions change more slowly, for example, with generational changes, and like the proverbial boiled frog, we are much less likely to be aware of these secular dislocations even if they are just as impactful. Every once in a while, it’s worth asking, which assumptions does your product have about its users? And how many of them have changed in the last few years?

The prevailing wisdom for hiring the first VP of Sales is roughly $1M in ARR, or whenever the company has figured out some repeatable sales process. The rationale behind this advice is, at this point, the company needs someone to build recruit, incentivize, coach and manage the team that will grow to acquire more and more business. While that all makes sense, I was curious to see if startups do this in practice, and whether the timing of the VPS differs by ACV. I catalogued the first VPS hire for about 20 fast growth SaaS companies founded in the past five or so years, and compared it to the date they were founded. The histogram above shows most of the time, fast-growth SaaS companies hire a VPS in the third year after they were founded. Since it can take 3-9 months to find a great VPS for the company, this means these startups began their search about 2 years in. This pattern of hiring a VPS about three years after the founding of the company transcends the average revenue per customer. Each startup fits into the SMB bucket of Average Revenue per Customer < $15k, Enterprise of ARPC > $100k, and Mid-Market, which is in between. Just a reminder about box plots: the top part of the box is the 75% percentile, the bottom part of the box is the 25%, the middle is the 50% and the lines show the range, and the dots indicate outliers. Regardless of the typical size of these SaaS companies’ customers, the typical company hires the first VP of Sales in the 2.75 year to 3.25 year span. There’s no statistically significant difference across these buckets. Before this analysis, I would have suspected that Enterprise-focused companies would have brought in a VPS much earlier, since the sales cycles are long, the stakes are high and a relevant rolodex is valuable at the outset. But this clearly isn’t the case. It is important to note that the Midmarket companies have the greatest variance. I suspect it is because a few of the Midmarket companies have founders and CEOs with sales backgrounds and with that expertise in house, the company can scale well for a year or so more before hiring. While this chart doesn’t show ARR information, we can’t validate the $1M ARR advice. But the data is very consistent with the timing of when a fast-growth company should achieve those revenue numbers. The typical SaaS company will be founded, develop a product, find some customers, raise a seed 9 months later, learn a bit about the sales process, raise a Series A 12 months later and then start a VPS search. And often it’s the cash from this second round that enables the company to afford a VPS and the sales team.

Founded in 1998, Netsuite is worth about $7.7B, making it the sixth largest SaaS compay behind Salesforce, LinkedIn, Workday, ServiceNow and Splunk. Netsuite began developing ERP (enterprise resource planning) tools to help companies manage their finances, expenses and supply chain. Over time, Netsuite has added a few more product lines including ECommerce platform, CRM, business intelligence and a professional services management product. In the last ten years, Netsuite has grown revenue from $18M to $556M. As the company disclosed in their last annual report , Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, owns 47.4% of Netsuite common stock, implying the company is strategically important to Oracle. Over the past decade, Netsuite has grown 37% per year, starting at about 51% in 2005 and in recent years, consistently sustaining 25% annual growth. In 2006, according to the company’s S-1, the business shifted from longer term contracts to one year contracts. Most companies, as they scale, tend to move in the other direction. Netsuite’s revenue per customer averaged $19k in 2008, and $23k in 2009, the last years for which the company provided customer counts. Most ERP systems require substantial configuration. After all, the internal systems of each company vary. Despite customization requirements from customers, Netsuite has maintained professional services revenue at 20% over the life of the company, which is among the highest in the industry , but by no means worrisome. Netsuite operates its professional services division at 0% gross margin - basically at cost - which is in the middle of the pack .  90% of professional services revenue is performed within the first year, implying these fees are paid for customization and training. The combination of high gross margins in software which in 2014 were 85%, and the zero gross margins in professional services average out to 69%, which is right on the median for public SaaS companies. Netsuite is an financially disciplined company, and they understand and can control the underlying drivers of their business well .  As the charts show, the company operates with a goal of 25% annual growth, thereafter maximizing cash, while operating at about -15% net income as percentage of revenue. Netsuite keeps about 14% of revenues as cash. Net income as a percentage of revenue is steady at around -15%. Netsuite’s sales efficiency is below the SaaS median of 0.6 at 0.3, but it has been rising in the last 5 years presumably as the company is able to cross-sell more of its product suite, and also close bigger contracts. The company manages sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue to about 50%, which is in line with the median. Research and development spending is again right on line with the median at 20%. Netsuite consistently achieves its growth goals, and shows the hallmarks of a very well run and disciplined organization. The company’s leadership position in SaaS ERP is undeniable and it’s a great example of how operational discipline can generate enormous businesses, even if the sales efficiency of the business isn’t at the top of the heap.

In response last week’s post on The Fastest Growing Areas of Startup Investment in 2015 , in which Bitcoin topped the list, I received many questions about the underlying dynamics of this startup segment. Which regions? Which stages? How much is going into Bitcoin companies. Using Crunchbase data, I analyzed BTC investment patterns over the past 4 years. The chart above shows that Bitcoin investment started in earnest in 2013. In 2014, total investment spiked to more than $3.5B, and through June 2015 Bitcoin startup have raised more than $4B. This data implies 2015 should be the best year ever for Bitcoin investment. As for stage of investment, I’ve decided that Series A and B are too vague to be meaningful to describe the stages of companies when they raise capital. Instead, I created segments of investment based on round size: < $5M, < $30M and so on. Early stage Bitcoin investment will likely have peaked in 2014, which saw more than 200 sub-$5M investment rounds and about 200 sub-$30M investment rounds. While sub-$5M investment rounds have fallen by 55%, sub-$30M rounds have fallen by 87%. Megarounds have taken their place. Larger than $30M rounds now account for 73% of dollars invested in BTC companies. As the early wave of Bitcoin companies have matured, the early winners are benefitting from a vibrant late stage investment market. In the meantime, it seems, early stage investors are waiting to see how those companies fare. There are many different points of view on the future of Bitcoin. In countries like Argentina , Bitcoin has become a vital part of the daily economy. In the US, BTC has relatively small adoption. Some point to the innovation of the blockchain and the impact this distributed, secure transactional technology will bring to contracts . But it’s still early. I believe that Bitcoin will be a transformational technology. But it will take some time for the innovation to be brought to market in a way that people understand and value. At least for now though, the early winners of the Bitcoin startup sector are finding later stage capital in droves, while the early stage companies face a leaner environment than 2014.

Founders often ask, when is the right time to expand geographically, add a second product or pursue another customer segment? Most of the time, the answer is not yet, not until the company is quite large, perhaps in the hundreds of employees and the main challenges and questions for the business have been answered well. When a startup pursues a new major initiative, the company divides all its key teams by two. If speed and focus are the advantages of startups, then this startup has halved its focus and doubled execution time. There are now two marketing messages, two sales pitches, two press strategies, two product and engineering teams. Rationalizing two messages can be a challenge for companies to communicate and customers to internalize.  For most small companies’ management teams and employees, this doubling of complexity is overwhelming. Second, the company risks slowing its core business. If the company is doing well enough to pursue a second product strategy, the business is onto something. Founders should ask whether faster growth and dominance in one market segment builds a more valuable business than smaller penetration of and slower growth in two markets. Most of the time, and particularly in early stage markets, a focused startup perceived to be on the path to monopolizing a market will be more valuable. Third, the startup’s goals are no longer necessarily aligned among teams. After all, which product takes precedence when cash is constrained, press releases are numbered and customer time is capped? The startup will constantly need to decide which to prioritize - and at early stages, this balancing act is quite a lot to manage. If you chase two rabbits, both will escape. Pick one and seize it.

If there’s one notion that will define the decade early 2010s in startupland, it’s the Megaround, the investments of greater than $40M in private companies. Historically, startups needed to trade on public exchanges to access sums of money from $40M to several billion. But today, the private markets are providing this capital. These billions of dollars, which amount to about half of all venture investment, skew substantially towards consumer investments. The green bar chart above compares how private investors allocate their dollars. Consumer startups fetch 50% of megaround dollars. Software companies collect 40%, then 7% for Infrastructure and 4% for Finance. Let’s contrast these figures with the total US venture investment market. Overall, Software startups win about 60% of dollars, compared to 30% for Consumer, and the remaining two categories account for the remainder. Why do consumer companies command three times as much capital on a relative basis in the later stage private markets than in the market broadly? It’s because the market caps for public consumer startups are 5x larger than their software counterparts. The chart above plots the median market cap for IPOs since 2012 by industry. In the past 3 years, 8 US VC-backed IT consumer companies have gone public and have achieved a $2.5B median market cap ($2.2B if we exclude Facebook). This compares to $400M for software companies, of which there were 32. Though there are some very large software companies (Workday, $15B; ServiceNow, $12B; Splunk, $9B), 14 of the recent IPOs are worth less than $400M as of this writing. One could argue there is a sample bias in the data set. Many of the most attractive companies prefer to raise in the private markets, rather than the publics. But, given how much the private markets seem to favor consumer companies, this bias should depress the consumer figures more than the enterprise ones. In consumer megarounds, logistics companies including Uber, Lyft, Postmates and Shyp collectively have raised more than $7.1B in the last 24 months. Uber accounts for an astonishing $6.1B of that $7.1B. Social media companies like Pinterest and Snapchat follow closely behind. Then AirBnB dominates travel, having raised more than $1B in the last few years. And so on. In software, companies selling to IT have raised the most capital, then marketing, then HR, which is close consistent with software outcomes. . Surprisingly, Sales focused companies trail at the bottom of the list. I suspect this is the consequence of Salesforce’s dominance in the category. In summary, consumer startups raise the near-super-majority of late stage venture dollars. Allured by the promise of 5x larger IPOs, megaround investors pursue these companies aggressively.

As I was researching the theory behind organizational goal-setting , I came across a letter from Hunter Thompson , at the time 20 years old, writing to a friend about goals. Yesterday’s post discussed some frameworks for organizations to craft goals to maximize employee happiness and effectiveness. But Thompson’s advice is for our goals as individuals. To put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES. But don’t misunderstand me. I don’t mean that we can’t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors—but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires—including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter. As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal), he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires). In short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. Thomson articulates beautifully how to enjoy the journey, how to find meaning, something which can be challenging as we are all pursuing the next milestone, the next fund raise, the next $1M in revenue, the next promotion, the next big thing. More than 50 years old, Thomson’s letter conveys a timeless truth: whatever journey we choose, whether heroic fireman, startup founder, venture capitalist or marketer, we must shape our goals to meet our need for fulfillment. We must strive to be ourselves, first and foremost.

Of late, I’ve been having lots of conversations with founders about setting goals. It’s a really important topic for many founders, because it’s the way that management teams align incentives and focus an organization on a few important areas. It’s their focus that enables startups to move quickly, one of their key competitive advantages in the market. But, what is the optimal way of setting goals?
I first learned about goal setting at Google, which employs the OKR (Objective and Key Result) that Andy Grove developed at Intel. He wrote about it in a book called High Output Management. At its core, an OKR is a description of the goal with a quantitative metric of success.
Angus Davis, founder of Swipely, added an important element to the way his company sets OKRs: each goal has to be aligned with the major goal of the business . Often, this type of quarterly goal setting engenders fears of linear thinking and linear progression, which is why many companies encourage their employees to aim to achieve only about 70% of their goals, and many managers at Google, demand that their employees each quarter create a moonshot goal. The likelihood of success of this aspiration is quite low, but if successful, it can meaningfully alter the trajectory of the company. But, there are other frameworks for setting goals. I was chatting with a head of human resources at a fast-growing startup, and he described three different kinds of goals: absolute goals, relative goals, and sustainment goals. Absolute goals are things like revenue, users, employees – numbers that in a fast-growing company are monotonically increasing. Relative goals are things like market share or app rankings. Startup can aim to be in the top 10 mobile apps in a category for example. Sustainment goals are things like 99.999% uptime or 90% customer satisfaction. This executive favored a mix across the three for every individual, because it can be challenging to be motivated exclusively by sustainment goals, for example. Reading through some organizational behavior research, I came across another way of thinking about goals. Elliott and McGregor, two researchers known in the field, categorize goals in three different buckets. Mastery, performance approach, and performance avoidance. Mastery goals are things like becoming fluent in Spanish or in Ruby. They are unique in that the measurement of success is intrinsic, it is up to the individual to compete with themselves to achieve maximum success. Performance approach goals are the most common. Close $1 million new business this year. Generate 1000 new leads this month. Hire six more engineers. Performance approach goals require extrinsic validation, in the form of compensation or bonuses or similar. They work well. The last category according to behavioral research is performance avoidance goals, which asks people to demonstrate that they are not incompetent. Studies of repeatedly shown that these are detrimental and ineffective. And then, there is a host of research on the negative aspects of goals. This Harvard paper outlines all the pitfalls of goal setting: narrow mindedness, learning inhibition, and calibration among others. For example, the Pinto, Ford’s disastrous compact car of the 70s, was a byproduct of focusing on shipping fast, and not paying attention to safety. I had wanted to find some consistent framework for setting goals. But like pricing, there doesn’t seem to be an optimal mechanism of goal setting. The research is still all over the place, and different companies employ different techniques to achieve great success. Ultimately, logic and clear thinking are probably the best tools for setting goals, and motivating an organization properly.

I learned to drive a car at age 19 on a warm Santiago de Chile night, in an unusual way. A friend named Jose Pedro resolved to teach me after dinner at his apartment, suprised to learn I didn’t know how. It was past two am, and without anyone on the streets, it would be safe, he assured me. As we sat in the car, he showed me how to manage the three pedals and the gear shift, and explained the how the clutch worked. Then the lesson started. Jose Pedro instructed me to put the car into first, accelerate gently, then into second, then into third, and then floor it - max the car out. Once we hit top speed in his black Fiat coupe, with the tachometer reaching deep into the red numbers, and the apartment buildings whizzing past, he yelled “¡Frena en seco!” - slam on the brakes. The car pitched forward, the  seat belts cut into our shoulders, the tires squealed and left long trails behind us.  My heart pounding in my ears, my fingers hurt as a I unclenched the steering wheel. Immediately, he turned to me and said, “Now, you know the limits of the car. Everything else should be easy. Just drive within those extremes and you’ll be fine.” I often reminisce about this story when I look at financial plans of startups. The same idea holds: it’s important to understand the limits of a startup in both the acceleration and deceleration cases. When a startup is growing very quickly, the people, the resources and the business will be put under enormous stress. And some point, quicker than expected, the limiting factor of growth will become apparent. Sometimes that limiting factor is cash; the company needs to raise money to seize its opportunity by hiring the right team, staffing sales and customer success. Other times, engineering scalability constrains growth. The product isn’t yet built to handle scale. Yet others, a startup might be hampered by its sales funnel. More leads are needed to achieve plan. Often, through financial modeling and introspection, startups can anticipate this limiting factor and plan to mitigate it early. That’s the acceleration part.  And founders will have to do this again and again and again. Because each time a limiting factor is managed, another one pops up. A startup should be prepared to handle the deceleration case, for example, when it hasn’t discovered product market fit, is running out of cash, or suffering from a degrading macroeconomic environment. The company should understand how fast it can slow its growth to reach cash flow break even and profitability, while still remaining in control of its business. This might imply reducing marketing spend, curtailing hiring, accelerating cash collections, cutting expenses. What would that look like? Does the company have enough capital to sustain deceleration? Understanding the limits of your startup, and operating within them, is critical to ensuring long term success.

In Q2 2015, VC investment totaled $16.7B, about a 66% of the $28B deployed in Q2 2000 according to a new report . And the trends shows no sign of stopping. A big contributor to this growth are nontraditional investors including mutual funds and hedge funds, which now account for approximately 40% of dollars invested. And while the market is similar to the dotcom era in some regards, it is substantially different in others. Amazingly, each of the last four quarters of venture investment from Q3 2014 to Q2 2015, are in the top 10 all-time for venture capital investment. However, the number of investments per quarter is about half of 2000. Combined with the chart above, this implies that fewer startups are raising substantially larger rounds. It also implies that there are probably winner-take-most or similar dynamics in many different industries. Category leaders stockpile massive war chests, creating a defensive moat. Sure enough, the data shows that the average investment size in Q2 2015 is $14.7M exceeding the $13.1M figure of Q2 2015. In other words, the typical round raised by startups has never been larger. Looking at this data by stage, average series A investments and series B investments are the largest ever been at about $10M and $20M respectively, adjusted for inflation. Later rounds are approaching all-time highs, but have not eclipsed them yet, despite about ten $1 billion plus equity raises in the last 12 to 18 months. As average investment sizes have increased, and valuations with them, investors have moved earlier in response. Unlike the dotcom era, this time series Bs and series Cs have remained constant in number, while series As have doubled since 2005. Interestingly, seed round volumes have not increased substantially, but this may be an artifact of the way the NVCA collects its data. When looking at the data by sector, we see that consumer products and services and financial services companies raise on average the largest rounds. Financial services companies on average in Q2 raised north of $30 million. This is largely skewed by handful of outliers. Consumer products and services also reach close to $20 million. As the amount of money investors pile into startups starts to reach the levels of the dotcom era, the data shows that while there are some similarities, there also some meaningful differences. This time, investors are pursuing series As more aggressively than they have previously, likely to mitigate the increasing valuations in the market. There is also substantially more concentration in the smaller set of startups. So investors are focusing on the perceived winners of categories.

When asked why he took Zendesk public this week, CEO Mikkel Svane replied , “At some point you have to move out of your parent’s basement.” It’s a witty quip with some truth to it. Evolving into a public company is a step for about 25-30 venture backed IT companies per year, and it can be a worthwhile, if strenuous, journey. Zendesk went public in the midst of a 30% reduction in SaaS multiples in the public markets , and the company has continued to perform well. Because of the demands of public market investors, publicly traded companies must operate with greater discipline than most private companies. I don’t mean to imply that there aren’t terrifically well run private companies. Bloomberg, provider of the eponymous financial information terminals, generates roughly $10B annually in subscription revenues, and is wildly profitable. But the demands of being a public company are stringent. Startups on the path to IPO must prepare for a year or more, learning new disciplines in finance, corporate communications and operations. In finance, the company must develop an ability to forecast and achieve quarterly financial targets. The business must perform a thorough audit for several years in the past, and implement financial controls on spending. And many of the business’ key metrics are exposed for the first time. Corporate communications must be organized and efforts coordinated to ensure statements don’t violate SEC disclosure rules, for example. There also can be an emotional component to going public for a company. Unlike private companies who may perform a 409a valuation on the business every 6-12 months, shares of publicly traded companies are marked to market every day. Sometimes, companies bear large swings in share prices in short periods of time, that increase and decrease the market cap of the business, even though the core business hasn’t changed. And increasingly, some public companies must wrestle with activist shareholders who according to a recent study increase a company’s focus on short term performance , which can be a challenge when looking to manage a business with a long term time horizon. Incidentally, this is the reason Google created a new type of share called Class C in 2014 that lacks voting rights, so activists couldn’t influence the company. There can be substantial benefits to going public. The new disciplines learned can lead to a better run organization. Employee option/share liquidity rewards early employees and provides a new and enticing compensation tool for recruitment. But, like moving out of the basement, there are some new things to learn and some growing pains, too.

Earlier this week, we examined the trends in the major categories of startup investment including eCommerce, Software, Social Networking and Education. But which lesser known startup sectors are starting to raise venture dollars? Where are founders finding unique opportunities to innovate? Bitcoin is the fastest growing sector followed by photo sharing and physical storage (which includes moving and self storage companies). Each year, starting in mid-2012 through mid-2015, these sectors have grown their investment dollars by more than 145%, according to Mattermark data. The rest of the list controverts the notion that startups and investors pursue only incremental innovations. Space travel startups look to conquer the final frontier. In addition, founders have raised capital to transform many of the fundamental industries: transportation, hospitality, lending, health insurance, and banking. But, photosharing, inevitably, continues to grow quickly, too. If we examine the relative share of dollars raised in the last 12 months by each of these categories, we observe that quite a few like bitcoin, physical storage, drones and classifieds represent a minuscule fraction of the total invested dollars - less than 20 basis points. Others, like transportation and hospitality, fueled by Uber and AirBnB fundraising efforts, command more than 6% of the billions invested in the last 12 months. Let’s look at the sectors with negative growth rates, where startups are raising less money over time. Semiconductor investment fell 31% per year. Email startups raised 22% less. Dating contracted by 9% annually. And the worst performing category: deal sites, whose total raised fell by 48% per year. In some cases, the causes for contraction in these categories is evident. Groupon dominates the deal market, and so room for new entrants is scarce. Semiconductor startups are constrained by a very small number of foundries who can manufacture their equipment, and compete with incumbents like Intel and TSMC, whose massive balance sheets can finance cutting edge research. Email and dating’s decline are less obvious. Nevertheless, we should continue to see a greater variance in areas of startup investment over the next few years. As the total amount of venture capital rockets toward historic records, founders will pursue areas of lesser competition, where differentiation is easier consequently creating an advantage for the company when recruiting talent and raising capital. In addition, investors will seek under-explored areas to finance, looking for great returns.

“People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.” This line from Simon Sinek’s TED talk captures the power of a values based marketing campaign. Simon contrasts feature-based marketing - start with what the company is selling continue to how they do it and finishes with why - to value based campaigns which reverse the story-telling order. Values campaigns start with the why. Starting with why is a simple but powerful framework for startups to develop a unique marketing message, particularly in a competitive marketplace. Starting with why focuses  on values which are difficult to emulate, not features which can be copied. Without question product differentiation matters, but it may not suffice in a world where “Customers, generally speaking, see significantly less difference between us and the competition than we do ourselves. It’s not that they think most suppliers are particularly bad on brand, product, or service. It’s just that [customers] don’t think [suppliers are] particularly different.” Source: CEB Apple embodies starting with why. No surprise, then, that Apple owns the most powerful brand in technology. There’s no better example than the 1997 Think Different campaign whose narrative embraces a set of values and in so doing, inspires us: Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. Which other computer company embraces rebels? And how many millions identify with that espirit ? And once Apple has done it, it’s impossible for any competitor to copy the strategy without being regarded as a pretender. Similarly, inside each Moleskine notebook, a small, embossed card tells the buyer that a nearly identical journal captured the creative genius of Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Ernest Hemingway. No other notebook can claim that. That card has mooted the traditional competitive axes of cost, size, and paper quality. There are many other eminent consumer brands who start with why, like Virgin and Nike. While there are fewer in enterprise software, some do exist. Salesforce’s iconoclastic “No Software” moniker tops the list. As Marc Benioff describes in this blog post , he started with why: A brand is a company’s most important asset. A company can’t “own” its facts. If the company’s facts (speed, price, quality) are superior to the competition, any good competitor will duplicate them, or worse, improve upon them, as soon as possible. What a company can own, however, is a personality. We own NO SOFTWARE—not because we are the only one doing it but because we were the first to think it was important to customers. By consistently delivering an attitude that is future focused and pioneering, we have created a personality. Starting with why is the Challenger Sale , the most effective sales technique, in a different form. The challenger sale provokes prospective customers to think differently about what they are buying, to focus on something other than features, namely values. And that marketing and positioning, when well executed, uniquely positions a company to win by creating an unreplicable advantage. This marketing technique applies to competition, hiring, fund raising, and every important sales process for a startup. It’s an invaluable skill to master.

In the last six months, VCs have invested more than $57B according to Mattermark data , which puts 2015 on pace to exceed 2000 as the year the most venture capital will be deployed, ever. Which sectors are benefitting from all these venture dollars? The chart above contrasts the top 12 sectors receiving venture funding in the US, and plots the relative share of dollars invested by month. The red line indicates the monthly data point, the thin blue line shows a linear regression trend line, and the shadow around the blue line is the area of standard error. Sectors receiving an increasing amount of investment include biotechnology, financial technology, healthcare, and social networking. Meanwhile, analytics and commerce companies are raising less as a fraction of total dollars than they have in the past. If we compare the seed investment patterns to the growth investment patterns, a few other trends pop out of the data. For example, although eCommerce companies raise more than 15% of the seed dollars in the past 12 months, the sector has raised a smaller share - 11% of growth investments. In contrast, enterprise software companies punch below their weight in seed investments, but above their weight in growth dollars. Most striking is the disparity with marketing and education companies who fetch substantial seed investment dollars but see only about 1/3 as many growth dollars - indicating differences in preference of the early and later stage markets.  The converse is true for analytics companies. This data shows which sectors are coming into and out of vogue with investors. Unfortunately, it doesn’t reveal which sectors will generate the best returns, or in which sector the next great startup will be built!

In every sales process for every SaaS startup, there is one ultimate internal champion advocating the purchasing decision. And it’s their budget that will be used to pay for it. So, which departments within customers spend most on SaaS? One way of looking at this question is to compare the successes of software companies targeting different departments. I have categorized the 50 or so publicly traded SaaS companies by their principal buyer, and tallied the aggregate market caps of those companies above. Software companies targeting Human Resources and Sales teams are in aggregate each worth about $50B. Next, companies targeting IT are worth approximately $40B. After that there’s a steep decline to about $10B for Finance and Marketing. Company Category Share of MC Salesforce Sales 92% Zendesk CS 77% New Relic Eng 67% NetSuite Finance 62% LinkedIn HR 53% As the table above shows, the Sales category is dominated by Sales force, which represents 92% of the market capitalization in that category. It is a bit unfair to lump all of Salesforce’s revenue into sales because the product spans sales, marketing and support. Nevertheless, the majority of the revenue remains from sales teams. The next most dominant company in a category is Zendesk which represents 77% of the Customer Support/Success market cap today. Then there is New Relic, NetSuite, and LinkedIn all about 50% of their categories. How should these trends change with time?  I suspect sales will always be in the top one or two categories, because if software enables a sales team to be more productive, and it is ROI positive, then there’s always the case to be made to buy it. The same is true for Human Resources. Companies are always looking to hire, and tools that provide them competitive advantage in recruitment can be very well justified. Surprisingly, Marketing is on the smaller end of the spectrum. Gartner has forecasted that by 2017 CMOs will spend more money than CIOs , which should eventually translate to substantial increases in the aggregate market caps of marketing SaaS companies. The Engineering and Customer Success categories are both relatively new. It’s only recently that the consumerization of IT has led to substantial spending on tools by engineering teams. One blind spot in this analysis is it fails to look at the total value of SaaS acquisitions .  If we were look only at the top six, they would add about $50B or so to the data set.  out of the top six largest acquisitions, three of them are for Human resources companies: Taleo ($1.8B), Kenexa ($1.3B) and SuccessFactors ($3.6B), so this data would likely only further skew the existing results in favor of HR. These historical trends are interesting, but it’s very difficult to use them to predict the future. And, after all there are quite a few fast-growing software companies scaling very quickly that should go public in the next few years that could meaningfully skew this data.

According to ChiefMarTec, in 2015 there are 1875 marketing technology companies, up from 947 last year . If the number of marketing software companies is any indication, there is a huge expansion in the number of SaaS companies in almost every segment including sales tools, engineering productivity, finance, and human resources. This fragmentation trend has been happening for quite some time. In the old model of software procurement, companies would call one of the large software monoliths (Oracle, SAP, IBM, etc) and negotiate an enterprisewide license for a software suite to serve the majority of their departments. These suite offerings promised simplified negotiation and procurement, a single integrated platform with free data interchange across departments, and one point of support. But, this promise was never fulfilled. For example, according to a recent study by Panorama Consulting Solutions , the average ERP implementation requires 16 months to deploy and 20% of them are considered failures. The alternative, which is the fragmented market of today, enables teams to purchase best-of-breed point solutions, try them, and quickly cycle through all the different offerings until they find the best one for their needs. This change in purchasing behavior is happening broadly across SaaS. If you speak to a VP of Sales a fast-growing startup, you often hear them talk about their sales stack,  the collection of different software their account executive views. It’s not just CRM that salespeople use anymore, but sales orchestration, lead generation, configure price quote software, and so on. The marketing team also has their proprietary software stack with marketing automation, lead scoring, attribution, and many other categories. So does human resources: applicant tracking, employee engagement, goal setting… These department specific software stacks serve their customers much better than a single suite ever could, because each team in each company can select precisely the products that offer the features that meet their specific needs.  and if requirements should change, it’s as simple as canceling a subscription, and starting  with another product. Data mobility enables these department software stacks to exist. While the monolithic software suite  never fulfilled their promise of easy data movement across different applications, point solutions do because many of them have robust APIs which allow bilateral integrations, and the enterprise middleware companies like Segment and Tray and Zapier. Plus, these integrations scale, unlike the bespoke data exchange of suites. Integrate once with Salesforce, and all customers benefit. There are of course downsides to the highly fragmented software ecosystem. It becomes more more difficult for individual vendors to differentiate in a sea of competitors. Startups may find it increasingly challenging to win a disproportionate share of the market. In addition, best-of-breed solutions have to compete suites who often discount aggressively. For example, every independent marketing automation company has to compete with Salesforce offering Pardot to all their customers. But these are tractable challenges in the market that values piecing together an optimal software stack. At least for the moment, I expect to see further and further fragmentation in the software landscape, enabled by APIs.

About two years ago, we examined the new Second Seed , a tactic employed by startups who raise an initial seed round, achieve a set of milestones and raise a second seed round, before raising a series A.  During the two years since that analysis, this trend has continued. In the last 24 months, Second Seeds have grown  From 7.5% to 18% of US technology seed rounds, both in number and in dollars invested according to Crunchbase data. And this growth in share is doubly impressive because the overall number of seats has been growing at about 49% annually. Second Seeds have been growing at twice that rate at 94%. Second seed rounds historically have been larger than First Seed rounds. In 2015, the median Second Seed round hit $1 million compared to $800k for First Seeds. However, there is no statistical difference between the two. In other words, second seeds are not always larger than first seeds. The box plot above shows the changing distribution of second seeds by size. While the median remains relatively constant, the number of outliers, marked by dots, has increased. The chart indicates that in some cases, second seeds are Series A by another name. Interestingly, there are no investors in the Crunchbase data set that focus exclusively on second seeds. In other words, Second Seed dollars are provided by First Seed investors. This is probably because Second Seeds are most often invested in companies that are doing well, but need a little bit more capital to reach the milestones to raise a substantial series A. So, the existing investors, possibly in addition to one or two other seed investors, double down on the business to see it through. The first chart which shows the increasing concentration of the seed market in Second Seeds supports this hypothesis. Once a startup indicates some initial success, existing investors seek to buy more of the business. In addition, the 9 month difference between the first and second seed rounds, a difference that has been increasing over the past three years, supports the idea that Second Seeds are used to continue to develop momentum before the Series A. Whatever you call the Second Seed, I suspect it’s a financial product that is here to stay. Representing almost a fifth of the seed market, it’s also likely to become increasingly common.

This time last year, I analyzed the state of the startup acquisition market . Two key trends surfaced. First, the larger acquisitions were becoming larger. Second, that the total number of acquisitions in 2014 would achieve a 5 year high. As of mid-2015, the first trend continues while the second seems to have faltered. The median acquisition price for technology companies in Crunchbase’s data set is plotted above, bucketed by size. For example, the $500M bucket marked in yellow includes all acquisitions between $100M and $500M. Startups haven’t seen any increase in the median value an acquirer pays over the five year period. However, at the top end of the spectrum, companies sold for $500M or more, has increased 40% over the last five years from $1.25B to $1.75B. Premium startups are fetching higher premiums than in recent history. Many technology incumbents possess substantial cash balances , which enable them to make substantial acquisitions. But M&A velocity has slowed in 2015 compared to 2014 - at least through the first quarter. The chart above plots the quarterly number of acquisitions, again by size. Q3 and Q4 of 2014 saw record high activity over the last five year period. 2015 Q1 activity, meanwhile, has declined. With these changes in the acquisition market, the relative share of acquisitions has evolved, too. $100-$500M acquisitions are now the most common, displacing the $0-50M. This may be because fewer smaller acquisitions are disclosed, or it may highlight the waning of the acquihire era, a time in Startupland when large incumbents acquired startups at substantial premiums, principally for their talent, rather than technology or revenue. On the whole, 2015 has seen a decline in M&A activity, though premium companies do command higher prices than before. Coincidentally, venture backed startup IPOs have also seen a weak first quarter . It’s hard to say why M&A and IPO activity have seen declines in 2015. I suspect a big contributor may be the availability of venture and growth capital. Why sell the business if it’s easy to raise capital to grow it and make it even more valuable?

Ultimately, the goal of most content marketing campaigns is email address capture. When a reader decides to receive content consistently via email, a content marketer knows they’re developing a deeper relationship with that person. Whether the marketers selling software or venture capital, retaining an email address is a victory. In the last 18 months, this blog has grown its email subscriber list from zero to roughly 8000 subscribers, and lost about 1000, meaning the current distribution list is about 7k. Over the weekend, I tried to understand the general behavior of unsubscribes. The chart above that over the last 18 months,  1064 people have unsubscribed. 24% unsubscribe within the first 30 days, 40% within the first 60 days, 50% within the first 90 days. I’m not sure why people unsubscribe within the first 90 days, but it’s probably worth surveying them to get a better sense of the cause. If you have a point of view, please let me know on Twitter. Interestingly, there’s no correlation between the day of the week and a number of unsubscribes. Sunday has a much smaller unsubscribe rate, but that simply because the data set is much smaller. I don’t write on Sundays. Note, the unsubscribe rate here is a campaign rate – meaning the number of people who receive an email from a blog post and choose to unsubscribe. However, time of day is a huge factor in unsubscribe behaviors. 66% of unsubscribes occur between 5 and 10PM. Perhaps this is the time we’re all cleaning up our email inboxes and opting out of the content that isn’t useful for us. If nothing else, it’s a good reminder that sending emails out in the morning is likely a better time than late in the day. The next step in this analysis is to understand the particular details of blog post content that trigger unsubscribes. If you have thoughts on how to improve this blog and its email newsletter, please send me an email at ttunguz@redpoint.com or a tweet at @ttunguz. I’d really appreciate it.

When startups achieve hyper-growth, many of the key internal processes begin to fail under the strain of a newer, larger organization. So they must be reinvented. One of the most important internal processes, but least considered, is scheduling meetings. As Anne Dillard wrote, “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” Most of us spend our days in meetings. Meetings, like a snowball rolling down a mountain, develop ever greater inertia, roll down a path of their own - different from their initial purpose - and ensnare increasing numbers people as a business grows. To counter this effect, James Reinhart and the team at ThredUp , a clothing marketplace metamorphosing through hypergrowth, slashed and burned their calendars. On a chosen weekend, everyone at ThredUp deleted every standing and recurring meeting in their agendas. During the next few days, the team questioned what meetings should exist, who ought to attend them, and what their agendas and goals should be. In addition, the team pushed to cut meeting times in half from 50 to 25 minutes. The impact to the company has been dramatic. Fewer, shorter, more productive meetings. After all, if a 100 person startup eliminates one 1 hour standing meeting each week from every employee’s calendar, they will have unlocked more than an extra manyear of work to allocate - a new “free” employee. Slashing and burning calendars periodically challenges a company to allocate its most scarce resource, employees’ time, more effectively. By torching all the scheduling chaff that accumulates over time, startups can start fresh and cultivate a schedule to maximize company and employee performance (and happiness).

One smart SaaS entrepreneur told me last week he prefers bottoms up businesses to top-down companies because bottoms up sales and marketing efforts enable startups to pursue hundreds of paths into a company. Unlike top down sales processes which offer a startup one shot at closing an account (a meeting with a CEO or VP), for bottoms up products, each employee is a credit-card-carrying-decision-maker. As the number of total potential buyers expands, so does the universe of sales processes. And because each sales process is targeted to an individual, the sales cycles are much shorter. Combined, these two attributes of bottoms-up sales models permit startups to AB test and iterate their marketing and sales tactics much more quickly. Each experiment in marketing collateral or sales pitch reaches statistical significance in weeks, not months or years. Bottoms up businesses also have another beautiful trait - they lead with their product. After marketing educates and interests potential users , the product and engineering team’s effort must shine during trial to entice a user to convert to paid. A startup can measure their effectiveness through the signup to paid flow, and again experiment their way to success. Last, in bottoms up sales processes, customer success teams become critical contributors to the product roadmap. Daily, customer success teams hear and understand the challenges users face, and report them to the product team. In a top down model, the sales team often is responsible for relaying this feedback, which sometimes leads to feature building to satisfy the needs of one particular client, often a member of the leadership team, not the true end user. Through experimentation and analysis, bottoms up SaaS companies can quickly spin a customer acquisition flywheel that can be used to generate enough business to grow a business very quickly.

As Fred Wilson wrote over the weekend , Janet Yellen, the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Fed), indicated last week that the Fed would likely increase the federal funds rate ,  which has hovered around zero for the last seven years -  since the collapse of Lehman. In the last 35 years, the federal funds rate has varied from as high as 16% in 1981 to as low as 0.09%. throughout those cycles, venture capital has flourished from a cottage industry into $100B per year asset class. VCs are on track to invest as much capital this year as during the height of the dot com era. But, is there any observable relationship between the federal funds rate and the startup ecosystem? The chart above shows the federal funds rate starting in 2000 through 2015, compared to the dollars in billions of venture capital investment. From 2000 through 2009, the federal funds rate and venture investment paralleled each other.  At the height of the bubble, interest rates were relatively high. When the technology bubble crashed, the Fed pursued a strategy of reducing interest rates in order to spur growth. Because venture capitalists viewed the environment is less rosy than before, and limited partners  also invested less in venture capital, the amount of venture capital investment declined with rates. When the economy started to pick up steam again, rates increased and so did venture capital investment. But, since the start of quantitative easing, the relationship no longer holds. Separately, there’s no strong relationship between the Fed Funds rate and exits. See the chart for IPOs and M&A . As for the impact on valuations, the plot above shows the average investment across all rounds over the same timeframe, compared to the federal funds rate. It would be hard to draw any kind of relationship between these two trends. We do know however, that the recent spike in average investment size is driven in large part by the growth of mega rounds , and the influx of capital from nontraditional venture capitalists, whose investments now account for about 40% of dollars . This non-traditional capital from mutual funds and hedge funds and other financial investors is the capital source most likely to be affected by short-to medium-term changes in interest rates. Unlike traditional VCs, whose investors commit to 10 year funds for investment in startups, nontraditional investors can invest across a broad range of different asset classes, and can quickly decide to invest their dollars elsewhere. If these late stage investors were to leave the market, growth multiples would likely contract as the supply of investment dollars would decline. But, it’s impossible to say how long such a decline would take, or predict the magnitude of such a change. The data indicates movements in the Fed Funds Rate aren’t predictive of startup investment. So, changes in the fed funds rate aren’t likely to have an immediate impact on startups and their ability to fund raise. But at some point, the fund raising market dynamics will change, and the canary in the coalmine are the late stage investors whose dollars aren’t constrained to/focused on startups.

When deciding to open source software, one of the key questions teams must answer is the license under which they will distribute their software. There are a wide variety of different alternatives. But, the three most common are GPL, Apache and MIT. I was curious if there was any relationship between type of license used by startup commercializing open source software, and their ability to raise capital, and exit. Black Duck Software,  a company which scans code bases to find open source software to make sure they are properly licensed, releases a survey each year of the top 20 licenses used in open source projects . License Share GPL Family 42% MIT 20% Apache 16% Developers chose the GPL family of licenses in 42% of projects compared to 20% for the MIT license and 16% for Apache. However, looking at the chart above, we can see that Apache projects raise a disproportionate amount of capital, compared to their share of open-source projects. Apache licensed projects represent only 16% of the number of projects, but they account for more than 50% of venture dollars raised to commercialize those projects. In large part, this figure is driven by companies commercializing Hadoop, namely Cloudera, Hortonworks and MapR. The MIT license punches below its weight.  Developers chose the MIT license for 20% of code repositories, but commercial entities of MIT projects raised less than 1% of venture dollars. GPL licenses projects represent 42% of projects and 37% of dollars. In terms of exits, including both acquisition and IPO, GPL licensed projects dominate, having generated more than $6 billion in liquidity, compared to $2B for Apache projects. In part, this could be due to the fact that the GPL license predates the Apache license by 10 years, (1989 vs 2000). In fact, the three largest open source acquisitions , Sourcefire ($2.4B), Novell ($2.1B), MySQL ($1.0B) were all GPL licensed projects. MySQL and Novell were founded before the Apache license was written (1979 and 1995). Given the revenues being generated by the Hadoop vendors and other commercialization startups of Apache projects like Cassandra,  it’s very likely the next five years we will see Apache licenses is catching up to GPL licenses in exit value. While there are some substantive differences between the licenses in terms of IP rights, which I won’t dive into in this post, it seems that there isn’t a very strong correlation between a startup’s open source license and its ultimate success. Apache projects, which on the whole are newer, have raise more capital, but because they are newer, haven’t yet contributed substantially to returns. Ultimately, the key drivers of success for startups commercializing open source projects will likely live in their ability to create defensible and sustainable business models  in some fashion on free software.

There’s a “new” $4B startup today. A consumer hardware company called FitBit started trading on the Nasdaq this morning and it’s an impressive success story. We’ve examined the tremendous revenue growth GoPro experienced in a previous post . Impressively, FitBit is growing faster. As the chart above shows, FitBit grew from $14M to $76M to $271M to $745M in revenue in four years, generating astounding growth rate of 170% per year. Of late, FitBit ’s growth rate has begun to outpace GoPro’s growth rate. FitBit, which sells a range of fitness trackers at around $100 price point, operates at roughly the same gross margin (50%) as GoPro, though FitBit’s margins are rising, while GoPro’s are flat. Impressively, FitBit spends about 10% points less in sales and marketing than GoPro to achieve a faster growth rate. And the company invests less in Research and Development. GoPro’s R&D spend has increased of late, presumably driven by increasing competition in the marketplace, forcing the company to develop differentiated products. This is a challenge that FitBit also faces from Apple’s Watch and other fitness trackers. And, in terms of cash, both companies are operating at roughly the same level: roughly 1 to 3% cash from operations as a percentage of revenue. In summary, both FitBit and GoPro have created massive consumer hardware companies that sustain incredible growth rates while generating profits. Both companies have faced substantial competitive pressure to differentiate their products, and outmarket and outsell their competition. These two companies are among the first winners in the venture-backed consumer hardware world, a trend that is very likely to continue.

Open Source Software started the movement in the late 1990s. Since then, open source software has transformed the software industry. Today, many infrastructure software startups employ open source strategies to market their software and win dominant market share. Open source is a disruptive distribution strategy. It allows potential users and buyers of a software to try it, evaluate it, and understand exactly how it works because the source code is freely available. Open source companies market to developers exactly how developers would like to be marketed to - with code. Once many people are using an open source software, startups generate revenue in a variety of different ways, either charging for services and support of the open source software or developing closed source or premium features that enterprises are willing to pay for.One of the most interesting newer models is open source SaaS. As a result of both the disruptive nature of open source distribution, and the changes in buyer preferences, the number of open source financings has increased nearly monotonically since the genesis of the movement, and it shows no signs of slowing. In 2014, venture capitalists invested in 37 separate open-source financings. Some open source companies have raised huge sums of money, well over $100 million. The chart above shows the top 10 open source companies in terms of dollars raised. Three of the top 10 companies are filesystem companies commercializing Hadoop (Cloudera, Hortonworks, MapR). Two of the companies are database companies (MongoDB and Datastax). Mulesoft is a data movement company. Kaltura provides video rendering software. So, it’s plain to see that open source software companies are playing in many software and infrastructure categories. VC interest in new open-source software is motivated by substantial exits. The chart above shows the top 10 open source acquisitions. SourceFire, Novell and MySQL have all been worth $900 million or more, in three separate categories of software: security, operating systems, and databases. Company Market Cap, $B Revenue, $M Gross Margin, % RedHat 14.5 1,790 85 HortonWorks 1.1 46 -75 In addition, there are two publicly traded open-source companies, RedHat and Hortonworks, both which are worth more than $1 billion. RedHat is worth 14.4 billion,  making it more valuable than Splunk and ServiceNow, and just about the same as WorkDay. However, these companies couldn’t be more different in terms of gross margin profile. While Red Hat operates at  85% gross margin, which is better than most SaaS companies, Hortonworks recorded a negative gross margin last year, because of the significant amount of revenue derived from professional services which are sold at a loss to the company to win market share. While many companies do distribute software via open source,  these businesses can employ radically different business models and consequently have contrasting financial profiles. I’m certain we’ll see quite a few more open-source software companies. While the movement has been around for more than 15 years, the opportunity before these kinds of businesses has never been larger.  There more developers than there have ever been. Companies of all kinds are starting to use software as competitive strategic advantage, and the pace of innovation in infrastructure and software continues to increase.

Financial discipline is a hallmark of great companies. It’s what enables businesses to build exceptional go to market models, weather difficult times, and ultimately succeed. Sometimes, financial discipline in startups is imposed by financial markets, like in 2008 when the total amount of venture capital investment plummeted after Lehman imploded. Other times, financial discipline is imposed by founders and management teams. The tweet above is from Lew Cirne, founder and CEO of New Relic, a $1.5B market cap company serving developers, who deliberately raised small arounds at the outset of the company to impose financial discipline on his business. In other words, Lew valued patience with unit economics. When it’s easy for startups to raise capital, there is an easy way to solve most problems: hire more people. When the sales team needs more leads, hire more marketers. When the engineering team has fallen a bit behind in the roadmap, hire more developers. When the product team hasn’t designed the product well, hire more customer success managers. This human capital Band-Aid strategy is expensive and won’t scale, unless the company continuously raises large sums of money. Mark Roberge, Chief Revenue Officer at Hubspot, recently shared with me how he instill patience in unit economics in his teams. He has three go to market principles: Adopt before you buy -  develop a bottoms up product that people can try out and ultimately upgrade themselves without having to contact sales or support Product before people -  focus on improving the product before hiring additional customer support or salespeople. The product has to stand on its own. Individual before team -  The initial product experience should focus on the individual or single player experience first, and the broader team second. As Hubspot is a bottoms up business, these principles makes sense. Focus on making sure the product is as efficient as possible moving potential customers through the funnel, minimize human interaction, in order to maximize margin. In addition, Mark also has a best practice with the sales teams. After all, it’s common practice to settle a reasonable quota for sales teams and simply add more reps to scale growth. In contrast, Mark uses his sales teams’ performance to determine how quickly he grows the sales team.
For example, a startup employing Mark’s strategy might have a $4k MRR quota for its five person sales team. The VP of sales would then tell the existing sales team, if they exceed $4.5k MRR quota next month, there won’t be any incremental hires. And the quota then increase the next month to $5.0k, and so on until the team can no longer meet the target. This strategy stretches the sales teams to become more and more efficient through better qualification, sales process improvements, feedback product and so on. Salespeople ought to be motivated to limit the size of the sales team to ensure each individual has access to the best leads. Given this constraint, the sales team and the product team are aligned to figure out ways of scaling the sales process, and developing better efficiencies than previously thought possible. Having the patience to develop compelling unit economics is one of the hardest things to do in a startup, particularly in an environment where capital is cheap and problems can be solved simply by hiring. But, this discipline enables companies to grow exceptionally quickly and capital efficiently in up markets and in down markets. It’s also a huge competitive advantage. Mark Roberge and Lew Cirne have created some exceptional examples to learn from.

Compensation structures are one of the most interesting questions facing customer success organizations in software startups. How should customer success leaders structure their team’s compensation in order to align the objectives of individual customer success managers with those of the larger business? At the Customer Success Summit, Boaz Maor, VP of Customer Success at Mashery presented his rubric for answering this question . I have copied his table below. Management Objective Examples Weight Product Adoption Consistency of feature usage, the fraction of active seats 10% Program Expansion New use of other product features and services; new department using product 15% Value to Customer Is the customer measuring ROI from our product? How compelling is the ROI? 20% Relationship Weekly or monthly update calls with relationship owner; occasional calls with executive champion 15% Non-Monetary Value Customer willing to provide  references and/or case study; customer sends referrals 20% Monetary Value Identify a number of leads for upsell, contract renewal rate 20% At Mashery, customer success managers are  evaluated on five different objectives: product adoption, program expansion, value to customer/ROI, strength of the relationship, non-monetary value, and monetary value. Each field has a corresponding weight, used to calculate the ultimate bonus for the CSM. Like sales compensation plans , customer success compensation plans should evolve to serve the business’s needs.  Using a rubric like this, Mashery’s management team could, for example, decide that in the next six months, upsells of existing customers are the most important strategic priority. So Boaz might increase the weight of the Monetary Value component, and in particular the identification of upsell leads. Additionally, a structured compensation plan like the one used by Mashery clearly communicates the expectations to each individual customer success manager. So it can be a great management tool.

As I prepared the S-1 analysis for ServiceNow, the third largest public SaaS company in the world , I came across a section in their latest annual report called Key Factors Affecting Our Performance in which the company describes the two ways they evaluate churn. One is common, but another is unusual. Below I’ve quoted their definitions. Upsell rate. To grow our business it is important for us to generate additional sales from existing customers, which we refer to as our upsell rate. We calculate our upsell rate as the annualized contract value, or ACV, of upsells, net of losses during the period, divided by our total ACV signed during the period. The upsell rate was 36%, 31% and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our upsells are primarily derived by an increase in the number of seat licenses purchased by our customers and are also derived from the addition of other subscription services. Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the ACV from lost customers, divided by the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period and from all lost customers… Our renewal rate was 97%, 96% and 97% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Upsell rate is the calculation of the dollar retention or negative net churn figure , and is commonly used by SaaS startups. While it’s a great metric, using upsell rate alone to judge the health of the business can lead to false conclusions. For example, if one massive customer buys more seats, the upsell rate will look great, at better than 100%. But if the company is losing 10% of the rest of its customer base each month, the startup is in trouble. So, in addition to dollar retention, startups will often calculate unit retention, as a way of seeing past the effects of large customers on dollar retention.
But the unit figure has some problems, particularly if a startup has a very diverse customer base with lots of smaller customers, who will churn at very high rates, and depress the unit retention. ServiceNow’s renewal rate is a great replacement for unit renewal. It’s a metric of revenue retention that doesn’t allow large customer upsells to mask customer churn, and it conveys the health of the broad base of the business. As described above, to calculate renewal rate, use this formula: Renewal_Rate = 100% - Lost_ACV/(Lost_ACV + Total_Renewed_ACV) where ACV is annual contract value. Consider adding renewal rate to your SaaS startup’s key metrics. It’s another terrific diagnostic tool to understand the health of your customer base.

Worth $11.5B, ServiceNow is the third public SaaS company, after Salesforce and LinkedIn. Based in San Diego, ServiceNow employs roughly 3000 people, and sells  a system of record for IT operations teams to manage IT assets,  facilities, and human resources. ServiceNow’s software allows clients to develop custom applications for their own needs, often with the help of the company’s professional services team. The business was founded in 2004, but hit its stride 2009 and went public in 2012. ServiceNow grew from$19M in revenue to $178M in 4 years, sustaining a 75% CAGR during that period. Compared to other SaaS companies, ServiceNow is among the top 3 fastest growing, and isn’t showing any signs of slowing. At IPO, ServiceNow recorded a $95,000 average revenue per customer, placing in the top third of SaaS companies in terms of average revenue per customer. But that figure has increased dramatically over the past four years. Since 2011, the average revenue of a ServiceNow customer has expanded to $250,000 on average. This figure has grown by 27% per year. ServiceNow has moved up-market aggressively, nearly tripling the number of million-dollar-plus customers from 37 to 129 in the last three years. In addition, the company has grown its base of customers substantially. ServiceNow reports its   upsell rate, which is equivalent to a negative net churn. ServiceNow commands 30%+ annual price increases from its customers, an impressive figure. This ability to upsell and cross sell customers has benefited the company tremendously. ServiceNow has recorded a better than 1.0 sales efficiency for every year on record but 2014. amazingly, the company was able to achieve an estimated sales efficiency of 1.8 at $93M in revenue. Impressively,  the company is investing more and more into engineering - exceeding 20% of revenues last year - likely developing broader feature set to enable additional up and cross sells. Gross margins hover in the 60s which is about 10 percentage points lower than the median. Software margins are roughly 80%, while the professional services  team, which comprises about 14% of revenue operates at negative -17% gross margin. ServiceNow has mostly operated unprofitably, investing as much capital as it can into growth. But that’s not to say the business isn’t very capital efficient. The company raised less than $90 million before IPO. And in fact, ServiceNow has generated positive operating cash flow for every year but 2010. Although not that well known, ServiceNow is a business to be studied. The company has grown exceptionally quickly, using the median amount of capital, developed a superbly efficient sales and up selling playbook, all while being cash flow breakeven.

The role of the marketing team within SaaS has stretched from simply engendering awareness and creating interest, to guiding customers much deeper into the funnel. Steve Patrizi created the schematic above that illustrates the idea beautifully. In traditional go-to-market models, marketing teams fill the very top part of the funnel. When a potential customer enters the consideration phase of the buyer journey, the marketing team transitions the lead to his sales account executive, who educates the customer from the consideration stage through purchase. In the new model, marketing shepherds the customer from awareness through some portion of product evaluation. In freemium products, marketing cares for the customer through most of the product evaluation stage, at which point either customer success or sales closes the deal. In higher price point sales, sales picks up the customer after the customer indicates an intent to purchase. In either case, marketing ushers customers through substantially more of the funnel, than in the past. This change has three important ramifications for SaaS startups.  First, the scope of marketing activities has broadened significantly. The most sophisticated marketing plans today deploy at least nine disciplines which range from content marketing, to evangelist recruitment, to customer lifecycle marketing, to cohort conversion analysis. B2B marketing has become radically more complex. Consequently, marketing team sizes should grow as a fraction of total team size in newer model software companies Second, the marketing budget marketing will swell to match this expanding responsibility. In 2014, Gartner predicted Chief Marketing Officers would control more budget than Chief Information Officers by 2017 , and the initial data shows the trend to be accurate. This substantial shift of dollars has led to an explosion in the number of startups and product serving the CMO. The most recent landscape for marketing products totaled more than 2000 alternatives . I expect to see many more startups chasing CMO dollars. Third, the new expanse of marketing disciplines demands that the ideal head of marketing be informed and adept at each, able to recruit team members and evaluate performance.  Of course very few candidates will be able to claim mastery in each of the disciplines. So, it is incumbent for each startup to determine which of the disciplines is most important, given the goals and the stage of the business. The advantages of the high velocity software go to market are hard to overstate. These companies build more defensible, faster moving, and more capital efficient businesses. With those advantages, come the trade-off of additional complexity in the marketing department. But managed well, they can lead to exceptionally successful startups.

We may have been talking about SaaS companies for more than a decade, but we’re still just at the beginning. The legacy software companies including Oracle, Microsoft, SAP and and IBM control 83% of the market cap of software businesses, representing $830B in market cap. The largest SaaS company, Salesforce, is just about half the size of SAP, and Microsoft is 8x bigger. In revenue terms, the legacy vendors control an astounding 93% of revenue: $245B compared to $19B. While cloud software may not be able to wrest all the revenue from legacy players - there are after all some institutions where security remains paramount and cloud solutions just won’t fit the bill - SaaS startups have enormous opportunities before them. In addition, some of the revenue of SAP and Microsoft and Oracle is SaaS revenue, particularly as these business begin to acquire. SAP’s acquisition of Concur added $700M+ in annual SaaS revenue to their income statement. But by PWC’s estimates , SaaS represents less than 10% of the legacy players’ revenue. And keep in mind, these figures just account for replacement revenue and leave out all the new markets SaaS companies will create. The opportunities for SaaS companies is simply enormous.

I’m thrilled to welcome Mina Radhakrishnan as an entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) to Redpoint. Mina, my partner Jamie, and I got to know each other about 10 years ago at Google, where we were associate product managers all working in Marissa Mayer’s APM program. Since Google, Mina has done some amazing things. In particular, Mina was Uber’s first PM. She joined when the company numbered about 20 people, and stayed through until the employee base reached many thousands. Mina introduced surge pricing, built the on-boarding software for new drivers, and managed the releases of the key products of the company including UberX. Needless to say, Mina is an expert in product management for on-demand companies and market places. And of course, she has quite a few experiences managing the stress of hyper-growth. Mina joins Jeremy Gordon , former VPE of Twitter, Javier Soltero, founder and CEO of Acompli, Andy Rubin , creator of Android, Arthur van Hoff, co-author of Java and founder of Jaunt, among many EIRs who we’ve been lucky to work with.

In a recent podcast , Ron Gill, the CFO of Netsuite - a $7B+ market cap company with about $600M in 2014 revenue, which provides ERP software to mid-market companies -  articulated the importance of the Lifetime Value / Cost of Customer Acquisition (LTV/CAC) ratio for his company. LTV/CAC is often used to justify marketing and sales investment to acquire customers. But there’s much more to it. LTV/CAC is a powerful diagnostic tool for the performance of almost every team within the company: product, engineering, sales and marketing. Gross margin, which is an important factor in LTV, reflects the engineering architecture and the hosting costs required to support customers. Average revenue per customer is a function of the product and the sales efficiency (and arguably marketing/positioning.) The chart above isn’t meant to be comprehensive, but illustrate for a hypothetical company some of the constituent parts of the LTV/CAC. A real tree would be much more granular and could extend several layers deeper. In the past few years, Netsuite’s LTV/CAC ratio has more than doubled (an impressive feat given the stage of the business). In the 2009-2011 period, churn mitigation improved the LTV/CAC. At some point, the company couldn’t squeeze any more juice from that lemon. Companies churned from Netsuite because they went out of business or were acquired, not because they selected a competitor. More recently, as Netsuite has moved up market, and the larger average revenue per customer has improved the LTV/CAC. To identify the most important contributors impacting the LTV/CAC, Netsuite performs a regression on the underlying variables. Afterwards, the company calculates the ratio’s  sensitivity to each variable to understand the potential improvement attainable by focusing on reducing hosting costs for example. These analyses lead to a set of priorities for the business which will ultimately improve LTV/CAC. Tracking the metric over time provides SaaS companies with an indicator for the health of the business. But because the LTV/CAC ratio is a composite number which encapsulates many other key figures, it shouldn’t be used as the exclusive measure for the health of the business, but as an instrument to question the underlying dynamics, as those contributing factors can change the LTV/CAC ratio dramatically. Understanding the major drivers of this metric, the contributions of each team, and the sensitivity to investments in particular departments is a great way to prioritize internal growth and retention efforts for SaaS startups.

McKinsey developed the 9 Box Matrix in the 1970s to help GE prioritize investments across its 150 business units . Not all business units were equally attractive. Some should receive investments and others should be divested. The 9 Box Matrix evaluated business units on two dimensions: industry attractiveness and competitive strength of the business unit. At some point in the last 40 years, Human Resources teams co-opted this model as a talent management tool, and replaced the two industry axes with people specific ones: performance and potential, as depicted above.  Because the HR model has never been standardized, there are quite a few variations in circulation. But the usage patterns are consistent. The main goal of the 9 Box Matrix is to categorize employees, determine which to promote, retain and invest in, and which to reallocate. First, the company categorizes all their employees into these buckets. Often, it’s easiest for individual managers to do this individually, starting with the stars as benchmarks and move down and across the matrix to fill out the rest. Next, the management team meets to calibrate their categorizations. These calibrations ultimately inform compensation during annual performance reviews. Last, the management team implements a talent plan which invests in the four top right boxes and includes training, mentorship, assigning new projects and retention compensation. In addition, the plan should design a way to improve the performance of the low performing column either by managing that segment out of the company or reassignment to different roles. This matrix is often used as a tool to deliver performance evaluations, indicating to employees where they fit in the scheme of things, and what would be required of them to move about the matrix. The main challenge of the 9 Box Matrix presents to companies is assessing potential as objectively as possible. For example, potential varies by role. The potential of an employee within an individual contributor role could be quite different from that within a management role. Like most frameworks, the 9 Box Matrix is a simplifying tool for clarifying a process. If implemented well and customized to the needs of a startup, the 9 Box Matrix can be used to develop an effective talent management plan.

As the next generation of SaaS companies achieve maturity, they have begun to serve larger and larger customers, who in addition to demanding a great product, often request services. Professional services, as they are often called, entail training and customization. For product driven startups, the decision to offer professional services is a tricky one.

On one hand, the customer is always right and services often enable substantially larger contracts. On the other hand, selling hours to drive revenue decreases the efficiency of the business, by hiring more people in order to grow revenue linearly. In addition, many businesses operate their services divisions at a loss. But not all.

The chart above compares the gross margins on professional services across the 13 publicly traded SaaS with the largest average revenue per customer, which ranges from $50-$800K for the 2015 fiscal year where available, and otherwise the last disclosed year before acquisition. Some of these companies generate upwards of 30% of their revenue from professional services . So, the profitability of this unit  impacts the overall profitability of the business. While Jive and Hortonworks lose about forty cents per dollar of professional services, the negative gross margin contingent constitutes the minority in this data set. There is an outlier: MobileIron generates 61% gross margin on services, which is close to their software margin (81%), and closer still to the median across public traded software companies of 70%. This is because MobileIron offers both licenses and software subscriptions. The annual support contracts for the licenses bump up the gross margin quite a bit. So it’s not quite apples to apples. The remaining gross margin positive companies tend to operate their professional services teams at somewhere between 15 to 25 points of margin. The greater the fraction revenue from professional services, the larger the gross margins tend to be. Again, this is likely because of the substantial influence over the overall economics of the business. If the professional services team represents 30% of revenue and is operating at a negative margin, then the overall margins of the business suffer greatly.
Hortonworks, in the bottom right, is an outlier – though, I suspect this is a deliberate strategy to win share in a competitive market with a commodity open source product. Typically, larger average revenue per customer contracts enable better margins. This is logical. If a customer spends $500,000 per year on software, the marginal cost of $150k in services in order to make sure the deployment succeeds seems like a relatively cheap insurance policy, even at high margin. After all, there is an internal champion who pushed the purchasing decision through procurement, and is, for all intents and purposes, pot committed to ensuring success.
On the other hand, the stakes aren’t so large for a $20,000 per year product. Consequently the willingness to pay for professional services diminishes as a function of price point.  Again, MobileIron  is an outlier because of its license software business. The decision to offer professional services shouldn’t be taken lightly. It requires staffing a new team, crafting an offering to customers, and modeling the financial impact to the business. The data suggests that customers are willing to pay 20%+ margins on price points of greater than $200,000. Less than that price point, the data shows it to be difficult to operate a professional services team at better than breakeven.

Of the 43 SaaS companies to have gone public in the time period between 2006 and 2014, 60% are trading above their IPO pop price – the price at the end of their first day of trading. The median company has appreciated 69% since its IPO. The chart above shows the trends for each of the companies in this data set.
Xero tops the list that more than 17x appreciation. This is an anomaly; the company went public right as it was founded and has grown to be worth several billion dollars. It’s an amazing story .  On the bottom end, Castlight has dropped by 80 percentage points in value since its IPO, to a market cap of about $850 million, and trades below the typical SaaS company at about 7x forward revenues. If you’re curious about the trends from IPO offer, you can find the chart here. In contrast to the balanced historical stock performance, when all of these companies went out for the IPO, there was broad excitement about them. The chart above shows the IPO pop, the change in share price from offering to first day trading close. Almost every stock, all except three, saw some appreciation. The average company’s market capitalization grew by 32%.
The data indicates, that despite relatively broad excitement for SaaS companies at IPO, eventually, the market discerns the differences in the revenue models, go to markets, and attractiveness of different businesses. Looking at the IPO cohorts, we can see that the vast majority of companies have appreciated from their offer price. [Here is a zoomed in version]
(price_appreciation_since_offer_zoom.png) Even recent IPOs, some of which have faced skepticism, trade above offer.

The data also shows that over time, companies appreciate more as their revenues grow. This is a very natural trend. But these companies have also had to fight multiple compression in the market. In 2014, revenue multiples fell by 30% , meaning any share price appreciation had to overcome this decline. Overall, the data tells a heartening story. There is quite a bit of excitement for new software companies in the public markets. But that enthusiasm isn’t blind. Public market investors are able to distinguish exceptional businesses from not so exceptional businesses. This judgment is healthy. It indicates the market that isn’t blindly investing in B2B technology companies. Rather, public market investors are pricing each based on the characteristics of the business’s prospects.

In 2000, the majority of tech acquisitions were primarily stock. One company would buy another using its own shares, instead of paying for the target business in cash. But since then, there’s been a secular trend to cash deals. In 2014, 90% of the tech M&A transactions consummated by companies, and excluding private equity firms, in the US with disclosed deal values were cash deals. As the cash balances of large tech incumbents balloons (Apple is at greater than $30B, Google at more than $65B, Microsoft has $95B, etc), more and more M&A is primarily cash, because cash is cheap and interest rates are low. The best return on capital then is acquisition or stock buy backs which hit a record high earlier this year . In gross terms, the same story holds true. In 2014, companies spent $22.4B of cash to acquire, compared to $864M in stock. Interestingly, the median value of a cash transaction is 3x the size of a stock transaction, at $150M compared to $50M. Typically, cash transactions are better for founders. There’s no risk of the transaction value depreciating with the fluctuations of the stock market. And the data shows the prices are typically much higher, although that’s probably more correlation than causation - more attractive companies demand better terms including higher prices and cash transactions. Because the cash balances of large tech incumbents continues to rise, and because of the low interest rate environment, we should continue to expect M&A to be completed primarily in cash.

Creating a sense of urgency is one of the most powerful sales tools available to SaaS companies. There are many different ways of accomplishing this, but one of the most common ways is to offer discounts that expire. Discounts are powerful incentives to increase sales. But, they have to be crafted correctly, or they can have dramatic impact on a startup’s cash position. This is why sales incentives should be designed hand-in-hand with the company’s finance team.
Imagine a hypothetical 20 person software company. Suppose this month is seasonally slow month, and the executive team decides to implement a 25% discount to accelerate sales. There are many ways of offering this discount to customers. Above, I have modeled three: a 25% reduction billed monthly, a 25% reduction billed upfront, and the first three months of the subscription are free. Each of these options costs customers the same total amount over the course of 12 months. But, the cash position of the business is quite different for each because there is a difference in the timing of when commissions are paid (cash out) and when customers pay (cash in), which can cause a cash squeeze. A few more relevant details behind a model. The company has five salespeople, and five sales development reps. The account executives have a quota of $720,000 per year, and the company charges its customers $25,000 per year. the account executives make $120k in on target earnings, split 50/50 between salary and commission. And the sales development reps earn $50k annually. I’m not including benefits in these calculations.
In the case of the 25% off billed monthly, the company pays salary and commission in month one to the sales team of about $71k. Over the next 12 months, the customer pays a discounted monthly fee the company suffers a unit cash shortage through month five. In the case of the three free months then annual prepay, the company suffers a cash shortage through the first quarter of the contract and then receives a lump sum payment of $180,000 a month 4. In the last case, of a 25% discount with annual prepay, the company never suffers a cash shortfall.
This is a really simple model intended to show the importance of understanding the timing of cash inflows from customers and cash outflows from sales commissions. In steady-state, most businesses maintain a stable balance between these two. But, when designing sales incentives in order to spur a slow month, it can be easy to forget the cash impact to the business of a particular promotion.

Traditional software was initially sold by perpetual license. Then in the mid-00s with the advent of SaaS, the market shifted to per seat per year pricing. And simultaneously, freemium marketing strategies blossomed. Freemium companies provide software for free temporarily to entice users to try and use the product. Eventually, these users cross a threshold and convert to a paid subscriber. This threshold can be based on number of people using the product (Expensify), number of documents signed in a month (HelloSign), or additional product features needed by users (Yammer). Today, we’re seeing a new segment of the SaaS ecosystem move to free - the SaaS Enabled Marketplace (SEM). SaaS Enabled Marketplaces, like Contently, charge for both software (content management tools) and access to a market place (of content producers). Chris Dixon has a catch phrase for this type of business: come for the tool, stay for the network . The free SaaS enabled market places (FSEM), of which Zenefits is the most prominent, also build software and provide access to a market place. However, unlike traditional SEMs companies, FSEMs never charge for their software, preferring to generate revenue from transactional or lead generation fees from their market place. Zenefits provides free benefits software to businesses and generates revenue from commissions when employers or employees buy insurance plans through the platform. This go-to-market strategy benefits FSEMs in three important ways. First, good free software spreads quickly, enabling rapid customer acquisition. In competitive markets or when pursuing customers that have been expensive to acquire, free software creates a clear, and often defensible, competitive distribution advantage. Incumbents often can’t compete with free without cannibalizing their current business. Second, this free software builds an important data asset. FSEMs software captures information about the user and often, other key data like company size, activity and growth rates, which can be used to inform a market place. After all, on the other side of the market place, suppliers want to pursue particular types of customers. The data from the free app can also be used to prioritize the leads for the FSEM’s inside sales teams, among other things. Third, the software usage can be used to bootstrap a market place and develop liquidity. Once a market place has developed liquidity, it’s very difficult to unseat. Most market places have winner take all dynamics, meaning the business’ position is all but unassailable. But, FSEMs implicitly trade great distribution and data assets for an arguably less attractive revenue model which has smaller gross margins and often less predictability. Unlike traditional SaaS companies which charge subscription fees for software and operate between 70-80% gross margins, FSEMs’ primary revenue streams often are lead generation fees for providing business to the other side of a market place. These fees can range widely but often generate around 30% gross margins. Additionally, transactional revenue isn’t as predictable as subscription, which for SaaS companies with 12 month annual subscriptions is contractually guaranteed. FSEMs can be incredibly disruptive businesses. They can grow exceptionally quickly, erect substantial defensive moats and jumpstart marketplaces. While we won’t see FSEMs in every category of SaaS, because only a small subsegment of software categories can benefit from a market place, where they do take hold, FSEMs will be powerful forces to be reckoned with.

Orbiting the Giant Hairball is one of the most unusual business books I’ve read. It’s irreverent, full of drawings, and completely chaotic in the most wonderful way. Gordon MacKenzie, the author of the book, worked at Hallmark cards for 30 years to the day. He started initially in the creative department imagining greeting cards and ultimately found himself with the title Creative Paradox. In his book, he described the way he injected creativity into his working life. I thought it was a great book with three salient themes. The book’s unforgettable title may be the only one in the business section of the bookstore with the word hairball. Gordon contends that all companies are hairballs. Each person, each problem, each process adds to the hairball and creates a gravity, a permanence, in the way that the company operates. Because it’s such an intertwined thing, the hairball impossible to unwind. So, in order to succeed in companies, he argues we need to operate outside of this hairball. If we orbit the hairball, observe how it works, but live in our own world then we can be happy and successful. Orbiting means redefining the scope of our jobs and the ways that we accomplish our goals. Hence the title. Creativity is another important topic Gordon explores. Responsible for creating seminars, workshops and generally getting people inside Hallmark to expand their mindsets, Gordon is a believer in nonlinear thinking. There is an important tension inside of businesses, and particularly startups. At the beginning of the company, the founders are trying to create something out of chaos, and transform non-scalable actions into highly scalable processes. This is an evolution from nonlinear to linear thinking. But, it’s important for companies to revert back to nonlinear thinking often; that’s how creativity is born. In a chapter called First There’s Grope, Then There’s Rote, Gordon describes the way he developed a creativity workshop for the Hallmark management team of the company. Gordon held a three hour session - a chaotic, creative, tactile environment, called “Grope,” that challenged people’s notions of work. The first workshop was a huge success. To prepare for the second workshop, Gordon used his notes from the first. But the second one failed, because it had become a product of the process. it was the same as the first In his words, it had become rote, linear, uncreative. So he reverted to chaos and the success continued. Last, Gordon recounts a story about the cultural toxicity of teasing and criticism. When hosting a workshop for team of salespeople, he asks everyone in the room to use some crayons and a piece of paper to draw some representation of what they do at work. When a woman in the back of the room decides to share, she comes to the front of the room and begins to draw. Immediately, members of the audience critique her drawing skills. Gordon contends this kind of criticism is a mechanism to force people to revert to the norm, to be like anybody else, and is poisonous to creativity. What’s wonderful about this book is that it characterizes the point of view of a cultural iconoclast within a large company. These perspectives stretch the reader’s mind about what culture ought to be, and how to break out of the every day in order to engender creativity. It’s not to say that process and prioritization aren’t important - they are critical - but rather, they must be balanced. There are no frameworks, no best practices, just a collection of stories and drawings that articulate thought-provoking points of view. It’s a wonderful book to help founders and “number worshipers” like me rebalance our world-views.

In the late 1990s, two of the dominant talent management platforms were founded. Taleo and SuccessFactors grew very quickly after they entered the market, bringing novel delivery to the human capital market. Both companies eventually offered talent acquisition, performance management, and learning tools for human resources teams. But they started in different places. Taleo initially focused on recruiting tools and SuccessFactors on performance management. As the chart above shows, both companies scaled revenue rapidly, reaching $100M in revenue 7 years after founding. SuccessFactors started out a bit slower, but eventually grew about twice as fast as Taleo. Both companies were acquired around the same time. SAP purchased SuccessFactors for $3.4B in December 2011, and Oracle bought Taleo for $1.9B in February 2012. Company Revenue at IPO, $M Customers at IPO ACV at IPO, $k Year of IPO Years Since Founding SuccessFactors 39 1300 30 2007 6 Taleo 85 1000 85 2005 6 The companies pursued slight different strategies in the market. SuccessFactor’s average customer value (ACV) was less than half of Taleo’s according to each company’s S-1 document, the filings related to an IPO. Interestingly, despite the smaller contract sizes, SuccessFactors invested substantially more in sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue to generate their top-line growth than Taleo. In fact, SuccessFactors spent twice as much for at least three years. Both companies demonstrated very volatile sales efficiencies, which are probably more influenced by the macro economic environment than the performance of the sales teams. Both of these business weathered the dot com crash in 2001 and the financial meltdown in 2008. SuccessFactors also generated slightly lower gross margins compared with Taleo. SuccessFactors generated a greater fraction of revenues from professional services throughout its life, about 30-35% compared to Taleo, which hovered around 20-25%. Professional services depress gross margins because they are often sold at cost or at negative gross margin. As a consequence of the substantial investment in sales and marketing, SuccessFactors reached cash flow breakeven seven years after founding. Meanwhile, Taleo broke through in year 3. The same story plays out with profitability. Taleo hovered around the profitability mark as soon as year 4, compared to year 8 for SuccessFactors. Both Taleo and SuccessFactors spent roughly equal amounts as a percent of revenue on engineering. At the time of their acquisitions, SuccessFactors was growing more quickly than Taleo, likely contributing to the 2x premium the company commanded in the M&A market. Additionally, the business’ offering was widely perceived as being broader and more defensible.

At Gainsight’s Pulse Conference on Customer Success, Mike McKee of Rapid7 spoke about the structure of his customer success team. He projected a slide, which I’ve copied in the image above, that depicts the way Rapid7 sells a contract, deploys its software, engenders adoption and expands accounts. It’s the best visualization  I’ve seen to describe the sales and customer success process and the inter-team collaboration required to be successful. The four parts of his customer success team are: Sales Engineers/PreSales participate in the sales process with account executives to close the sale. Professional Services provides customers software customization and training. Customer Success Managers nurtures and expands the accounts. The Learning Team provides customers ongoing help with best practices, knowledge bases, webinars to maximize product use and drive retention. Here’s how the process works. In the sales step, an account executive (with a sales development rep/SDR) qualifies a prospect. At or close to the time of sale, the account executive partners with member of the sales engineering team and/or the services team to set the right expectations and scope any custom work or training to be done. The sales engineers (also called presales) report to the head of customer success to ensure the company can satisfy the customer’s needs, set the customer up for success and mitigate potential churn from overpromising. In the deployment phase, the account executive passes the role of customer relationship lead to a member of the customer success organization. The customer success manager works with sales engineering and services to ensure that all the promised work has been completed successfully. In addition, the learning team provides knowledge to the customer and the rest of the in-house team. This learning should encourage the customer to use more and more of the feature set, or spread the product internally, which leads ultimately to account expansion. At this point, the customer success manager (CSM) passes the relationship lead back to an account executive, which can be the same as in the Sales process. In other cases, startups employ dedicated upsell sales teams. In yet other cases , startups ask their customer success managers to upsell and add a quota to their CSM’s compensation structure. In this chart above, the people in the customer success organization are in blue. Only account executives report to the VP of Sales. Everyone else reports to the SVP of CS. While many SaaS startups employ this type of organizational structure, there are a few variations on this model that work very well. When structuring a customer success organization with however many teams and team members, there are two critical things to consider. First, aligning goals properly (ex. presales reporting to the head of CS), and second, building and refining the processes to create seamless handoffs to and from relationship leads at each sale of the process.

Ariba went public in 1999 three years after having been founded. In its first year of selling, the company generated $800,000 in revenue. Then it ramped. $8 million, then $45 million, then $274M. In a three-year period, the company had grown 33x  and achieved an astounding CAGR of 224% over the same period. Ariba shares increased 300% on its first day of trading at IPO, valuing the company at $6 billion.  At its peak, the company would be worth $40 billion, but after the dotcom crash, the share price returned from the stratosphere to normal levels. Ultimately, SAP acquired the company in 2012 for $4.6B. Before its acquisition, which was consummated at the highest historical multiple of any software company , Ariba was the largest independent procurement software business. It sold software to help  businesses buy the things they need in order to operate, everything from pens to planes.  In particular, Ariba sold software to run RFPs, manage contracts with suppliers, analyze corporate spending and ensure financial compliance.  Another unique characteristic about the story of Ariba:  the founding team was seven people. At the outset, Ariba sustained very high gross margins, in the low 80 percent range. Over time, as the company began to serve larger customers and began offering customization of their procurement software, the gross margins dipped reaching its nadir in 2006, at 46%. At this point in time, Ariba generated 56% of its revenue from professional services, which dramatically depressed because margins. Over time, the company would reduce professional services to about 33%. Ariba’s growth was remarkably efficient. The company spent $46.4M in sales and marketing efforts in the years before generating more than $200 million in revenue. At the time of its IPO, the company was only investing about 75% of its revenue and sales and marketing. After the company successfully completed its IPO, the company would increase its annual sales and marketing budget by 6X year-over-year to $230M and $298M in 2000 and 2001, at precisely the wrong time. The market would correct shortly thereafter. Ariba enjoyed terrific sales efficiency through its first three years. The company started to rapidly increase marketing expense in 2001, and the market fell out from underneath them, the sales efficiency dropped dramatically,  and the company actually recorded a negative sales efficiency. In 2002,  the company invested significantly in sales and marketing, but suffered a decline in revenue. Presumably this is due to customer churn, as a fair number of their customers must have gone out of business. Additionally, Ariba spent relatively modest fraction of their revenue on engineering efforts. In a typical year, the company invested about 20 to 30% of their revenue in research and development. Of course, given the large size of professional services contracts, a fair amount of custom software development was  completed at the behest of customers. Ariba attained profitability in 2009 for the first time. But, the company has been operating at close to breakeven since 2004. The notable dip in 2001, when Ariba notched a loss of $2.7B, or -674% net income as a percentage of revenue figure. Ariba acquired a company called Tradex technologies for $1.6B in 1999, and ultimately wrote off about $1.4B, which had to be recognized in the period from 2000 to 2002. Similar to net income, Ariba sustained cash flow breakeven for the first time in 2009, but flirted with the mark since about 2004. In the end, Ariba’s team built a rocketship that grew  incredibly quickly, weathered quite a bit of market turbulence, and ultimately created a lasting business that still defines the procurement industry today.

The rate at which startups are raising follow-on rounds is decreasing, and has decreased steadily from 2003 through 2013.  Between 2003 and 2006, post-Series A  startups raised series Bs about 57% of the time. However from 2011-2014, that figure fell to 28%.  The same trend is true in series C rounds, where success rates fell from 43% to 35%. ![image]( https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/rounds_by_type051115.png " width=100%/> This decline in startup follow-on fundraising success is the result of an increased number of series A, which have been growing at a rate of 18% per year since 2009. Meanwhile, series Bs and series Cs were steady over the same period. As the number of series As has increased, the sizes of the As have remained constant. In 2014, the median series A was $5.5M, the roughly the same as the average over the past decade. 2015 seems to buck the trend with a median of $8M, but the year is still young, so it’s too early to tell. Meanwhile, series B and C each have doubled since 2009. More and more early-stage companies are raising the $5.5M standard series A.  A “fixed” number of startups each year are able to raise follow-on rounds, and when they do, those rounds are twice as big as they were five years ago. This contrasting growth of the series A market and stability in the series B and C market depresses follow-on success rates. Lastly, the decline in follow-on rates does not seem to be tied to longer period between rounds. In other words,  irrespective of the size of a startup’s financing round, whether in the series A or series B, follow-on rounds are typically raised 500 days after  the previous one closes. And this is true for every quartile of company. Meaning, even the fastest rounds today are happening just as fast as they were 10 years ago.  The chart above shows the data for follow on rates from series A to series B. Ultimately, this data implies that there is plenty of Series A capital available for startups. And other analysis shows that there is plenty of capital for later stage rounds for startups . However, the fundraising market has a barbell profile, where the amount of capital allocated to series B and series C is relatively fixed. With a greater number of series A companies competing for a finite amount dollars, there is greater competition and consequently, the follow-on success rate has dropped by about half. Notes about the analysis: I used capital IQ data for this analysis. I screened for US venture backed IT and online retailing companies. For most of these analyses, I only look at companies that had raised follow ons. In the “Follow On Success Rate Chart,” the x-axis is the year of the either the series A in the case of series A-to-B conversion, or the Series B in the case of the series B-to-C conversion.

Mobile visits account for more than 50% of all e-commerce . During the holiday season in 2014, that figure exceeded 70% for Walmart . In India, mobile usage dominates traffic to such an extent that Myntra, the largest retailer, is shutting down their web application to focus exclusively on their mobile apps . Instagram launched a website only after the mobile app reached more than 100M users . If the consumer world is any indication of the future, we should expect to see a massively successful mobile-only SaaS company in the next few years. User preferences for simpler app UIs, the advantages of mobile app distribution through app stores and the consumerization of IT (the notion that end users now make IT purchasing decisions rather than the CIO) are three key forces creating this opportunity for startups. In addition, there’s a fourth wave: according to Intuit research, 40% of Americans will be freelancers in five years , fueled by companies like Uber, PostMates, HomeJoy and others. This simply compounds the opportunity for mobile software. Not every category of software has the potential to become mobile only. Many workers prefer to use laptops at work for bigger screens. For example, a CFO’s accounting application or an engineer’s development environment are unlikely to transform exclusively into mobile apps. In addition, many SaaS products have a 2 step value proposition , selling first to an end user and then to an ultimate purchaser and decision-maker. However, there are huge swaths of the working population that don’t work in desk jobs, and who rely on their mobile phones and tablets as their primary computer. Field sales people, hair-stylists, plumbers and construction teams are some examples. Anyone who is trying to organize and run their business always on the go, and who an individual business owner or operator of a small business, is the perfect target market for the first mobile-only software company. The consumer world is rapidly migrating to mobile as the predominant computing platform, and in some cases, the exclusive platform. At some point in the very near future, software products will move in the same direction.

In the late 90s, one company changed its name five times before they settled on one which today is a well-known brand. The business started as Silver Computing in 1995, then Stellar Computing in June 1997. Six months later, the company would rebrand as next ActiveTouch Systems, then six months later to ActiveTouch Inc., and finally, six months before IPO to WebEx. WebEx went public in June 2000 with $8.3M in revenue over the previous twelve months. After three relatively slow years, growing from $1M to $3M, the company’s revenue rocketed 7x, then 3x and the close to 2x, as the chart above shows.  And churn was pretty impressive, too. WebEx retained 95% of their customers the year they went public. To achieve that phenomenal growth in 2000, the company ramped their sales and marketing investment from $2M to $9.3M to $50M from 1998 to 2000, representing an astounding 300%+ of revenue. After the dot-com crash, the company stabilized their investment in sales and marketing constant at $50M, which was roughly 40% of revenues. The executive team sustained that level for eight years, until their acquisition by Cisco for $3.2B. WebEx benefitted from an extremely efficient sales model. Setting aside 1999, the company enjoyed sales efficiency of greater than 1 until the business attained $150M+ in revenue. As we’ve seen in the other S-1 analyses , most companies never observe sales efficiencies better than about 1.1, for the two years before IPO and subsequently, which makes WebEx’s model that much more impressive at scale. The combination of the company’s revenue retention and sales efficicency suggest the massive investments in sales and marketing were substantiated by strong unit economics. This dramatic sales and marketing investment generated an $80M loss in 2000, but two years later, astoundingly, the company generated $16.4M in profit, or about 12% of revenues. This ability to transform from burning huge amounts of cash, to attaining both cash flow break-even and profitability, all the while growing more than 30% per year is due in large part to the unit economics of the business. From then on the company remained profitable. At the company’s spending peak, the company burned $3.75M per month. In total, the company consumed about $65M to reach cash flow break-even and profitability, having raised about $110M before a $40M IPO. WebEx’s story is an important one particularly today, given the state of the fundraising markets for startups. Despite the collapse of the stock market the disappearance of many startups/customers, and the tremendous burn rate of the business, WebEx grew steadily and consistently. The history of WebEx exemplifies the importance of operating a business with sound principles and decision-making .  Great customer retention and superb sales efficiency are a winning combination. If a business has great economics, no matter the disasters and turmoil in the external environment, the company can be worth billions and grow throughout a down-cycle.

My first major negotiation was a potential advertising agreement between Google and Facebook. I was PM on the social advertising team at the time. There was a call scheduled at 2pm one afternoon, and I had been told that morning about it. I’m wasn’t an experienced negotiator, so I panicked. I didn’t know how these conversations worked. I called some a few other product managers I knew inside Google, and asked  their advice. I downloaded a few eBooks on negotiation and took notes. When 2pm came, I dialed into the call. I’m sure the Facebook team could hear my ragged nerves over the phone. I realized a few minutes into the conversation that these 60 minutes were the first step of many. We chatted on the phone, became acquainted and sketched the outlines of a partnership that might make sense. Ultimately, and for many different reasons, Facebook chose Microsoft as their advertising partner . Since that frenetic morning almost a decade ago, I’ve been trying to learn as much as I can about negotiation. There are a multitude of approaches: the theoretical zone of possible alternatives and best alternative to negotiated agreement ; hard counter offers & brinksmanship; maximizing leverage; wearing people down; never conceding, always trading. Each of these frameworks provides a negotiator a way of ensuring they win the points that are important to their startup, trading less important elements away,  and to ensure the partnership is mutually beneficial. After I understood the tenets of these frameworks, the most difficult part for me to understand became the mentality of the best negotiators. Take for example, this self-diagnostic question from Everything is Negotiable : True or False: Faced with a difficult opponent in a negotiation, it is better to concede something of little value in order to create  goodwill. This question gets to the heart of the negotiator’s state of mind. Most people say true (I did). But that’s not the right answer. In fact, the question is structured to create a defensive posture in the reader. Look at the diction: stronger opponent (there are no opponents in negotiation); concede (never concede only trade); etc. Because negotiation happens between two people, the personalities of the individuals and the chemistry between them will define the way the negotiations unfold. Frameworks for thinking through negotiation are helpful. But ultimately, practice  forges the best negotiators. I’ve been told that the very best corporate M&A teams repeatedly practice their negotiation sessions among themselves, playing both sides of the table, before the real thing. Founders negotiate every day. Financings, job offers, real estate leases, software contracts, promotions. Everything is a negotiation. Improving negotiation skills is a powerful way to improve a startup’s efficiency and ability to accomplish key goals on the right terms for the business. Make sure you invest the time to outline your goals, research the frameworks for negotiation and take the time to practice before a big meeting.

An entrepreneur last week asked me if bottoms up businesses are more efficient software companies than top down sales processes. Enabled by web and mobile app distribution, the bottoms up software business acquires individual users, small teams and eventually departments. The top down model sells to a C-level executive (CEO, CIO, CFO) and captures the relevant part of the organization through one sales process. Because the bottoms up processes tend to rely on seemingly less expensive customer acquisition techniques like content marketing and in-product up-sell initially, this founder suggested, quite reasonably I thought, that bottoms up companies are more efficient. In this post, we’ll compare the efficiencies of bottoms up and top down companies across four dimensions: revenue growth, gross margin, profitability, and capital raised. I curated a bucket of companies for each category. Zendesk, Hubspot, New Relic and Tableau represent the Bottoms Up bucket. Workday, Responsys, Demandware, Taleo and ServiceNow in the Top Down bucket. The revenue chart above shows the individual revenue growth trajectories of the companies in each basket, demarcated by color: red for Bottoms Up and blue for Top Down. Top Down companies ServiceNow and Workday have tracked the two fastest and highest magnitude growth curves.  Zendesk is tracing ServiceNow’s revenue trajectory. Using statistical analysis, however, we can’t prove a difference between the revenue growth patterns of Bottoms Up and Top Down companies. Let’s examine the gross profit of each type of business. Top Down companies should offer more professional services, which should depress gross margins compared to Bottoms Up companies. The chart above shows the average value for each type of company as a line, and the area depicts the value of one standard deviation out from the mean. The Bottoms Up companies do seem to exhibit a 15 percentage point advantage in gross margin, which is consistent with the theory that professional services depress Top Down approaches. The variance of the Bottoms Up gross margin is substantially greater than the Top Down companies which have far greater consistency in their gross margin profiles. However, again, the data isn’t strong enough yet to be statistically significant. Net Income/Profitability seems to be roughly equal for the two types of companies. Both types of companies seem cross the profitability threshold around year 10. Bottoms Up companies exhibit greater losses in year 6, and generally speaking see a greater variance in profitability. Last, the box plot above shows the distribution of capital raised by company type. Surprisingly, Bottoms Up companies tend to raise more. The dollars raised analysis is challenged by a few different factors. First, not all these companies raised money because they needed it, so venture capital raised isn’t a pure proxy for cash burn. Second, the cyclicality of the venture market has a greater impact on total dollars raised. For example, New Relic’s first two rounds were $3.4M and $8.9M, both of which occurred in 2008, would likely have been substantially larger today. Here are the individual data points: Bottoms Up Top Down Company $M Raised Company $M Raised New Relic 216 Workday 189 HubSpot 101 ServiceNow 84 Zendesk 71 Responsys 63 Tableau 15 DemandWare 53 Taleo 26 Ultimately, the data shows great businesses can be built using both sales methodologies. We can’t prove with this data set that there are meaningful differences in any of four measures of startup efficiency including revenue growth, gross margin, profitability or cash raised. Perhaps that will change as the many private software companies go public and we can analyze more data from the relatively newer Bottoms Up approach. But for now, we can say both approaches produce equally efficient companies.

Rumors swirled yesterday that Salesforce, the $40B SaaS behemoth, had been approached by an acquirer. Dan Primack speculated this morning that Oracle and Microsoft are the likely candidates . If Salesforce were to be acquired, the SaaS ecosystem would change substantially. Looking at the market caps and the balance sheets of the major enterprise acquirers, Microsoft could certainly acquire Salesforce outright in cash. Oracle would likely acquire the business in a cash & stock transaction. Company Market Cap, $B (2015-04-29) Cash & Eq., $B Microsoft 398 95 Oracle 211 44 IBM 172 9 Intel 156 15 SAP 91 5 Salesforce 49 1 VMWare 38 7 Most importantly, the number of large market cap companies capable of acquiring substantial SaaS startups would decline. In the past ten years, Salesforce has been the second most active acquirer of next-generation enterprise companies at greater than $100M, tied with IBM and second to Oracle. Salesforce acquires more frequently than most others, but their median purchase is smaller, about $400M compared to roughly $1B for the others. SAP is an outlier because of their Concur, SuccessFactors and Sybase acquisitions. In terms of total transaction value, Salesforce has spent $4.2B in the past five years in acquisitions greater than $100M, tied with Dell and VMWare. Microsoft didn’t make the list because they’ve spent about $1.5B in the last five years on Yammer, Acompli and Sunrise. Salesforce is squarely in the middle of the pack when it comes to very large acquisitions, in this case ExactTarget at $2.6B. If Salesforce were to sell, the M&A landscape in the startup ecosystem would lose an active acquirer.

When I first started writing, I wondered how I could make charts like those in the Economist or in the New York Times, the beautifully formatted ones. After some research, I figured out how. And this post explains how you can do it, too. Many data scientists use a free open-source language called R. It’s a great tool for processing data and I use R to process all the data for this blog. You can download it here . Alternatively, many people use RStudio , an editor which makes R much easier to use. To make these charts, I use a library written by Hadley Wickham called ggplot2 .  ggplot2 has all kinds of charts: area, line, bar, etc. You can see all of them here That all sounds much more complicated than it is. To make the chart above which is a point chart of random data, just download RStudio, create a new file and paste the code below into it. Then hit the run button and you should have it. My code borrows heavily from Max Woolf’s tutorial for the theme function. I used to do it all in line, but collecting all the formatting details in a function is an elegant way of formatting the plot. Max’s post is well worth reading to understand some of the more complex features of ggplot. #install and load charting library
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

#create a data set with random data
data = data.frame("x" = runif(10, 3,10), "y"=runif(10,50,250))

The first SaaS startup started as a packaged software company. After selling floppy disks and CD-ROMs of expense software in computer software stores, the company changed models for the first time, and sold software licenses directly to enterprises. The company went public on this model in 1998. But soon after the crash of 2001, the startup’s market cap totaled only $8M. So the business evolved again and became a pure SaaS business, selling software accessible to anyone with a browser. Thirteen years later, the company generated more than $600M in annual revenue in 2014 and sold to SAP for $8.3B in the largest ever SaaS acquisition , and it is one of the very few SaaS companies ever to achieve both positive revenue and cash flow break-even . That company is Concur, the travel and expense business. SaaS history isn’t very long. But Concur’s story stands out as a seminal journey for a few reasons. First, the company’s founders persisted and persisted, and ultimately built a category defining company. Second, Concur’s history provides a mechanism to contrast the license software and a SaaS business models. The chart above plots Concur’s revenues through its three eras, starting in 1995 through 2014. Each era (CD, License, Cloud) is shaded. The company generated about $2M in revenue as it switched to its licensed software business. Then Concur quickly grew to about $41M over the next five years, before the transition to selling SaaS in 2001. Concur completed the full transition to cloud by 2005. Then the company’s revenue skyrocketed to more than $700M in 2014. Concur’s gross margins were highest late in its Cloud era. In the CD days, the costs of writing the software on disk, packaging, shipping, stocking the boxes, and the commission paid to the retail store depressed gross margins to below 40%. The license model increased gross margins to better than 60%. Professional services (training and customization) represented the majority of cost of goods sold (COGS) for the business during the License Era. In the Cloud Era, the economies of scale powered the company to achieve all time gross margin highs in 2010 of about 72%. Let’s shift to profitability (net income). Concur’s transition to SaaS transformed the business from one with a less than -100% net income as percent of revenue, to a net income positive business. At roughly the same time, the business became cash flow break-even (CFBE). Achieving both CFBE and positive net income is no mean feat , and it’s a testament to the strength of the company’s business model and the discipline of the management team. I spoke to Steve Singh, the founder and CEO of Concur, about the company’s history, and he told me, “We decided it was not good enough to to be cash flow positive. We also wanted to be profitable. It forces a great discipline on the business…Operating at a profit brings to light all the things that we are not great at.  If we can focus on our weaknesses alongside the things we are great at, we will become impossible to beat.” Very few companies survive one major business model evolution. Concur is exceptional for thriving after two of them,   recording exceptional financial performance, and for being a founder-led business from the beginning.

The Information reported last week that in 2014, only 11% of tech IPOs in 2014 were profitable when they became publicly traded companies, an all time low stretching back to 1980, when the figure was 88%. This raises the seemingly absurd question, how important is it to be profitable for a startup? After all, growth is the largest determinant of valuation at IPO , not profitability. Only 19 of the 48 publicly traded SaaS companies in the basket I track have ever recorded a financial year with a positive net income. As the chart above shows, the  median publicly traded SaaS company, marked in red, never achieves positive net income. There are a handful of outliers who have sustained positive net income for a while, but they are very few. Only 3 companies of the 48 have more positive net income years than negative net income years. However, cash flow is a different story. All 48 companies have recorded a year with positive cash flow from operations, and the median company reaches cash flow positive six years after founding, and sustains the trend. Some like LinkedIn do this in spectacular fashion, charting more than $569M in 2014 cash from operations. Which is a better metric of the health of a SaaS company, though, net income or cash flow from operations? For a quick primer on these metrics, see this short post the differences between Bookings, MRR, Revenue and Cash . Cash flow from operations measures the changes in the company’s bank accounts. Accounts grow when customers pay to use software, and accounts shrink as the company pays its employees, rent and other expenses. Cash flow break even means the company’s coffers are growing. The data above implies most SaaS companies grow their cash reserves each year. This is possible because of the frequent SaaS practice of asking for up-front payments from customers . On the other hand, positive net income means the company’s recognized revenue exceeds the costs of the business that year. It’s a much higher bar. Let’s paint the difference with an example. A SaaS company books a 3 year $3M deal. On the first day of the contract, the company’s cash balance increases by $3M, and the company can spend $2.9M for the rest of the year and still record a positive cash flow year. But the company can only recognize $1M each year in revenue, per the terms of accrual accounting, so to be net income positive, the company can only spend $1M on its R&D, Sales and Marketing, real estate, and all other costs. Most public SaaS companies prefer to invest their cash into faster growth at the expense of their net income. The argument of the day defending this tactic is that if the company wanted to achieve net income profitability, the business would simply stop spending as much to grow, and wait for the subscription payments to come in, yielding great profitability. We can argue both sides. But at this point, the market is rewarding SaaS businesses for growth, irrespective of net income. Should there come a time when the public markets demand both cash flow break even and net income positive businesses, then the consequence will be substantially smaller growth rates for many of these businesses because they will be far more constrained by the amount of capital they can invest in growth.

Yesterday, I met with a bright, young SaaS entrepreneur who asked me to clarify four key numbers for SaaS companies: bookings, monthly recurring revenue, recognized revenue and cash collections. These four numbers are critical to understanding the health of a SaaS startup, and they can be quite different, so it’s important to have a strong grasp on the distinctions between them. Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May ... Jan ACV Bookings 12,000 Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 0 Recognized Revenue 516 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 484 Cash Collections 3,000 3,000 Let’s consider a hypothetical SaaS startup called RedRocket, which sells software for $12k per year, and asks its customers to pay each quarter. On the 15th day of January, one customer agrees to pay RedRocket $12k for a one year contract. The startup doesn’t sell any more software for the next twelve months. The table above demonstrates the differences in bookings, MRR, revenue and cash. The company books $12,000 in January. Bookings are the amount of money customers have committed to spend with the business. The sum total of future spend is booked in the month a customer signs a contract. Companies with only 12 month contracts can report ACV Bookings (Annual Contract Value); companies with other length contracts, both shorter and longer report TCV Bookings (Total Contract Value).  Sometimes startups normalize TCV into an annual number to report ACV. The company records $1k in MRR (monthly recurring revenue) in January. The MRR is the annualized spend of all customers divided by 12. RedRocket reports MRR at the end of each month. So in a year, assuming the customer doesn’t renew, MRR drops to 0. The company recognizes $516 in revenue in January, and $1000 in revenue each subsequent month, through the first fifteen days of next January. In January next year, the company recognizes $484 in revenue. Revenue can only be recognized for the days that RedRocket’s software is provided to the customer, in this January’s case, the last 16 days of the month (16 ÷ 31 x 1000 = $516). This amortization of revenue (and expenses) across time periods is called accrual accounting . The company collects $3k of cash up front from the customer, and then again three more times during the year each quarter. RedRocket’s cash collections should equal the incoming cash from customers into the company’s bank accounts. Cash collections exclude financings. The recognized revenue, bookings and cash collections numbers appear in a company’s financial statements. The recognized revenue is the revenue line item in a startup’s profit and loss statement. The cash collections is found in the cash flow statements (though it’s a bit hidden. See this overview to calculate it ). The size of a company’s total bookings backlog can be found in the deferred income line on the balance sheet, but it doesn’t necessarily correspond to annual bookings numbers (again ACV vs TCV). These concepts can be challenging at first, but all these numbers are important for startups to review regularly because each describes a different and important facet of the business.

“Is there a bubble?” is a question that seems to be asked every day. But it’s the wrong question - in fact, it’s an unimportant question. Maybe there is a bubble. Maybe there isn’t. Instead of asking the question, let’s just presume we are in a bubble. Then, the far more important debate surfaces: given the bubble, how should a team manage a startup differently? If I were to survey entrepreneurs and board members, I presume I would hear something like this list: First, a startup must think long term. No matter the uncertainties and the fluctuations of the market, the business must survive. To survive, a startup must build a differentiated product that customers want to use and buy. The company must offer the best product in the market. Second, the company must manage its cash effectively. The business must achieve profitable unit economics; only invest substantial dollars in marketing efforts with positive return on investment; curtail unnecessary expenses; collect cash from customers religiously; maintain an upside and a downside plan that ensures the business enough cash to survive in the downside case. Third, the startup should only hire the right people, and grow the team when justified by the needs of the business and the incremental revenue possibilities. Fourth, the startup must mitigate churn. Companies ought to build the best customer success organizations, structure pricing plans properly, plan the right product roadmap, cultivate a diversified customer base, and ensure customers achieve positive return on their investment. Fifth, the founders must raise capital opportunistically to amass a war-chest large enough to achieve their vision; and position the business so that it can always be in a good position to raise capital or cut costs to achieve profitability quickly, should the need arise. This means running an efficient go-to-market organization. In all likelihood, there are other ideas that would surface from such a conversation. But reading through the list you’ll notice, panic isn’t among the ideas. In fact, there’s nothing crazy at all in this list. All of these activities are things great startups do anyway, in any environment: think long term, manage cash well, build the best product, hire the right team and provide customers value. No one knows if there’s a bubble or if/when our presumed bubble will pop. The best we can do is build startups using sound principles and disciplined decision-making, with the aim of building sustainable, defensible businesses. Whether or not we’re in a bubble shouldn’t change those core tenets. So if we’re abiding by those principles, the question of are we in a bubble doesn’t really matter.

In the Innovator’s Dilemma for SaaS Startups , I outlined the path of many software companies, which disrupt incumbents by first serving the small-to-medium business and then move up-market by transitioning to serve larger enterprises with outbound sales teams. I argued this transition is largely due to the more attractive characteristics of larger customers, namely higher sales efficiency and reduced churn rates. This is the “traditional” way of disrupting. But, as Kenny van Zant of Asana and Mike Cannon-Brookes of Atlassian told me , there’s another way, a novel way of building companies that still isn’t very well understood: the Flywheel SaaS Company. The pyramid above describes the Traditional Model. A startup initially targets the SMB segment, develops a product to suit those customers and uses marketing to acquire large numbers of them. Eventually, the product improves, mid-market customers come calling, and the new inside sales team closes those customers which are primarily inbound leads. At some point in the future, the company decides it’s time to pursue enterprise accounts and hires an enterprise team. Those sales people are primarily outbound, sourcing, marketing and creating their own customer accounts. Most of the time, this enterprise sales effort operates independently of the existing marketing/inside sales effort. The Flywheel Model differs from the Traditional Model in one fundamental regard. The enterprise sales team is exclusively inbound. They are explicitly denied the option of seeking business outside the customer base, and must gin up business from only existing customers. The enterprise sales team is an up-sell and cross-sell team. In fact, so is the mid-market sales team. Only the SMB marketing team is permitted to acquire new leads. In short, the Flywheel flips the traditional idea of enterprise people as hunters and others as farmers . The marketing engine spins a customer acquisition flywheel that captures all kinds of customers, both big and small. Some of these customers are true small businesses; others are teams or departments in companies. Over time, the product spreads from team to team, and department to department, increasing customer size and revenue to the startup. It’s the responsibility of the mid-market and enterprise teams to find, cultivate and upsell these growing accounts. Atlassian has mastered this method and achieved terrific success, recording $215M in revenue, growing 44% in 2014. The chart above shows the company’s revenue growth since its founding in 2002, according to press reports. The company famously touts that it has grown without sales reps, precisely because its mid-market and enterprise teams farm exclusively within the pool created by the company’s marketing engine. The up-sell conversation is a very easy one: “Mr. CXO, there’s no need for a trial or feature comparison. 25% of your employees are already using our product.” What better argument for success is there than internal social proof? Flywheel models have a simple beauty about them. The entire company is focused on the same thing: building the momentum in one main customer acquisition mechanism. Additionally, this flywheel model is incredibly capital efficient. Atlassian raised its first venture round of $60M after being in business for 8 years and growing to $59M in revenue. In SaaS, the Traditional approach and the Flywheel approach both have led to the creation of some astounding companies. But sometimes, one model is better than another. Flywheel models work very well in sectors where the ultimate buyer has is very difficult to sell or market to, (e.g., product managers and engineers). The high customer acquisition costs of these customer types are driven by their software evaluation and product purchasing behaviors which differ from the norm. These customer segments often prefer educating themselves than relying on a salesperson. Engineers don’t buy software the way marketers do. In addition, Flywheel models work in markets where products can expand from any part within the continuum of SMBs to enterprise. A deployment can start with an individual, a team, a group, or the whole company and be successful. In contrast,  ERP software isn’t a flywheel business. Individuals don’t deploy ERP for themselves or their teams. ERP is monolithic, company wide software that is a top-down decision for larger businesses. Last, Flywheel models may not work as well when an industry has intense competition already pursuing a Traditional model. Relying on customers to self-educate, or awaiting products to percolate throughout an organization to grow customer accounts requires patience and time. Sometimes, top down sales may trump the bottoms up sales. However, if a Flywheel company’s product is significantly better, it can rally internal sentiment as a powerful sales tool during a bake-off between competing vendors. I believe very strongly that there are many different ways of building a business. I also believe we’re going to see more and more Flywheel SaaS companies in the future. It’s an elegant model to build a company, and I’m very grateful that Kenny helped me understand them better, and let me recreate the drawings he used to describe this model to me.

Sales cycles, the time from acquiring a lead to closing an account, vary quite a bit by industry, product type, and price point. But universally speaking for startups, shorter sales cycles are better.  Maintaining a short sales cycle is a competitive advantage for several important reasons. First, faster sales cycles accelerate the discovery of a repeatable sales process. Different sales approaches must be tested: which role to sell to? which pitch (cost or value)? how to handle particular objections? A 45 day sales cycle will find those answers twice as fast as a 90 day sales cycle. Faster and more frequent sales cycles enable quicker experimentation and ultimately a more rapid discovery process to the right initial sales process. Of course, this also extends to marketing. Faster cycles mean the quality of different lead sources can be evaluated nimbly and marketing experiments require less time to conclude. Second, faster sales cycles enable a company to more rapidly evaluate new sales candidates. With 45 day sales cycles, an inside salesperson’s performance can be evaluated in the first 4-6 months of their tenure. Six months is four full sales cycles back-to-back. If a sales rep can’t close a few deals in that process - they aren’t a fit. Third, faster sales velocity (the number of deals closed in a given month) is an incredible motivator. If sales cycles are short, account executives can quickly establish a sense of momentum, which makes the whole organization feel like it’s humming. Fourth, the faster the sales cycle, the faster the product improves. A startup develops a product offering and then takes it to market through its sales team. The sales team reverts back to the product team with market feedback. The quicker market feedback can be consistently incorporated into the roadmap, the more rapidly a company can improve its product. Fifth, faster sales cycles simplify financial planning. The company has better bookings and revenue predictability, which means they can more accurately forecast when to increase the size of the sales teams, when to increase marketing budgets, and so on. Predictable businesses are more attractive to investors, which simplifies capital raising. There are many other advantages to faster sales cycles. But I think this list is good enough to make the point. Whether deliberate or not, many startups price their initial products at substantial discounts to their future price points or their competitors. Often, this is a shrewd move because it helps startups accelerate their product market fit feedback cycles. Keep an eye on your sales cycles. Accelerating them can have a huge impact on your business.

How many companies sell each year for $1B or more? In the last ten years, on average, 2.5 US venture backed IT companies are acquired for $1B+. In the last ten years, a total of 20 companies have sold themselves for greater than $1B. Over the past 20 years, that trend has been relatively constant, with the exception of the euphoria in 1999 and 2000. The typical unicorn acquisition generates $1.9B in proceeds. Though there is quite a bit of variance in the trend, because the numbers of companies are relatively small, we cannot say that the typical large acquisition is increasing in size. It seems relatively constant around $2B. Each year for the past decade about $6.4B of total proceeds are generated from the sales of these companies. A greater than $1B acquisition event is an enormous event for the acquiring company. Often times, such an acquisition demands a significant amount of cash and stock as a fraction of total assets of the acquiring company. These are big, bold bets. As the aperture of innovation widens - we’re seeing new financial services companies, new logistics companies, etc - the possibility of more $1B+ M&A increases, because old world companies must evolve or become dinousaurs. So there is some reason to believe the M&A activity should increase. Additionally, large tech companies have huge piles of cash on their balance sheets. How the richest segment M&A market will evolve is anyone’s guess. If the past is any indication, we’ll see 2-3 $1B+ acquisitions each year yielding $10B in proceeds annually.

Performance reviews tax organizations, managers and employees to such an extent that some companies have abolished them outright . Reviews are emotionally complex conversations. Positive and negative feedback are intertwined with conversations about career progression, raises and equity grants. These meetings are emotional powder kegs; and it’s no wonder they stress us. In Work Rules , Google’s Chief People Officer Laszlo Bock, argues for a different type of performance review: a split review. At Google, “annual reviews happen in November, and pay discussions happen a month later.” There’s a theory underpinning this decision. We motivate ourselves by internal and external factors. The satisfaction of improving a skill is internal. A cash bonus is external. Self-improvement elicits better performance than compensation, but both motivators work. The problem, though, is when they are conflated. Research shows that external motivators can easily trump internal ones. In a review, it’s easy to focus on the compensation elements to the detriment of the personal growth feedback. So, most reviews end up being about compensation, rather than self-development. To quote Pasad Setty, another Googler in the People Ops team: “Traditional performance management systems make a big mistake. They combine two things that should be completely separate: performance evaluation and people development. Evaluation is necessary to distribute finite resources, like salary increases or bonus dollars. Development is just as necessary so people grow and improve.” I haven’t experienced a split performance review, but I hope to. The idea makes sense to me, and I suspect that having two conversations, one about internal motivators and one about external motivators, would have helped me focus more on personal development. Plus, splitting the conversations into a personal development conversation and a compensation conversation deflates a lot of the emotional tension and stress of the current way most companies do reviews. Would you prefer a split review?

In a post earlier this week, Josh Kopelman coined the term Private IPO to describe patterns in the runaway late stage financing market .  In addition to the points Josh makes about the dangers of stale valuations, there is another important and related implication for founders. When entrepreneurs pursue a Private IPO as the ultimate round before they go public, they make an implicit bet about the growth rate of their businesses: company revenues will more than double before a public IPO. If the bet doesn’t pan out, then the IPO is a down round - a fund raise at a lower share price than the last private round. This phenomenon isn’t uncommon. In fact, 25% of 2014 IPOs were down rounds , according to an analysis by Ben Narasin and Jeremy Abelson. Why is this the case? There is a substantial difference between the multiples investors pay in the private and the public markets. Internal Redpoint analysis concludes many private growth rounds occur at about twice the forward multiples of the public markets. Let’s make this more concrete. Suppose a company raises a Private IPO at 20x Enterprise Value / Forward Revenue multiple (close to the top of the private markets). When the company files for Public IPO, it will more than likely trade at somewhere in the 10x EV/FR multiple range, the industry average today for fast growth software companies . At half the forward multiple, the company must double revenues to be worth the same. This multiple disparity is very much a new phenomenon in the last few years. Some historical context: in the past, private markets paid smaller multiples than the public markets . After all, investors bear substantially more risk investing in startups than established businesses. Today, private market investors’ optimism has inverted the multiple curve, and earlier investors are valuing businesses at substantially larger multiples. This inverted multiple curve has created an investor risk bubble . Alarmingly, in the last year, the difference between private and public multiples has widened. While private multiples have remained constant, public software multiples halved . This multiple disparity creates a situation wherein entrepreneurs must make the implicit bet mentioned above. With each decrease in public market multiples, the growth requirement becomes larger. These Private IPOs and substantial growth rounds are terrific financial products for entrepreneurs. They enable founders to grow their businesses to massive scale through a far less taxing fundraising process than Public IPOs. But it’s important to reconcile the differences between public and private market multiples when considering valuations, and weigh the risks of the implicit bet a team makes on its growth rate when raising a Private IPO.

See also: Innovator’s Solution for SaaS Startups There’s a familiar path now to SaaS companies that start in the SMB (small-to-medium business) part of the market. Over time, they seem to inevitably begin serving larger customers. Box, Hubspot, Zendesk and among many others have exhibited this pattern. Why does this happen? I believe we’re seeing Clay Christensen’s Innovator’s Dilemma at play. In short, new startups leverage a distribution advantage to acquire SMB customers at scale. These distribution advantages take many forms: a simpler product (Box vs Sharepoint); mobile app store distribution (Expensify vs Concur); content marketing (Zendesk vs Oracle/Peoplesoft).  Early on, the SMB customers finance a startup’s growth and enable the startup to build a broader product over time that eventually becomes more attractive to enterprises. Because of the nature of SMBs, the startup must battle the higher churn rates of smaller customers which slow growth, creating the S curve above. At some point, the startup pursues the enterprise market to continue to achieve high growth rates with decreased customer churn. Smaller customers churn at higher rates. Below, I’ve created a table that shows my general observations about customer account churn rates by segment. Segment Monthly Customer Churn % Annual Customer Churn % SMB 3-7% 31%-58% Mid-Market 1-2% 11%-22% Enterprise 0.5-1% 6%-10% SMB customers tend to go out of business more frequently than bigger businesses. They switch products more regularly because switching costs are low. They simply aren’t as reliable customers as bigger companies. So they churn, and churn inhibits a business’s growth , and demand the business invest more capital to continue growing at the same rates. At some point, the total aggregate cost of the churn for an SMB business becomes so great that the company’s growth rate slows. It’s precisely then that a company should have an enterprise product in place. This is why the very largest enterprise software companies pursue the biggest customers; because they leverage the sales economies of larger accounts. Let’s contrast an inbound sales team at an SMB company and with an outbound sales team at an enterprise company where both companies spend the same per year in sales, about $0.75M. Inside Outside Annual Investment, $M 0.75 0.75 Total Compensation, $k 75 250 Number of Reps 10 3 ARR Quota, $k 500 2,000 Total Quota Capacity, $M 5.0 6.0 Customer Annual Churn 15% 7% 3 Year Value of Customer Base 1.1 5.2 3 Year Total Sales Production, $M 10.9 15.6 The inside sales people are paid $75k and the outside $250k. That implies 10 inside reps and 3 outside reps. The inside reps carry $500k quota; outside carries $2M quotas. The inside sales team serves customers that churn at 15% per year, compared to 7% for outside customers. If we calculate the value of each team’s customers over three years, factoring in churn, we see that the inside customers are worth $1.1M and the outside teams are worth $5.2M. Scaled for the number of sales people, the outside sales teams’ customers generate 42% more revenue for the same investment. Some startups pursue the enterprise part of the market immediately. But this often requires building a substantial feature set before the company can sell their product. Rather than invest several years to build an enterprise product broad enough to compete, many SaaS startups focus on the SMB part of the market. Small businesses have fewer demands and less sophisticated needs. Serving these customers finances the eventual development of an enterprise-grade product. The growth of the SMB customer base enables the company to grow revenues quickly and to raise its first few rounds of capital, and may even fuel it all the way through IPO. As a startup’s revenue grows and its product broadens to appeal to enterprise customers, the company can afford to trade the sales velocity and predictability of selling into the SMB and mid-market for the leverage and scale the enterprise market offers. At this point, the startup cedes the SMB market, creating an opportunity for a new entrant. The Innovator’s Dilemma starts all over again, leading to a new cycle of innovation. Note: I’m making a broad generalization in this post. Intuit and Xero are great counter-examples of companies who have become enormous businesses purely focused on the SMB. But they are very much exceptions. In addition, as Kenny van Zant points out, there is a different class of company that uses the inside sales methods to target department level sales, rather than SMBs, in which case the sales efficiencies and churn rates described above, don’t apply. Examples of this model include SolarWinds, the place Kenny and his team pioneered the innovative high velocity inside sales model.

In the Runaway Train of Late Stage Fundraising , I analyzed the growing disparity of the public and private markets. Ten years ago, we saw 2-10x as many IPOs as $40M+ rounds. Today, we see 16x as many $40M+ growth rounds as IPOs. There’s no question that companies are waiting longer to go public, fueled by late stage private investment. I was wondering if as a consequence, we might see bigger IPOs. Surprisingly, the answer so far is no. The chart above shows the average market capitalization at IPO for recent software IPOs. The figures are adjusted for inflation. Though the chart demonstrates some variance from year to year, there’s actually no statistically significant difference in the average market cap of a SaaS company going public today compared to ten years ago. It’s about $900M. When the companies do go public, they raise about $140M. Again, this amount when adjusted for inflation hasn’t changed over the past decade. Nor has the float (the fraction of share the business sells to raise money) changed materially over the same time period. In other words, public market investors are investing on the same terms in software companies today as a decade ago. One could argue that the majority of the private market darlings which has raised enormous war chests have yet to go public, and consequently haven’t impacted these figures yet. However, there are a few examples of such businesses which have gone out. Namely, New Relic ($215M raised, $1.0B market cap), Box ($561M raised, $1.6B market cap at IPO), HortonWorks ($200M raised, $0.6B market cap at IPO). We’re certain to see many more data points surface in the next year or two, and I’ll be keeping an eye on the trend. I’m curious if there is a correlation between dollars raised and market cap at IPO. Though I haven’t run the analysis, I suspect there likely isn’t because while some businesses do seem to require hundred of millions to go public, others like Veeva and Tableau make do on less than $20M each. So, given the data we have today, we have to conclude public markets are treating high flying software companies the same today as over the past decade, even if private market investors are far more bullish.

In 2013 with 40 employees, Stripe adopted email transparency , a policy that makes most emails public to everyone in the company. They posted an update in late 2014 about the success of email transparency with 164 employees. At first blush, it may seem radical to funnel emails of 164 other people to everyone’s already overflowing inbox. But it works brilliantly because it creates a policy around Institutional Memory, something very few companies do well. When I was a PM at Google, the company operated thousands of internal email lists, similarly to Stripe, but powered by a technology from Stanford called Mailman . There were all kinds of mailing lists: tactical, political, comical. When I started, I was told to copy the mailing list on each product team’s weekly meeting notes and other key conversations. It wasn’t until our team added a new member that the value of these email lists became apparent. During her first few days, she read through the notes stored in email archive. She understood the history of the project including the origin, the timeline, the original ambition. In addition, she internalized the context for the product and design decisions we had made, our key relationships with other teams, and many other nuances that would have taken much longer to appreciate without the email archive. Email transparency was just as valuable when I transferred a project ownership to another PM. All the context is indexed, searchable and permanent. Empowered and enabled, the new PM took the reins seamlessly in just a few days. Institutional Memory/Knowledge is one of the greatest competitive advantages a business builds. Many companies have unique expertise. Xero understands how to acquires SMBs through accountancies. WorkDay are masters of selling to large enterprises. New Relic, Twilio and Stripe market to developers better than anyone else. The unique insights for product, marketing and sales are each of these businesses greatest assets - they are the game plans for creating the strategic market advantage that led to their success. So much the better for the company if everyone in the business can operate with this knowledge. But very few companies invest the time to create and maintain this internal library because it requires time and effort. We all bristle at the idea of keeping wikis and intranets up to date. Email transparency is the most efficient way of building Institutional Memory because it’s mostly passive and integrated into our existing workflows. In addition to diffusing knowledge, email transparency brings a host of other benefits. It builds trust among team members, invites contributions from others outside the team, coordinates disparate teams better. It’s never too early to start building and archiving institutional memory. Stripe started at 40. Thanks to Dustin whose tweet inspired this post.

Every morning, it seems like a startup raises a massive growth round. In fact, the data proves the point. In 2014, there were 251 working days and 211 $40M+ growth rounds - just about one per day. In contrast to the frenetic private market, there were 15 US IT venture-backed IPOs with offerings greater than $40M last year, slightly more one IPO per month in 2014. Private market rounds were 14x as common as IPOs in 2014, compared to the 2004-2007 era, when IPOs were about as equally common as large private financings. As Bill Gurley wrote, “These large, high-priced private financings are the defining characteristic of this particular technology cycle.” In the past, companies went public to raise large amounts of capital, because the IPO markets were the only place to do it. Going public meant a lot of internal work preparing for regulatory scrutiny, but a substantial cash injection and shareholder liquidity. Today, that’s no longer the case. The private markets have supplied $7B in equity in the past two years, and the public markets provided $37B, a greater than 5X multiple. Before Lehman’s implosion, it was the other way around. Startups raised 3-6x as much capital in the public markets. Large private market financings are very attractive for startups. As the chart above shows, the average amount raised in a large growth financing of about $110M is roughly equal to the amount company could raise at IPO (setting aside the Facebook outlier in 2012). Why bother with the hassle of auditors and roadshows, when a company has to convince 40 or so public market investors to fill out a round, when one or two private investors will take the whole round after a few meetings? If high priced financings are the defining characteristic of this part of the technology cycle, one has to wonder what this private market exuberance implies for the next cycle. Glass half-full: we’re going to see a huge swath of IT IPOs in the next few years. Glass half-empty: many of the companies that have raised massive growth rounds won’t be financially fit enough to be able to go public, and investor/employee/shareholder liquidity will be a major challenge. The reality will bear out somewhere in between, and the limiting factor will be public market investor appetite for these tech companies. Of course, acquisitions will also become more common ( 2014 proved that trend ). It’s a very heady time for startups and investors. There’s a marked separation between the investment preferences of public and private investors. And while the initial data from the 2014 IPOs show private market investors still generate returns even when investing immediately before IPO , in many cases late stage private rounds are priced so aggressively that IPOs are down rounds. I’m not going to pretend to know how the future unfolds, or how the markets will evolve. The data shows, though, that the current investment levels aren’t yet justified by the exit environment. 231 companies raised $40M+ growth rounds in 2014. For comparison, roughly 240 VC backed IT companies have gone public in the last ten years. Said another way, we would need to 2x the number of IPOs in 2000 for all of these growth stage companies to become public. Who knows where this runaway train of financing will lead. It could be to one of the greatest exit environments in tech history or something much less rosy.

Like most things in a startup, a sales commission plan should evolve as the company scales. For example, as Mark Roberge, CRO of Hubspot, wrote in The Sales Acceleration Formula , Hubspot adopted three different sales compensation plans throughout its early evolution which embody the three key ingredients of a sales compensation plan. Hubspot’s first sales plan paid $2 of commission for every $1 of MRR an account executive booked. When the company decided to focus on revenue retention, the sales team adopted a new sales model. Account executives were divided into quartiles by customer retention. The top quartile received $4 of commission for $1 of MRR; the next quartile received $3, and so on. Hubspot’s third sales model paid $2 for every $1 of MRR, but not immediately. 50% of the commission was paid in the first month, 25% in the sixth month, 25% in the twelfth month - provided of course, the customer was still subscribed. Hubspot’s journey highlights the three key components of a sales compensation plan: commission ratio, acceleration and payment schedule. The commission ratio of a sales compensation plan equals the customer revenue divided by the sales cost for a year. In the case of the $2 commission for $1 of MRR, the commission ratio is 3.3, calculated in the table below. $2 for $1 Commission Plan Quota 400,000 Monthly MRR Quota 2,778 Monthly MRR Commission 5,556 Annual MRR Commission 66,667 Annualized Customer Revenue 216,667 Commission Ratio 3.3 I’ve assumed a quota of $400,000 in bookings for this AE, which implies a monthly MRR quota of $2.8k. If the AE achieves plan, the commission is twice the quota or $5.5k; multiplied for 12 months equals $67k. The annualized customer revenue is $217k, or the sum of MRR for all customers over the first year. This implies a 3.3 commission ratio. Most commission plans I’ve seen for inside sales teams maintain a commission ratio between 3 and 4. The lower the commission ratio, the more a company pays to each AE for a sale, and vice versa. Each company’s commission ratio will vary depending on quite a few factors. For example, lower commission ratios are common when salespeople are educating the customer base and experiencing longer sales cycles. Companies can sustain higher payment ratios when account executives can sustain high sales velocity - meaning they can close deals quickly. Ultimately, the sales commission plan has to balance the cost to the business and the ability of the account executive to earn market wage. Acceleration is  second part of the sales commission plan. Not all commission plans feature acceleration. Hubspot’s first plan doesn’t. If a sales rep closes 125% of quota, or $3.4k in a month, the sales rep receives $6.9k. However, it’s common to see accelerators. For example, if an AE closes 125% of quota, the rep would earn 125% commission or $8.7k in a month. On the positive side, accelerators reward above-quota performance. On the negative side, accelerators can encourage sandbagging - the practice of lumping contracts in one particular period to juice the commission payouts. Like any incentive, accelerators must be actively managed. Hubspot’s second commission plan employs accelerators, but based on a different axis, customer retention, rather than quota outperformance. This is a great example of how to align the incentives of the sales team with other parts of the business, in this case customer success. Payout timing is the third component of the sales compensation. Hubspot’s third plan delays the commission payout to encourage customer retention. Payment timing can also be used to encourage setting the right expectations with customers, pursue account expansion and promote renewal. Hubspot’s example shows the evolution of their sales plan and the way they embodied three key characteristics of a startup’s compensation plan. There is no global optimum for sales plans. They must evolve with time and reflect the needs of the business.

Whether implicitly or explicitly, it’s critical for a startup to map out accounts to understand the purchasing dynamics of a buyer. When sales teams start selling, their goal should be to create the sales playbook. The playbook all begins with understanding the key dynamics among the five players in the sales process. These are the five people: The Proponent of the Sale champions the sales. The Salesperson must equip this champion with all the tools to convince the other stakeholders to pursue the transaction. The Opponent of the Sale objects to the transaction. Opponents of the Sale exist in almost every software sale. Many different reasons fuel opposition to a sale. A head of engineering may prefer to build a technology in house. A head of finance may disagree with the financial benefits. A team lead may suffer decreased staff, decline in power or reduced importance reduced as a consequence of new software. The Decisionmaker is the ultimate person who must be convinced to invest the dollars to buy the software. The Decisionmaker may often have different perspectives than the Proponent of the Sale. Often, the Decisionmarker is the CEO or CFO. The other stakeholders vary by product, price and sales process. They can be other people and teams who are impacted by a new product: IT may have to integrate new systems. Marketing and Sales may have to change their internal processes when deploying a new CRM. The last person is the Salesperson, who as depicted above, must build as strong a relationship with all the key holders. Understanding the relationships in the sales process is key to creating a playbook. Scaling a SaaS sales process starts with mapping out the relationships with the key stakeholders.

If you want to understand how to build a great SaaS sales organization, you should read Mark Roberge’s The Sales Acceleration Formula . It’s the single best book on the topic. Mark is the Chief Revenue Office at Hubspot, a company which has created tremendous success by perfecting the inbound marketing plus sales model. The book is invaluable for every founder, CEO and member of the management team because it not only explains how the Hubspot sales team is structured, but why the structure came to be. The first employee at Hubspot and tasked with building the sales team, Mark developed a structured interview to qualify candidates and correlated the attributes of the best sales candidates. His list surprised me. Preparation, Adaptability, Domain Experience, Intelligence and Passion are the five characteristics of people most likely to succeed in Hubspot’s sales teams. With this knowledge in hand, Mark created a quantitative candidate assessment. Based on the linear regression mentioned above, the scorecard established hiring consistency and enabled the team to grow predictably. In addition, he shares the questions used to evaluate where a candidate falls along the spectrum of these five characteristics. The best part about this section is that it provides a framework for each company to determine the characteristics of the right sales people for their startup. The book reveals how Hubspot’s sales teams brought the same rigorous and quantitative mentality to training sales people, managing sales teams, developing compensation plans and cultivating sales leaders, critical topics that haven’t been discussed openly enough in Startupland. The book addresses the crucial relationship between the sales and marketing teams in SaaS companies, and describes the compact the sales and marketing teams at Hubspot reached to enabled each other to support and accelerate each other’s success. The image above describes an insight that formed the basis for the agreement between the sales team and the marketing team. In traditional Outbound Sales, leads are first screened for whether they are a good potential fit for a product, a task typically completed by the marketing team. The account executives must then determine whether the customer experiences enough pain in the status quo to buy a product. In Inbound Sales, the model Hubspot perfected, the lead qualification steps are reversed. Through content marketing and education, the marketing team creates a funnel of people who suffer from pain, and it’s the AEs who must test for product fit. This seemingly small difference is an important one, a wave whose ripples cascade through the organization. Because The Sales Acceleration Formula presents a series of logical and straightforward frameworks for constructing all the key disciplines of a startup’s sales team, I think it’s the single best book on SaaS sales, and every founder should read it.

In 2.5 years, Adobe has transformed its business from a software license business into a SaaS business. It’s been a remarkable transition, and one not talked about very much in the SaaS world. Transitions from licensed software to SaaS are rare. The travel and expense management behemoth, Concur, recently acquired by SAP for $8.3B , is another great example that made the transition first from CD-ROM packaged software, then to enterprise license software and then to SaaS. Above, the line chart shows the astounding growth in the number of Adobe Creative Suite subscribers from the launch of CreativeSuite 6 in mid-2012 through March 2014 growing at 31% per quarter to 3.97M in their last quarter. Generating about $4B annually, Adobe is worth $38B and employs more than 12,500 people. And in 2012, the company decided to disrupt its own businesses. The licensed software business, a cash cow, generated more than $3.4B in revenue in 2011 at 97% gross margin. As the plot above shows, the shift to SaaS was immediate in 2012. The company transitioned from packaged software to SaaS for Creative Suite 6, which Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, Premier and other content creation software. Only 30 months after launch, subscription revenues have outpaced license revenue at $2.1B and $1.6B respectively. The new SaaS business operates at 93% gross margins. As the number of subscribers has swelled, Adobe has been able to maintain a relatively high average revenue per user (ARPU) of $451 per year or $37 per month in the last quarter. The figure has fallen from the initial price points of $530 dollars, likely from volume discounts and greater penetration in education. The combination of subscriber growth and high ARPU has created a business that has grown from $0.1 to $1.8B in ARR in 11 quarters, implying a 30% compound quarterly growth rate over those 33 months. Adobe’s transition to SaaS is enabled by the company’s dominant product line for creative professionals. However, the transition hasn’t produced a meaningful increase in total revenue yet. As the chart above shows, the Digital Media business, the vast majority of which is CS6, has been flat to down for five years. Adobe’s future growth may lie more in it’s marketing software division which has doubled in the same time period and is itself a series of SaaS products. Nevertheless, in just about 5 years, Adobe’s transition from license software to SaaS will be complete, and Adobe will have been one of the few SaaS companies to manage to disrupt itself successfully.

Over the last 15 months, the typical high growth public SaaS company’s multiple has halved. The chart above plots the average enterprise value to forward revenue multiple for established SaaS companies and high growth SaaS companies. High growth companies peaked in February last year at about 22x forward revenues and have fallen to 11x on March 1, 2015. Established companies dropped similarly from 6.6x to 4.5x. The chart above shows the same figures per company. Drops are common across the board. The only companies with increases in multiples are Constant Contact (CTCT), BazaarVoice (BV), Qualys (QLYS), and ProofPoint (PFPT), none of which are High Growth companies, by this analysis’ definition. (The Box chart is empty because they’ve only just gone public.) One on hand, it’s never appealing for a company’s multiple to decrease. But on the other hand, this relative cooling of the shows that at least in the public market, investors aren’t falling over themselves to invest no matter the financials of a business. In other words, there’s no public market SaaS price bubble. This slight deflation is a healthy trend. While the public market seem to be lowering multiples, the private markets seem to be holding or increasing them as investors compete for the opportunity to invest in explosive-growth SaaS companies. The size and prices of Series B rounds have soared in 2014 and with it the forward multiples, in contrast to the public markets. It’s very unlikely that the private markets multiples will push the public ones upward, and much more likely that over time the public market will dictate the way SaaS companies are valued. Later stage investors will model their returns of a new investment based on the public market comparables. Eventually, because fund raising markets are like a train, this pressure should cascade to the earlier rounds. In short, lower multiples for publicly traded companies will exert downward pressure on the private markets. Or at least they should be. But from what I’ve seen so far in 2015, this isn’t the case. There’s as much enthusiasm and confidence in SaaS companies as there ever has been. There’s $50B of new cash to invest in venture stage companies. The combination of the two creates a tension between the public market and the private market multiples.

Leads are the lifeblood of every SaaS company. As a SaaS startup grows, the limiting factor of the business quickly becomes demand generation. Can the marketing team generate enough leads for the inside sales team to attain their monthly quota? The Marketing team’s mandate is to generate these leads in a cost-effective way and develop a portfolio of lead-generation mechanisms. Ideally, these generate inbound leads, who often convert at 2-3x the rate of outbound leads. Below are the five marketing channels I’ve observed at SaaS companies. Channels - In the world of licensed enterprise software, software companies pay channel partners called Value Added Resellers (VARs)  and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to sell, install and customize software. This notion doesn’t really exist with SaaS companies, because except for the most complex and customizable products like Salesforce, most SaaS software is much simpler. Very little integration is required because these products tend to stand alone, and customization and integration if needed are handled by internal engineering teams. But SaaS companies still do have channels available to them in the form of app stores from Salesforce, Intuit, Google and the Apple and Android mobile app stores. More importantly, Xero has demonstrated that service providers, accountants in this case can be amazingly efficient channels. The typical accountant using Xero refers between 6-31 customers to Xero depending on the geography (see slide 16). Xero convinces accountancies to adopt the platform and the accountants bring on their client base, creating huge leverage to grow efficiently. User Actions - Dropbox’s refer a friend program is the canonical example of a user action to generate new leads and customers. Many companies have adopted these ideas including Evernote, DigitalOcean, EventBrite and Elance . When crafted and deployed well, user actions and referrals are very efficient and effective ways of generating new potential customers. [But, referral marketing]	( http://go.extole.com/rs/extolehttps://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/Extole_2014_Referral_Guide.pdf ) has to be managed well because the fraud risk and consequent revenue cannibalization for the business can be material. Content Marketing - The newest of the marketing channels and still the least well understood channel, content marketing has blossomed because the software buying process has changed. Buyers want to educate themselves before engaging with a salesperson. Content marketing takes many forms: blogs, white papers, social media engagement, eBooks, videos and so on. Unlike the other forms of marketing listed here, content marketing is the only channel with compounding and long term returns . Because of its cost advantages, the only real costs are the salaries of the staff to create the content and the team to build/manage the syndication, testing and optimization tools, and occasional paid promotion of content, content marketing can be incredibly efficient. In addition, it can provide massive scale. Hubspot, which attracts more than 1M visitors to their blog each month, epitomizes this strategy. Last, the right kinds of content can generate leads for years, unlike the fleeting clicks of a paid marketing campaign. Advertising - AdWords, LinkedIn, Facebook ads. Internet/mobile paid customer acquisition varies in effectiveness by the type of product. The simpler and more consumer-like the product, the more likely paid ads are to immediately trigger a download or a signup. Paid ads are sometimes used to drive potential buyers to white papers and other content, but this can get pretty expensive really quickly. For example, to buy 100 clicks per day on AdWords, I would need to spend $470 daily, according to the Keyword Planner , or about $14k per month. If 10% of those who click fill out a lead form, and 50% of those leads are valid, and 15% of the leads convert to paying customers, then the marketing cost of customer acquisition is $626 (excluding the time and commission costs of the inside sales team member who closed the account). At those estimated rates, only BI products with annual price points of about $1k or more can justify the investment. Some advertising, like billboards on Highway 101, develop brand awareness, which is important in the long term, but isn’t a material driver of leads in short term. Events - In addition to attending major trade shows like Dreamforce, many SaaS companies have created their own events. In the customer success segment, Gainsight runs Pulse and Totango hosts Customer Success Summit . Events like these are a great way to reinforce a company’s brand message, engage the company’s external champions and retain key customers. But they can be expensive. For a 200-300 person event, budgets are typically in the $250k-$500k gross cost range, which can be offset by sponsorships. Given these costs, it’s often hard to back into a reasonable cost of customer acquisition from a dedicated event. So they must serve multiple goals. Smaller, more frequent events like Looker’s Look and Tell can also be effective customer engagement, education and closing tools. Great SaaS marketing organizations combine these different marketing channels and test them frequently. Having more than one marketing channel provides the marketing department several levers to pull when needing to accelerate lead volumes for the sales team. Have you been using any other novel marketing channels to grow your lead base? Let me know on Twitter .

Every SaaS company should be focused on mitigating churn because greater retention enables a business to grow far more rapidly , to reduce the cost of customer acquisition , and to slash the amount of capital required for the business to grow . But there’s one additional reason to focus on churn: predictability. The more dollar churn a business creates, the less predictable its performance - and vice versa. Let’s paint the picture for a hypothetical startup which generated $2M in revenue last year and forecasts growing to $5M this year for 150% annual growth. The chart above plots the Carry Over Revenue for the company as a function of annual dollar churn rate. Carry Over Revenue is the fraction of this year’s revenue generated by renewing customers. If the business achieves 0% dollar churn, 40% of this year’s revenue is already locked in (the company will generate $5M this year and renewal customers will pay $2M of it.) If, on the other hand, the company churns 50% annually, about 20% of revenue/$1M can be predicted on January 1, about half of the previous case. And if the company generates negative churn, where the  customer accounts increase in value over time, the carry over percentage grows to close to 50%. Of course, the faster a company grows, the smaller its Carry Over Revenue will be. For example, if the business were growing at 300%, at 0% churn the Carry-Over revenue would represent 25% of this year’s revenue. The goal isn’t to maximize Carry Over Revenue in the absolute. If a business achieves 100% COR, all of its business this year was last year’s business, then it won’t grow at all (unless the business has negative churn)! Rather, the aim should be to minimize churn to increase the business’ predictability. Predictable businesses are desirable businesses. If a startup can forecast to a greater accuracy how the business will perform, the startup’s management team can make better decisions about when to grow the team, increase marketing spend, raise capital among many other decisions. The company is one step closer to creating a money-making machine.

In a recent survey, 40% of VCs pointed to SaaS as the startup sector most likely to be impacted by a market correction. There’s no question that the early stage SaaS founders are benefiting from substantial multiple expansion and pre-money valuation increases. But I was curious about how widespread aggressive investments are in software companies. As the data below shows, the seed and Series A markets have been relatively stable, but Series B rounds have seen a dramatic acceleration recently. 845 software companies raised seed rounds in 2013, a 40% increase from the year before. But in 2014, that figure fell by 25% to 653. Meanwhile, Series As remained roughly constant from 2013 to 2014, and Series Bs rose by about 17%. In aggregate dollar terms, the seed market remained flat at about $700M. The Series A market, despite a 10% decline in deal counts, grew by about 5% to $3B in 2014. The Series B market exploded to $6.5B last year, growing by 66% annually, after having grown by 77% the year before. The typical SaaS/software company raised a $1.1M seed round, a $6.4M Series A, and a $19M Series B. Each of these round sizes increased year over year. The Series B rounds increased by more than 40%. The deluge of dollars flowing into the venture market seems to be fueling Series B rounds primarily. Total investment has doubled, driven primarily by larger rounds in roughly the same number of companies. In other words, the early market leaders are rewarded handsomely with larger investments at better terms. This concentration of dollars in the Series B market, driven by competition, continues to drive valuations and multiples ever higher. And consequently, if multiples were to suddenly recede, it would be the Series B rounds that would likely see the greatest fall in size and investment pace.

When you walk into Looker’s offices , the first thing you’ll see are the surfboards standing in a corner, still sandy from a morning’s outing. Looking around, you’ll notice the sunny outdoor patio where a chef once made enough paella in one enormous paellera for Looker’s 100 employees, and you might sit at the long tables where they shared the feast. As you entered the building, you would have passed a motorcycle glinting in the sun, a gift from the company to an early engineer for his outstanding contributions to the business. Walking inside, you’ll see all the Looker team members wearing t-shirts of their customers . All around the office, you can feel the culture Frank, Lloyd and the rest of the Looker team have imbued into company from the very earliest days. Today, Looker is announcing a $30M round, 400% annual growth and an impressive customer list that includes  unicorns and publicly traded companies . As a student of SaaS companies, I can say with confidence the numbers behind the business and the company’s progress are very exciting. But the most special thing about Looker isn’t the numbers. Instead, it’s the unique chemistry of the team who have built Looker into what it is today; it’s this distinct culture that will accelerate and transform the business tomorrow. It’s the company’s relentless focus on defining its success by the success of its customers. Days like this that remind me that the most important things for startups have never been the numbers; they’ve always been the people and the culture.

There’s a magical property to the classic sales funnel SaaS startups use to evaluate the effectiveness of their go-to-market organizations: an increase in effectiveness at any stage of a sales funnel cascades through to the end funnel. But improvements to the early parts of the funnel are more important than those later in the funnel, because they meaningfully improve key SaaS metrics like cost-of-customer acquisition and pay-back period. Most startups employ a four stage funnel: prospect, lead, opportunity, customer. Typically, a prospect is an email of a potential customer. A Sales Development Rep (SDR) qualifies the prospect to a lead. The lead is then passed to an Account Executive (AE) who qualifies it further into an opportunity and works to close the deal, yielding a customer. The yield from one part of the funnel varies quite a bit depending on the startup’s sector, how the business acquires leads, the competitive dynamics in the sector and the qualification regimen of the company. Let’s compare three different funnels each starting with 1000 leads and yielding 125 customers. Funnel 1 pushes 50% of leads through each step. In Funnel 2, SDRs filter 70% of prospects up-front. In Funnel 3, Account Executives whittle down the high volume of SDR-qualified leads late in the process. Funnel Prospect Lead Opportunity Customer 1 1000 500 250 125 2 1000 300 150 125 3 1000 750 500 125 For each funnel, we’ll improve yield at a different step. In Funnel 1, the prospect-to-lead ratio increases by 10%. Same for Funnel 2’s Lead-to-Opportunity ratio and Funnel 3s Opportunity to Customer Ratio. Funnel Prospect Lead Opportunity Customer 1 1000 550 275 137.5 2 1000 300 165 137.5 3 1000 750 500 137.5 No matter where the incremental 10% improvement occurred in the funnel, the business benefits from a 10% growth in customers. This conclusion can be counterintuitive at first, but it works because of the commutative property of multiplication . For startups, this hypothetical implies that any efficiency or yield improvement in the sales funnel is equally as valuable as another of the same magnitude. But consider the question of time efficiency for a startup. Let’s assume an SDR requires 5 minutes to evaluate a prospect, an AE needs 30 minutes to qualify a lead to an opportunity and the AE invests 4 hours to convert an opportunity to a customer. The table below shows the total hours required by each step. Funnel Lead Opportunity Customer Total SC CAC ($) 1 83 275 825 1183 403 2 83 150 450 683 229 3 83 375 1125 1583 543 The third funnel is 2x more expensive in time as the second requiring 1583 hours to produce 137.5 customers compared to 683 hours. The sales-contribution to the cost-of-customer-acquisition which is abbreviated SC CAC in the table above, increases from $228 to $543 for Funnels 3 compared to 2. In other words, this time efficiency doubles how much money the sales team invests to acquire a customer. Keeping the SC CAC low will increase payback periods, sales efficiency and many other go-to-market metrics, enabling your startup to grow faster with less capital required. This is why investing in improvements at the top of the sales funnel, particularly in early prospect and lead qualification are so valuable: they save the time and energy of a startup’s go to market teams and can meaningfully improve unit economics.

Over the past four years, the amount of seed investment has increased by more than 200% . And the typical seed investment size has risen by 25% in just the last 12 months . In 2014, for the first time in four years, median Series A round size have increased. When we analyzed the data last year, this wasn’t the case . But in 2014, the median Series A hit $6.8M, increasing 14% over the trailing three year average. These larger seed rounds aren’t elongating the period between seed and Series A. The typical startup raises their A about 400 days, or 13 months, after the close of their seed, just the same as four years ago. And the correlation between seed round size and series A round size is still weak: the R^2 is about 0.35, a figure which has actually declined over the past four years. So larger seed rounds aren’t correlated with larger Series As. Startups are raising larger Series As for two reasons. First, startups are growing faster than ever before . Second, investors have raised huge amounts of capital. In 2014, VCs raised close to $50B, nearly 2x more than the median over the last 15 years, and half the amount in 2000. This increased competition increases prices. Series Bs and Series Cs have increased in size over the past few years , and so have seeds. But 2014 was the first year in which the Series A round size grew. All this data underscores how fertile a fundraising environment exists for founders. Round sizes, valuations and numbers of rounds are all expanding quickly. Part and parcel of this expansion are more competition for talent and real estate and more competitors in attractive sectors and consequent greater startup operating costs .

After writing about the Seed Market in 2015 , I wondered whether I could find some data to support Sam Altman’s observation that acquihires have fallen in frequency over the past year by 66-75% . The chart above shows an estimate of the acquihires in US technology companies over the past four years. There is no perfect data set on acquihires because many of these transactions are never announced. So this estimate, which I created using Crunchbase data, likely underestimates the total number of acquihires in every period. To calculate the data, I filtered all the startups who had been acquired for undisclosed amounts and raised less than $6.5M (the sum of the average seed round in 2014 and the median series A ). Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Acquihires 59 64 67 68 61 Over the past four years, on average 15 companies are acquihired each quarter. And on an annual basis, the cadence of acquihires is steady, in the high 60s. 2014 saw a modest drop to 61. As the chart above shows, the three first quarters of the year exceeded the average and Q4 recorded ten. This drop could be an actual decrease. Or it could be caused by a delay in the announcement of these acquisitions. Wrapping up the paperwork can take time. If the data does hold, then there would seem to be a decline in acquihires, but that decline isn’t unprecedented. Q2 2010, Q2 2011 and Q2 2012 all saw similar drops before the levels rebounded. In fact, Q2 is consistently the slowest quarter in each year, excluding 2014, possibly due to the impact of summer vacation. However, there is a consistent pattern elsewhere in the acquihire market. Startups are raising less and less before being acquired. The line above charts the slow, but consistent decline in the median amount raised by the acquihired companies. In 2010, the median was in the $3-4M range. In 2014, that figure is in the $1-2M range. This may indicate a new strategy by the acquirers’ corporate development teams. Instead of acquiring companies after the Series A, as they did in 2010 and 2011, these corp dev groups are pursuing talented companies after the seed. Because there are fewer investor dollars in, these acquirers may be able to pay less for the same talent. Or perhaps, the acquihire market has grown more competitive and corp dev teams acquire earlier. Or perhaps, startups founders understand better when their idea or technology or team is better suited as part of a larger entity sooner. There is no great data set to analyze the acquihire market. But these estimates from Crunchbase indicate that the acquihire market slowed a very small amount in 2014, caused by a deceleration in Q4. The competition talent market shows no signs of slowing down, and competition fuels the acquihire market. Unless there’s a material change in talent or a set of new acquisition strategies employed by the big technology companies, I don’t expect much of a change in 2015.

A few weeks ago, I joined Mike Volpe, CMO of Hubspot, on the Growth Show where we had a great time talking about a few SaaS topics. A few listeners to the podcast picked a line from that podcast that I think is a really important point for content marketing. I said, “Content is one of the few forms of marketing that has a compounding return.” Like a bank account that starts out small and earns incremental gains, but over time becomes quite large, content marketing efforts require consistent investment but ultimately can yield enormous results. Hubspot’s efforts prove the maxim. The attract more than 1M readers per month to their blog . I’m going to use some of my own data and some hypothetical data to prove the point. Content isn’t just relevant for a day. Only about 1/3 of the views on a typical post on tomtunguz.com are generated on the first day. In fact, the chart above shows the probability density function for the share of page views by blog post for the past year. The chart shows that the typical blog post will generate between 1x and 2x as much traffic with time. When creating a content marketing campaign, marketers must be deliberate about their balance between evergreen content, posts that are always interesting for readers, and temporal content, posts that are relevant just for a day or two. Evergreen posts often confer timeless advice. Temporal posts comment on recent events. Content marketing campaigns that skew in favor of more evergreen content will grow faster and bigger than those which focus on temporal content. Let’s contrast two hypothetical blogs. The first blog is an evergreen focused blog. Each post generates about 150 views on day one, and about 20 each subsequent day. Posts views decay according to a modest decay function, but still generate about 18 views per day a year later (this decay constant is based on this blog, but the figures are different.) You can see the compounding effect clearly. In a year, the blog is generating more than 250k visitors per month. Remember, this is a hypothetical example, with perfect execution. But the idea still holds. Content marketing value compounds. Contrast the evergreen strategy with a temporal strategy. In this example, each blog post generates about 150 posts on the first day, 20 on the second day, but the decay function is much more aggressive. By the end of the year, each post generates 1 view per day. This blog’s traffic caps out at about 70k visitors, less than a third of the previous one. In reality, content marketing campaigns balance evergreen and temporal content. While it may not generate long term returns, temporal content keeps blogs fresh. But to benefit from the compounding effects of content marketing, marketers should actively invest in building evergreen content that keeps contributing to traffic growth, building the company’s brand and eventually generating sales.

The seed stage investment market feels like it’s changing quickly. Last year and the year before, the institutional seed investor came to the fore. These firms raised between $5 and $75M to invest in seed stage companies. In addition, VCs have been participating in the seed stage market as well, making 2013 a banner year for seed investment. Startups raised 132% more in seed rounds than in 2012 . But what of 2014? And what does it mean for 2015? Year Number Total Invested, $M Average Round Size, $k 2013 1531 1255 820 2014 1265 1272 1006 2014 saw 18% fewer investments, but an equal amount of investment at $1.3B. Interestingly, the average round size increased by 25%. The table above uses Crunchbase data as a proxy for the seed market. It includes only US technology companies. The larger round sizes shouldn’t be much of a surprise. Round sizes have increased in most fundraising stages , likely because 2014 was a decade high year for VC fundraising. Also, we’ve correlated larger seed rounds with greater Series A success in the past. Great companies attract more capital and great companies raise enough to ensure they can achieve the right milestones for the next round. As for 2015, the data indicates seed investors are concentrating their investments in fewer deals, but willing to invest more. Roughly 2-3 years have passed since VCs and newer institutional seed investors have aggressively pursued seed investments. And consequently, investors have seen successes and failures, both of which inform their investment strategy. In addition, as Sam Altman pointed out yesterday, the dynamics of the M&A market feel like they are changing: anecdotally, it seems talent acquisitions are down at least 2-3x from a year ago — Sam Altman (@sama) March 2, 2015 If true (I wish I had the data to prove it), this trend alters seed investment math quite a bit, because companies which don’t work out won’t return capital to investors. This is perhaps another reason to concentrate more dollars in fewer companies. If seed rounds continue to expand, as I expect it will, the $2-3M seed round will become increasingly common and eventually revive the old-school Series As that have been replaced by $7-10M Series As of the past year years. A rung on fundraising’s Jacob’s Ladder will flip. Given the at least decade high volumes of capital in the seed market, the 2015 seed market should be just as strong as the 2014 and 2013 seed markets. Larger rounds will likely be the norm, providing startups more time to prove out milestones and raise the next round of financing. On the other hand, what that next round will be called by the end of 2015, whether it will be a Series A or Series B, is impossible to predict. – A note about the analysis. Crunchbase data accuracy increases with time as more funding announcements are made and more seed investment details are revealed. Crunchbase data in the previous quarter underestimates seed rounds by about 45%, and by about 20% for the quarter before . I adjusted February 2015 Crunchbase data in this way to create the 2014 analysis.

Once a startup has found an initial product market fit, the business must evolve the way it models its growth. Before product market fit, a startup’s financial projections focus on costs. The company has no visibility into their revenue growth. So, the management team should minimize costs, maximize cash and lengthen runway to provide as much time as possible to find that product market fit. As we’ve seen, staff are both the greatest asset of a business and also the greatest cost, at least initially , and modeling those is straightforward. But when a repeatable sales process seems to have been discovered, it’s time to develop the startup’s revenue forecast. Revenue forecasts accuracy won’t ever be perfect, but they do serve the purpose of communicating to the management team and the board the way a business plans to grow. Additionally, and equally importantly, revenue forecasts provide a mechanism to articulate how much investment a revenue dollar requires. In other words, how much cash investment is required to double or triple or quadruple revenues in the next year. At the core of effective revenue forecasts lie the Fundamental Unit of SaaS Growth . The Fundamental Unit of SaaS growth is the atomic go-to-market team of a startup. For example, one Sales Development Rep (SDR), one Account Executive (AE), half of a customer success manager’s (CSM) time. Of course, each company’s fundamental unit will vary in composition. When modeling a startup’s growth, a team should be asking themselves, how many Fundamental Units do we need to hit $1M in ARR, $5M in ARR, $20M in ARR? How much cash do we need to hire those teams? How much time, how many quarters do we need to recruit and train those teams and their managers? The revenue model a startup creates should output two key items: the revenue contribution potential and the associated costs of the company for a year or two in the future. The revenue contribution of a fundamental unit is the MRR the AE/SDR/CS combination produces. As a startup hires more fundamental units, the costs increase linearly. But because of the nature of subscription businesses, the revenues should increase super-linearly. Conceptualizing a company’s revenue growth in teams, rather than individuals recognizes the interdependence of internal teams in SaaS companies for the business to succeed, and is one of the most effective ways I’ve seen to model the revenue growth of a SaaS company going to market with sales teams.

In The Shape of Things to Come , the New Yorker profiles Sir Jony Ive, the man they call Apple’s greatest product. Ive is iconic. His products have been sold 1.5 billion times. For all of his success, Ive’s personality isn’t well known. Neither is his personal history. Or how he manages the Apple Design Lab. The New Yorker article reveals some of these three things. Here are some of my favorite quotes. On Ive’s first meetings with Jobs in 1997 Jobs visited the design studio and, as Ive recalled it, said, “F**k, you’ve not been very effective, have you?” This was a partial compliment. Jobs could see that the studio’s work had value, even if Ive could be faulted for not communicating its worth to the company. During the visit, Ive said, Jobs “became more and more confident, and got really excited about our ability to work together.” That day, according to Ive, they started collaborating on what became the iMac. Soon afterward, Apple launched its “Think Different” campaign, and Ive took it as a reminder of the importance of “not being apologetic, not defining a way of being in response to what Dell just did.” On managing the Apple Design Studio and the importance of brutal intellectual honesty Ive encourages candor. “We put the product ahead of anything else,” he said. “Let’s say we’re talking about something that I’ve done that’s ugly and ill-proportioned—because, believe you me, I can pull some beauties out of the old hat. . . . It’s fine, and we all do, and sometimes we do it repeatedly, and we have these seasons of doing it—” “I had one last week,” Akana said. “Which one?” he asked. “The packaging thing,” she said. “That’s true,” Ive said, laughing. “It was so bad.” A detail about his personality Ive flicked through a sketchbook, giving me time to see that, like Leonardo da Vinci, he sometimes uses brown ink. On his design philosophy The goal, Ive said, was to create “the strangely familiar.” The profile also exposes quite a bit about the history of the Apple Watch and some of the design decisions which created the Digital Crown. For example, do you know why the Digital Crown isn’t the crown centered vertically on the Apple Watch? And why is it closer to the screen than the back of the watch? Anyone passionate about design or creating a design-focused culture at a company should read the article because it exposes at least a bit about the dominant design culture at Apple, a company which has masterfully combined design and marketing to become the largest technology company.

If I were asked to create a content marketing strategy for a person or a business from scratch, I would craft a strategy with three dimensions: customer segments, customer lifecycle stage and content type. **Customer Segments: **Product managers/marketers are responsible for identifying the most important customer segments a startup will pursue. Picking the right customer segments increases profitability , maximizes market size and prioritize the most attractive customer for the business. Very few businesses target only one type of customer. Market places cater to buyers and sellers. SaaS companies may pursue small, medium and enterprise customers, many times across industry categories. Even pure consumer businesses like social networks can divide their user bases intteoateno celebrities, influencers, and the common user, for example. Content marketing efforts must reflect the core strategy of the business and prioritize the most important few segments. The content a startup produces must resonate with these target segments. It’s not to say each blog post or tweet must strike a chord with every segment each time, but that there ought to be some content for targeting each segment specifically. Customer Lifecycle: Before buying a product, a customer progresses through a journey. They educate themselves about a space to understand whether they have a need. They understand the key attributes of products in the sector. Next, they make a buying decision. Then, they may try to maximize the value of the product. Last, the customer may be unsatisfied and possibly churn. Ideally, each of these stages of the lifecycle, for each of the key customer segments mentioned above, should be handled by content marketing in some form. Zuora’s three doors concept is a good example of this value proposition delivered in a website. Content Types: Great content marketing strategy should leverage all of the available tools to maximize success. First, teams should vary content types. For example, in a blog writers should vary interviews, lists, how-tos, personal interest stories. Each format provides a unique view into a space and a company’s position within it. Content marketing doesn’t stop at blogging and social media. Events are powerful tools for content marketing which blend a company’s voice with influencers’ voices and customer points of view. This social proof is a powerful force for sales. Look at most SaaS websites today’s including Looker’s , and you’ll see the value proposition is quite often articulated by the company’s customers. Content in customer support canned responses, in product messaging, company communities and help pages are often forgotten places for content marketing efforts to shine and potentially retain customers at risk of churning. Mailchimp does this well. When a Mailchimp customer’s email list grows, the Mailchimp team automatically sends an email congratulating the company on its success. Note the company never mentions the increase in cost to the customer, instead focusing on the customer’s success. It’s ingenious. The most sophisticated content marketing strategies consider these three factors and the teams develop a content marketing calendar that creates a steady drumbeat of relevant material for each segment, at each of the key stages in the lifecycle, while varying the delivery mechanism. These three dimensions (segments, lifecycle, content type) can create quite a bit of complexity very quickly. Most startups tend to focus on one segment across a lifecycle for a few content types. As the content marketing team grows, so does the complexity. But this framework provides one roadmap for how to start from a simple content marketing program and evolve into a complex but well orchestrated strategy.

In 2009, the Corporate Executive Board, a consultancy providing expertise to some of the world’s largest companies, studied the distinguishing characteristics of great sales people and well-run sales processes . They surveyed more than 6,000 sales reps across 90+ businesses. The analysis revealed three interesting things. First, most customers don’t perceive a difference between competitive products. Over and over we found that customers, generally speaking, see significantly less difference between us and the competition than we do ourselves. It’s not that they think most suppliers are particularly bad on brand, product, or service. It’s just that [customers] don’t think [suppliers are] particularly different. Second, the most important factor in a purchasing decision is internal consensus that a vendor is the right one for the job.  Salespeople must engender solidarity among the group that will report their findings to the ultimate decision-maker. Third, given those two hurdles, what types of sales people and sales process work best and most consistently across industries and products? The CEB’s analysis found five types of sales people, one of which one stood out: the Challenger. The CEB clustered salespeople into Challengers, Lone Wolves, Hard Workers, Problem Solvers and Relationship builders. The figure above shows Challenger reps represent 23% of the surveyed population, but 39% of top performers. Lone Wolves are 15% of salespeople, but 25% of top performers. What distinguishes Challenger sales people? According the CEB’s analysis, Challengers sell by teaching, tailoring and controlling the sales process. Challengers pitch customers in five steps. First, instead of asking, “What problems do you, the customer have?” Challengers, they warm up the prospect and build credibility by providing some relevant data or insight. Next, and this is the most important part, they Reframe the conversation. They teach the customer that their current world view is flawed in some way. This judo move changes the power dynamic in the relationship. The salesperson becomes an expert and the customer wants to continue the conversation to learn more about why their current worldview isn’t optimal, and how to fix it. The next three steps of the Challenger sales process are similar to other models of selling. Next, Challengers salespeople Prove the Business Case. Fourth, they Emotionally Involve the customer in the story, crafting a narrative in which the customer identifies with the pain points and comes to believe his/her worldview needs to evolve. Last, the sales rep paints the New Way Forward, in which the product plays a key role. Challengers are effective sales people in low complexity products, but outshine the other types in complex products. Of course, successful salespeople come in all forms. But it’s interesting to see the CEB’s conclusions about the Challenger salesperson as a disproportionately more effective sales technique.

In “The Rule of 40% for a Healthy SaaS Company,” Brad Feld shared a simple rule of thumb growth investors often apply to judge the attractiveness of a $50M business. “The 40% rule is that your growth rate + your profit should add up to 40%.” I was curious if this theory were broadly true, applicable for growth stage companies Brad mentioned, but also early stage companies. So, I calculated this metric, which I’ll call the GP metric in this post, for all the publicly traded SaaS companies over their lifetimes. The chart above plots the median GP metric by years since founding. I’ve added a horizontal line at 40%. The GP metric trends from 100%+ to about 30% over about 15 years. As Brad wrote, growth investors apply the 40% rule to companies with $50M+ in revenue, which is right around year five or six of most of these businesses , to quickly figure out if the high level financial profile might be a fit for them.  And the median figures in years six and later seem to support the case that the rule of 40% might be a good filter for investors in later stage companies to identify outliers because the median decreases as these businesses mature, and a 40% floor would surface more attractive companies. In the early days of a company’s life, though, the median GP metric is substantially greater, often exceeding 100%. In fact, it ought to be as high as possible. Larger values imply the business is growing quickly and/or generating lots of profit. For example, Workday charted the biggest GP figure in this data set of 189% in 2010 when the business grew from revenue by 252% and recorded net income of -57%. As they age, many public SaaS companies haven’t been able to sustain a 40% GP metric. This chart shows the median score for each company across the number of years which they have provided data to public market investors. All of these companies are worth several hundred million to many billions of dollars. As Brad pointed out, the spirit of the Rule of 40% is a good one. The Rule establishes a relationship between the growth rate and burn rate of a business and defines a healthy operating zone for a growth stage business. Consequently, the Rule of 40% metric may be a solid first pass filter for a growth equity investor to determine whether a business might be a good investment candidate. But for early stage companies, whose GP metric may exceed 100% or more, founders should focus more on the unit economics (average revenue per customer, cost of customer acquisition, churn rates, contribution margin), which drive the business’s top line and bottom line. Everything else will take care of itself.

It’s becoming more and more expensive to scale a startup in San Francisco. In fact, it’s twice as costly to operate a startup in 2014 as it was in 2009. According to data from Jones Lang LaSalle, office prices in San Francisco have nearly doubled in five years from $36 per square foot per year to $63. Typically businesses allocate about 150 square feet of office space per employee. Given the market rate for office space and annual salaries, hypothetical 20 person Series A startup will spend about $200k per year per employee in 2015. In parallel, startups and incumbents vying for talent in the increasingly competitive job market have bid up the median wage of a San Francisco technology worker 15% each year, from about $90k to well over to $180k in 2014. Wages include salary, benefits, stock options and perks. Wages constitute the majority of the increase in startup expenses. Real estate costs add only 5% of per employee costs. The combined inflation of real estate and wage costs have a dramatic impact of the operating expenses of startups. The chart above compares the op-ex (excluding marketing spend) of a hypothetical 20 person Series A startup and a hypothetical 80 person Series B startup over the past five years. In both cases, the op-ex figures double from $2.5M to $5.0M and from $7.9M to $15.6M respectively. The cost savings startups achieve from cloud computing infrastructure or other technology cost reductions are dwarfed by the steady cost increases of labor in particular. These heightened costs of doing business may explain some of the increase in startup round sizes. Of course, 2014 was the best year for venture fundraising in more than a decade and more venture dollars pursuing more startup opportunities in the Bay Area means even greater demand for top talent. It’s quite likely that the substantial injection of venture dollars into the ecosystem are creating the market dynamics that increase startup costs. Consequently, it’s not unreasonable to expect wage inflation and consequently higher startup operating costs to continue.

After a SaaS startup has achieved some degree of product market fit, the business will likely ramp the go-to-market teams, and in particular the sales team. Measuring and tracking the performance of a growing sales team is critical to the growth and financial health of a business. The report above is the most effective view of the performance of a sales team I’ve found for SaaS startups. A VP of Sales at a Redpoint portfolio company introduced this report to me, and now I can’t live without it. Let me quickly describe the report. On the left, the names of all the sales are listed in order of tenure. The letter after their name indicates inside sales (I) or outside sales (O) rep. The fiscal year quarter is listed across the top. The percentage within each cell conveys the fraction of quota achieved in that period. The last column contains the pipeline to quota ratio - the total qualified pipeline of the salesperson for the quarter divided by their quarterly quota. Edward Tufte , master of information design, would be proud of this report because it conveys at least four different things about the health of a sales team succinctly. Team Composition First, the report indicates the number of the inside and outside sales reps. In this chart, the letter following the names of these hypothetical sales reps indicates 4 inside sales reps and 3 outside sales reps. Team Tenure Second, the report conveys the state of the sales team. The startup has five ramped sales people and two new sales people one quarter into their two quarter ramp. Past Team Performance Third, the report displays the current and historical performance of the sales team across many different dimensions. The sales team in a worrisome state. Let’s walk through some analysis of individual rep performance: Only two reps exceeded their quota during their two quarter ramp (Cailin and Roberta). Most of the others missed quota substantially, which raises the question: is sales on-boarding and training effective? Only one rep, Roberta, consistently beats quota. Sarah looks like she might be a strong performer. The jury is still out on Holden and Laurence and Sarah. It’s not clear how deep the sales bench is and how much hiring/firing the company will need to do in the next six months. Q4 2014 was a good quarter for most ramped salespeople. Why? Did the company run a sales promotion? Or did a new feature launch? The outside teams seem to outperform the inside sales teams. This could be because the product is a better fit for larger customers; or it could be because the startup hasn’t found the right profile for hiring inside sales people; or the inside sales leads aren’t good quality; or many other reasons. Nevertheless, it’s worth further investigation. Finally, three of five reps exceeded quota last quarter, which is average. Most sales teams see about 60% of their reps achieving or exceeding quota. Next Quarter’s Numbers Fourth, the Pipeline/Quota ratio provides some insight into whether the company will achieve its plan next quarter. Ideally, we would see greater than 3x coverage for all the teams. Cailin  blew out Q4, but Q1 doesn’t look very promising for her because she closed all her good leads in Q4 and her pipeline is thin. Same for Roberta. Holden looks to book another good quarter. But on the whole, the sales team pipelines aren’t as healthy as the company might hope, which means Q1 2015 bookings will probably be lower than planned. This presentation of sales team performance is the most effective I’ve seen. In a single chart, a management team and a board can perform first-pass evaluations of the sales hiring and on-boarding processes, the depth of the sales team, the consistency of performance and the probability of the company achieving its plan next quarter.

In 2011, a team of researchers from Stanford and Harvard led by Teresa Amabile collected daily work journals from more than 250 people at large and small companies in a variety of roles. In each journal entry, an employee described one work event that stood out that day. Over the course of a few months, the study received more than 12,000 responses.  From all this data, the team revealed a critical ingredient to be a great manager: managing for progress. To be happy and be fulfilled at work, people want to feel they are advancing, getting things done, and making an impact. But it’s not enough to simply to receive a pat on the back and a word of encouragement. Rather, we respond much more positively to feedback from the work itself. When we have achieved a goal like closing a sale, writing code that passes the test harness and is pushed to production, releasing a new feature that a million users touch every day, our happiness at work blooms. The best managers craft roles and assign projects that position their teammates to see and feel the result of their work directly. Without this direct or near-direct feedback, it’s easy to feel like we’re all cogs in a machine, and the work we complete disappears into the ether. Even if these are small wins, these tasks create a sense of momentum, progress and fulfillment. Of course, every person in every company will face setbacks. The ratio of wins to setbacks governs how happy and consequently, how productive team members are. Understanding the impact of loss aversion at work is important to maximizing employee happiness. Loss aversion , a theory proposed by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, shows losing $100 decreases happiness more than a $100 gift increases happiness. Similarly, a setback at work diminishes employee happiness more than twice as much as a win increases it. To feel great at work, the authors argue employees need twice as many wins as losses, even if those wins are very small. I bet the precise ratio doesn’t matter all that much, it’s more the general feeling of more wins than losses. The research opened my eyes to the importance in crafting a role in the right way and also underscoring the importance of managing employee’s win vs setback rate to make sure teams are performing well. After all, progress is the antidote to burnout.

SaaS companies are marvelous businesses. They are more predictable than most other kinds of companies and in addition they demonstrate leverage from technology. The best SaaS companies are able to build strong brands, develop scalable products and hire teams to bring those products to market effectively. To show the power of the convergence of these forces, I’ve analyzed the employee productivity patterns of the 50+ publicly traded SaaS companies. The chart above shows the headcount growth of the median publicly traded SaaS company from year four through year ten of the company’s life. During those six years, the typical business grows from 184 to 944 employees, adding about 100 each year. During those same six years, the revenue productivity of those employees nearly triples from $78k in revenue per employee per year to more than $200k. The second chart shows the magic of leverage. As a SaaS company matures, the business builds a strong brand which attracts more business, develops internal sales and marketing processes to convince and win new customers, and serves these customers with scalable technology. The multiplicative effect of headcount growth and improving productivity fuels the growth of the business. Consequently, revenue increases from $14M to about $200M. There is some variance, of course, in these figures, as we’ve analyzed in the past. Best in class companies like Salesforce and FinancialEngines are able to achieve more than $300k in revenue per employee per year, but these medians serve as good benchmarks.

Each quarter, Zendesk releases a Customer Satisfaction Benchmark to help companies build more effective customer support teams. The Q4 2014 differs from the previous in an important way. Instead of comparing companies in the same industry, for example, Education, Zendesk clustered companies with similar customer support characteristics, including ticket volumes, product support complexity and a few others, which revealed some important conclusions. Zendesk found four clusters of support organizations listed below in increasing order of sophistication: Late Bloomers - companies of all shapes and sizes whose customer support efforts need improvement. Relationship Builders - small teams which respond slowly, but with personalized and detailed feedback. Relationship builders sustain high customer satisfaction scores because of the personalization. Masters of Complexity - large teams receiving detailed requests with lots of back and forth between the customer and the team. These companies maintain higher customer satisfaction by maintaining a higher ratio of customer service reps to tickets, so each person can take their time and answer a question fully. Captains of Scale - large teams facing high support volumes who use every tool at their disposal and do it well, so they maintain high customer satisfaction scores despite the deluge. The main differentiating factors across these clusters are email volumes, inquiry complexity and response time. The best teams, the Captains of Scale, employ four tools to manage the support volumes and maintain high levels of customer satisfaction: Help Center - enables users to help themselves, which decreases support volumes and increases customer satisfaction because users answer their question immediately. Business Rule Automation - filters support email based on customer value, type of question or some other heuristic. Specialists respond to these questions faster, increasing customer satisfaction. This is particularly useful with very large support voluems. Ticket to Agent Ratio - more agents responding means faster response times, less churn, happier customers. Of course, a startup must balance this ratio with the increased costs. 24x7 Support - very few companies provide 24x7 support because it can be very expensive. But 24x7 support reduces wait times, because agents are constantly responding. Zendesk’s reports are great tools better understand the relative performance of your startup’s support operations. Using the right tools and techniques, you can maximize your customer happiness and increase the likelihood customers refer other customers, helping your startup grow faster and more efficiently .

At Google, Product Reviews were held on Fridays at 130pm in a big room with a long table, two projection screens at one end and red couches along the walls called Marrakesh in Building 42. Each week, Eric, Larry and Sergey invited three product and engineering teams to present their progress each for about 30 minutes. On several occasions, I updated the executive team on the status of our team’s project, social network monetization. Needless to say, especially the first time but really every time, I was nervous about the presentation. I was lucky to work with an amazing team of engineers, marketers and sales people, and I wanted to convey how hard they were all working and how much progress we were making. So I spent a long time putting together the presentation. I worked with a management coach to work on a few things. First, increasing my speaking volume so people would hear and listen easily. Second, eliminating as much as possible ahs and ums and curbing distracting fidgety movements with hands. Third and most importantly, crafting a story to flow through the slides. The last one is always the hardest for me. To help me with this problem, my coach shared with me a tool I use every time I make a presentation called Clearing, Content, Transition. CCT is a simple way to organize, remember and deliver your presentation. Click! A new slide pops up. First, you Clear it. Tell the audience what’s on the slide, so they understand what you’re presenting to them. “This is a chart showing our company’s growth rate over the past year.” This ensures they will stop reading the slide and pay attention to you when you deliver your content. Second, relay the key message of the slide, the Content. This is the one main idea you want to convey from the slide, with a few supporting data points, anecdotes or concepts you would like to share. “In Q1, we grew 50% because we launched a new feature…” Third, and before you advance to the next slide, Transition. The transition is one sentence laying the foundation for the Clearing of the next slide. “We are able to maintain this growth rate because we have the best team…” Click! Now it’s time to clear the team slide. And so on, until the last slide. In the speaker notes of my slide decks, you’ll find Clearing, Content and Transition notes for nearly every slide. I fill them out as I’m outlining the story or after the deck has been created. Knowing these three things about a slide helps me present with confidence. All I need to remember are what’s on the slide, why it’s important, and how I’m getting to the next one. The presentations we gave in Marrakesh improved each time we gave them. I became a bit more confident delivering the updates each time, a bit more familiar with the people and most importantly a bit more comfortable with the material, because I had a consistent framework to deliver the story.

How much should your startup budget for its employee stock option pool? One way of answering this question is a blanket addition per year, say a 2% renewal. Another way is to look at the cash based cost of the stock based compensation. We’re going to examine the second one today by looking at the basket of 50+ SaaS companies. The chart above shows the average stock-based compensation (SBC) per employee by years since founding across the basket of publicly traded SaaS companies. Each blue dot is a data point and the red line is a polynomial regression (loess) to show the trend. In summary, each year the typical public SaaS company spends about $10-20k in stock based compensation per employee. The number is higher when a company is younger and there is a more risk, and employees must be compensated with commensurately more equity. The figure dips when the startup begins to gain momentum, but is before IPO, a period when the appreciation of a grant is more certain. At IPO, typically in year 7, the compensation rises again because option value increases will likely be more muted than before IPO, since the company’s shares are marked to market every day. The SBC investment pattern varies substantially by company. Above, I’ve plotted the median spend on stock-based compensation over the first ten years of each company’s life. NewRelic tops the list at over $25k and ExactTarget is the smallest at below $5k. Many factors skew the investments. Geography (in certain geographies employee value cash over stock), competitiveness of the talent market (more competitive markets create greater stock based incentives), the number of executive hires in a year (executive grants can be quite large, e.g., 8% for a new CEO), and other factors can substantially impact the average spend on SBC. It’s also important to note that the distribution of stock grants is governed by a power law. The founders and executives often hold a substantial fraction of common stock. Because of the skew in the distribution, the average SBC (stock based compensation) figure I’ve depicted above doesn’t necessarily represent the amount given to an average employee. Additionally, the value of the SBC isn’t necessarily an accurate representation of the value of the grant, because in all these cases, options and stock granted in the early years appreciated meaningfully. I’ve plotted the growth in share price by round for nine public companies in this post . In some cases, share prices increased by more than 50x in just a few years. The SBC value reported in a companies financial statements are the 409a valuation data. 409as are independent valuations of company stock that startups perform every 6-12 months, depending on the stage of the company. If you’re curious to probe the depths of stock based compensation accounting, PwC has a great SBC guide here. Managing your startup’s cap table is an important skill. This discipline is increasingly important in competitive job markets for attracting and retaining talent.

Content marketing is one of the most powerful marketing tools startups can employ. Blogs are powerful drivers of awareness and creators of purchasing intent which ultimately lead to new customers, new employees or other new opportunities. This is doubly true as buyers are educating themselves before contacting sales teams to a far greater extent than ever . Below are the five things I wish I would have known when I first started writing this blog. I hope they are useful for anyone designing or redesigning a content marketing strategy. Be Very Clear About Your Goal We are all selling something, whether it’s our ideas, ourselves or our company’s products. For a a SaaS company, a blog’s measure of worth is the rate at which it adds email subscribers to its newsletter. In the world of content marketing, emails are the most direct way of translating page views into revenue. Each email address on that list is a lead for the sales team. The Fastest Way to Grow Traffic is to Post Elsewhere and Link Back Social, email and direct traffic will form the basis for a consistent traffic stream. But the best way to attract large numbers of new readers is to post on other sites with broader traffic bases than yours , and link back. If you don’t bring in new readers, traffic will flatline. The Blog is a Lifecycle Marketing Tool Whatever you may be selling, you should design your content to shepherd potential customers through a buying process: educate customers about a product area, cultivate people into experts, convince them to buy your product, and equip them with the tools to close the sale internally . It’s important to identify your customer segments and publish content for each of the different stages in the buying process frequently. Law of Compounding Returns Like a bank account, a blog demonstrates compounding returns. About half of pageviews to a post on this blog arrive after the day it was first published . So invest in blog posts whose relevance persists through time, which called evergreen content, and watch your audience grow. You Don’t Have Time for This You are only going to give me 48 seconds to read this post , so I better get to the point fast. Write posts in inverted pyramid writing style , which puts the most important points at the top of the article. In 48 seconds, I can’t go very deep on a topic. Cut posts into smaller posts and crosslink posts to create longer pieces.

This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Salesforce went public more than 10 years ago. This harbinger of subscription, internet delivered software created one of the most exciting waves in software and the single most valuable SaaS company today, worth $37B as of this writing. If I had to choose one chart to describe Salesforce, it would be the one above. Salesforce remains the fastest growing SaaS company on record. More impressively than the growth rates are the scale of the numbers. Seven years after founding, the company generated $500M in revenue. No other SaaS company has come close to the same scale of achievement. Salesforce’s S-1 contains the company’s data all the way back to Salesforce’s second year since founding and we can see the revenue growth in the first few years was astounding. In terms of revenue growth rates, Salesforce was maintained a greater than 100% compound annual growth rate until $51M in annual revenue. Salesforce’s averaged an $11k account at IPO across 8000 customers, which is among the bottom third of SaaS companies. SMBs (less than 200 employees) contributed 40% of revenue, mid-market customers (200-500 employees) contributed 30%, and enterprise rounded out the last 30%. To grow this quickly, Salesforce invested a significant amount in Sales & Marketing, but not meaningfully more than the SaaS median. In the company’s earliest years, Salesforce invested about 75-100% of revenues into sales and marketing, a figure that tapers off to the 50%. Salesforce recorded impressive sales efficiency metrics of greater than 1, meaning one dollar of Sales and Marketing investment bought more than 1 dollar of revenue, for years 3 through 7. This amazing sales efficiency fueled the company’s growth and minimized cash burn. And the company reached cash flow break even three years into sales, having burned about $69M. Initially, the company spent very little on engineering. In fact, it was once among the lowest of any SaaS company. But now the company is on a steady path above the median, as the company builds new products to cross sell its enormous customer base, including help desk software, business intelligence and marketing products. Salesforce is a unique business. Out of the gate, the company grew, grew, grew and it’s never looked back. Compared to several newer SaaS companies, Salesforce was remarkably capital efficient. The first pure play SaaS company, Salesforce remains the city upon a hill.

In 2015, SaaS companies trade at a 30% lower multiple of revenue than last year. In early 2014, the typical SaaS company traded at about 9.2x their next-twelve-months of revenue. Since August 2014, that figure has dropped by about 30% to about 6.0x. Almost every public SaaS company has seen multiple compression. Only RealPage, Qualys, NewRelic, ConstantContact and Hortonworks are at highs in 2015 compared to 2014. The other companies in this basket have have all fallen between 1% and 60%+. Xero, which once traded at a 50x multiple (!) is down to 15x (still the highest multiple of all). Today, there are fewer and fewer outliers, companies trading at heady multiples, compared to 2014. The red dots in the chart above mark outliers, companies trading at multiples greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean. In the last few months, all the outliers have disappeared - they now trade within a much narrower band: 5-10x next twelve months’ revenue. As far as I can tell, the compression in the public market hasn’t impacted valuations in early venture rounds. Companies are growing faster than ever, a very enticing attribute for investors and higher growth rates command premium valuations. Given the $50B raised by VCs, this year, half of the dollars raised in 2000 and the second highest amount in those 14 years, there’s plenty of cash to chase exceptional early stage software companies and pay premiums to invest. But I wonder if this slow decline will impact prices in pre-IPO rounds and later stage growth rounds for SaaS companies. Or if perhaps valuations will remain the same but later stage investors will demand more downside protection or guaranteed returns when making investments because they can forecast with much greater certainty the upper and lower bound of a company’s value at IPO. “Structure” as it’s called in industry parlance, has been a feature of several rounds in the most recent SaaS IPOs. The data doesn’t indicate unhealthy multiple acceleration, which would have supported the idea of a bubble. Instead, we’re observing a steady rationalization of multiples, indicating investors have reached at least temporarily a consensus on how fast growing SaaS companies ought to be valued in the public markets. The most immediate impact to startups will be in the terms of growth rounds. I doubt these trends will alter early stage investing dynamics much at all.

Figuring out how much capital your startup may need to raise will inform lots of different strategic decisions. A startup’s growth rate is often highly correlated with the amount of capital it can invest in sales and marketing. More customers means more bookings, which means more capital and so on. The chart above shows the cumulative dollars raised across a basket of more than 50 enterprise software companies. The median company raises $88M before IPO in year six. These companies typically raised $4-6M in their first and second year of existence. Then raised a Series B of about $15-20M, then a Series C of about $20M and finally a growth round of about $40M. Of course, the medians hide the outliers. Some companies like Veeva raised only $4.5M before IPO and others like Box have raised $571M+, so the distribution has some outliers. As the chart above shows, two companies raised only one venture round before IPO and three companies have raised 8. The median company raises 4. Despite the fact that SaaS companies are building some of the most efficient business models ever , newer software companies are raising more capital. Software companies founded in 1998-2001 raised $50M before IPO. On the other hand, companies founded between 2010-2013 have raised three times that amount, at more than $150M. This increase in venture dollars is enabling companies to sustain larger market caps at IPO. Software companies are growing at faster rates than they have in the past, on average needing half the amount of time to reach $50M in revenue because of the availability of large amounts of capital. The capital invested in enterprise startups in megarounds, rounds of greater than $50M, has exploded in the last 5 years from under $250M to greater than $4B in 2014. In 2009, there were 4 megarounds. In 2014, there were 38. Meanwhile, the average size of a megaround has increased from $71M to 113M over the same time period. Megaround frequency and size have both grown substantially over the past five years. It’s precisely this capital that is inflating the total dollars raised figures of newer companies and fueling them to grow faster. Software companies’ fundraising patterns have changed dramatically over the last sixteen years. Though the number of rounds before IPO hasn’t changed materially, round sizes and total dollars invested have ballooned. This cash enables startups to grow faster in the same period of time as their predecessors and increasing their market caps at IPO.

The best teams share two common attributes, according to MIT research : Relatively equal contribution by each member Members with high emotional intelligence. The first characteristic makes sense. A team led by a single dominant person will perform according to the strengths and weaknesses of the (benevolent) dictator. Another team in which the strengths of one member complement the weaknesses of another will certainly be stronger. The second quality, high emotional intelligence, while talked about quite a bit in interviewing training and management training, surprised me. But understanding and anticipating others’ feelings seems to the lubricant to help teams achieve greater performance. Amazingly, emotional intelligence impacts team performance as much when working remotely, by email or Skype , as in person. Interviewing for emotional intelligence can be tricky. After all, how can one reliably measure it in a 45 to 60 minute interview? Well, there’s a test for it. A Harvard research lab has published a 60 second test called “ The Reading of the Eyes ,” that asks respondents to gauge the emotion of a person using only their eyes, and this ability is highly correlated to emotional intelligence. I scored a 30 of 36. My wife, who is much smarter than I am, scored a near perfect 35 of 36. On the whole, women tend to score about 0.5 points more than men. Both of these characteristics share one behavior in common: listening. Equal contribution from team members requires actively listening and considering other points of view. Interpreting feelings is listening of a different kind, less factual, more emotional. The data proves what some have known for a long time: “The reason why we have two ears and only one mouth is so we may listen more and talk less.” ( Epictetus )

SaaS startups are growing faster than ever before. Publicly-traded SaaS companies founded from 2008 through 2014 needed 50% less time to reach $50M than their counterparts founded between 1998 and 2005. I stumbled across this trend when looking at a different chart used in my S-1 analyses that compares the time to $50M for each of the 51 or so publicly traded SaaS companies. I’ve colored the companies founded in the last ten years in red. Newer SaaS companies grow faster. 82% of the companies to achieve $50M in revenue in under 8 years have been founded in the last decade. Meanwhile, all of the companies requiring longer than 8 years were founded before 2004. SaaS companies and enterprise companies broadly are growing faster than ever before. And they are doing it every stage. This chart plots the median revenue of the basket of publicly traded companies by founding date. The curve of every subsequent cohort is steeper and the time to reach certain milestones is shorter. SaaS companies are growing faster at every step in their path. These faster revenue growth rates are the most important contributor to the increasing valuations in the fundraising market . While the increasing supply of venture dollars may enable larger cash requirements for faster growing companies to fuel their growth, the data shows that newer SaaS companies can be far more efficient growth engines than their forbears . SaaS companies are growing faster and more efficiently than ever before. The new sales model of acquiring customers with B2C2B techniques by attracting end users through app stores, self sign up and open source software, combined with high velocity inside sales teams has created an enormously attractive growth engine that will catapult SaaS companies to dominate every existing category of software and many new segments yet to be created.

We’ve seen a sudden decline in SaaS pricing . In the past 3 years, the median Average Revenue by Customer of SaaS companies going public has dropped by about 70%. But has the shift towards smaller customers, shorter and faster sales cycles created less profitable businesses? Not at all. The chart above shows the gross margin trends of public SaaS companies broken down by their ACV (average customer value).   At or close to IPO, the median company, irrespective of price point, operates at about 70% gross margin. But, SaaS companies with ACVs of $50k or less record substantially better gross margins in their early days, 1 to 4 years before IPO, than startups with $100k+ ACVs. Unlike companies offering lower price point products, SaaS companies selling $100k+ contracts often bundle professional services with software to customize the software and train the client’s users how to use it. Most professional services businesses are run at zero or negative gross margin. For example, Workday operated their PS group at Hortonworks operates at -34% gross margin. Workday’s operates at 6% margin. These very low margins depress the business’ overall gross margin substantially, particularly in the early days, when professional services accounts for 50% or more of revenues. Next, let’s look at the true profitability of SaaS companies by ACV. To do that, we’ll examine the cash flow margin (how much of the revenues of the business become true profit). The median SaaS company operates at 7-10% free cash flow at at IPO. But the higher price point companies operate again at substantially lower cash flow margins because of professional services. As all these companies approach IPO, their cash flow margins converge and become statistically indistinguishable. Despite the decline in price points catalyzed by the consumerization of IT, startups are finding ways to develop efficient and profitable companies regardless.

This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. There’s a SaaS company on the other side of the world founded nine years ago that is worth $2B, generates $100M in annual revenue and growing 80% year over year. Based in New Zealand, Xero has built a widely adopted small-to-medium business (SMB) accounting solution that counts 371,000 paying customers, a figure that grew 76% in the last 12 months. Amazingly, 30% of New Zealand GDP is processed by Xero. Xero is an unusual company for two reasons. First, Xero is a glowing example of a successful SMB SaaS company. Second, Xero became a publicly traded company on the New Zealand exchange very, very early on. Consequently, nearly all of the company’s data is public. In fact, below I’ve copied Xero’s P&L from its first year since founding all the way through 2014 - a data set I never thought I would be able to publish on any company for confidentiality reasons. Xero Income Statement 2007 2008 2009 2010 211 2012 2013 2014 Revenue 0.01 0.306 0.6 2.3 7.1 15.8 32.9 61.9 Growth 109% 265% 206% 123% 107% 88% Gross Profit -0.8 -2.0 -2.3 -3.5 -1.6 0.3 21.2 40.6 SG&A. - 0.3 1.2 2.2 3.3 6.2 25.1 58.6 R & D Exp. - - - - - - 9.7 16.0 Net Income -1.0 -3.4 -3.9 -6.0 -5.7 -6.5 -12.1 -30.8 % of Revenue -611% -257% -80% -41% -37% -50% You can read through Xero’s investor materials on their investor portal and sift through their annual report for 2015 here , which reveals that the company acquires SMBs by convincing outsourced accountancies migrate the SMBs these accountancies serve to Xero. And in the US, each accountancy provides about 13 SMB customers to Xero. In the next few charts, we’ll explore Xero’s business and compare it to a basket of publicly traded SaaS companies. Xero operates at the lowest end of the SMB market and its Average Revenue per Customer is second-smallest in this data set at $167 per year. In fact, the ARPC is so small, you can barely see it on the chart. Only WIX, a website builder, has a smaller ARPC. Nevertheless, Xero has built a fast growing business. The company reached $62M in revenue in year 7. It has taken Xero a bit longer to reach these revenue milestones than the typical company. This may be because the business started initially in New Zealand, expanded to Australia, then the US & the UK, unlike the majority of the others in the data set which started in the US, and didn’t face cross-border market expansion until later in their growth. Historically, Xero has spent far less than the median in Sales & Marketing, likely because they achieved high growth rates through dominance of the accountancies in New Zealand and Australia very quickly. Xero expanded into the US in 2011, which is year five in the chart above. Not coincidentally, the company has invested much more aggressively in sales and marketing at and after the US launch to displace Xero’s biggest competitor in the US, Intuit’s Quickbooks. Xero does exhibit an amazing sales efficiency metric of 1.05, meaning $1 invested today in sales and marketing yields $1.05 in gropss profit next year. The median SaaS company charts 0.81 sales efficiency, meaning Xero is at least 50% more efficient. Xero’s efficiency is driven by its customer acquisition strategy, winning accountants and encouraging them to migrate all their business from a competitor to Xero. Winning one accountant generates more than 13 end customers, and generates substantial leverage in the sales model. Xero didn’t break out its engineering spending in its financials until 2013. Of late, the company has been spending about 40% of its revenue on research and development, more than 10 points above the median, to build out its product suite. Most notably, Xero launched a payroll product in the US in early 2015. In dollar terms, Xero’s net income mirrors the median. The company burned about $30M on revenues of $62M. In percentage terms, the story is similar. Xero is right at the median, burning about 10 points more than the median, 48% of revenue, compared to 37 points. Xero is an amazing SMB SaaS business to study because of the company’s ability to develop a monopoly in two smaller markets before expanding to the US, which is rare. It’s much more common to see a US company move abroad. In addition, Xero has employed a unique go-to-market through accountancies that generates enormous efficiencies for its sales and marketing teams. Last, much of Xero’s data from the very earliest days of the company are public, meaning Xero can serve as a great benchmark for other startups. A few quick things to note when examining Xero’s business. The filings are denominated in New Zealand dollars, so be sure to convert to USD. Also, Xero never filed an S-1 because the S-1 is a US exchange requirement and Xero trades in New Zealand, but there are equivalent documents on Xero’s investor site . Last, Xero has a negative gross margin for its early years, which is unusual. This is because they put the majority of their operating expenses in their Cost of Goods Sold. I suspect it might be a regional accounting difference. If there are accountants reading, I’d appreciate your insight.

Christoph Janz , one of the best seed stage SaaS investors, published a great tweetstorm on the state of the SaaS ecosystem yesterday. I’ve copied it below. There’s no excuse for not understanding your metrics, for not providing great customer service, for not understanding the role of customer success, for not doing intelligent lifecycle marketing, for not doing great content marketing…What was hard and innovative 5 years ago is #tablestakes now. The mechanics of SaaS startups are becoming better and better understood as the community and sites like Jason Lemkin’s SaaStr and David Skok’s For Entrepreneurs and Christoph’s own blog curate the stories, explain the complexity and reveal the metrics behind the fastest growing SaaS companies of our time. And as Christoph points out the marketing, sales and customer retention benchmarks have been well analyzed by things like the PacCrest Survey among others. Reading through Christoph’s brief tweetstorm reaffirmed for me how managing complex SaaS startups can be. Founders must understand the unique financial characteristics of SaaS companies, how to market them, how to sell the product, how to retain customers, and all the benchmarks and metrics and execution complexity associated with them. And they must be able to hire the right people to manage those operations as the company grows. There’s lots of data out there, but to be great, one has to read it all, internalize it and leverage it - no mean feat when operating a fast-moving, high-growth company. As the tablestakes for SaaS companies evolves from the discovery of fundamental SaaS startup mechanics to how to erect differentiated and exceptional SaaS companies, the challenges facing founders only increases because the sophistication of the entire ecosystem has increased one notch or two. Thankfully many founders have created businesses solving the SaaS complexity problems for other SaaS companies; Zuora for billing, Gainsight for customer success, Infer for sales prioritization, Looker for Analytics. In so doing, they eliminate complexity for a SaaS company, enabling them to focus on higher leverage areas. And that may be the most important point of all. Today, there is a vibrant, bustling community of people passionate about SaaS, passionate about the next generation models of acquiring and retaining customers and passionate about building the fundamental software companies of the future. If we succeed, it will be because of this wonderful ecosystem of founders and operators, salespeople and marketers, striving every day to make something exceptional - and then telling everyone else how they did it. That’s the engine of Silicon Valley, increasing the table stakes every day.

These are my two favorite devices from 2014. I use each one on a daily basis and both have changed my life in a meaningful way. Amazon Kindle In 2014, I slept really poorly. I had trouble falling asleep and when I did, I had chaotic dreams and I was tired when I woke. I thought it was stress. But it turned out to be my Nexus 7 tablet. Before going to sleep, I read for 45 minutes or so each night. Flipboard, New Yorker, newspapers, emails, and the Kindle App on Android - this was my routine. In December, I bought a Kindle and everything changed. I knew about the impact of electronics late at night on melatonin, the hormone which controls sleep. When humans see blue light, their bodies suppress melatonin, keeping them awake . I had installed f.lux on my Mac, an app which reduces reduce blue light from my laptop through the day. It seemed to make some difference, particularly when I was working late. But the Kindle’s effect on my sleep has been dramatic. I sleep much better, much more deeply, and more consistently. The Kindle has been nothing short of a life-changer. Moto Hint I spend a lot of time on the telephone. Some months it’s more than 60 hours - board meetings, startup pitches, customer and team references, and internal meetings. I had been using the Sennheiser earphones Marco Arment recommended for a few years, and occasionally, a Jawbone Era. Both are bulky in their own way, and I can’t wear either one comfortably for extended periods of time. But, then I tried out the Moto Hint after seeing a review on the Verge (and watching the movie “Her” and wanting to live a bit further into the future). The best thing about the Hint is the size. It’s so small and so lightweight that it’s easy to forget it’s in my ear even after a few hours on the phone, which is a novel feeling. The sound quality is pretty good, the noise cancellation is great, and the fact that the case charges the Hint while in my pocket means it’s always ready to go. I don’t really use any of the advanced features. The size is the killer feature for me. The Kindle and the Hint are my two favorite devices from 2014. What are yours? Tell me on Twitter .

After writing about B2C2B companies last week , I received a lot of great comments about the differences between the B2C2B models, particularly  the sales models after a company has acquired the initial Consumers. These are three sales models I’ve observed B2C2B companies use to convert the initial momentum with consumers into dollars. The first sales model is the 2 Phase Sell. LinkedIn and Duolingo employ this. LinkedIn attracts large number of consumers with a place to find jobs and post resumes.  Then LinkedIn sells recruiters (and others) access to this data. The B2C2B sales movement involves using the consumer data to create a valuable data asset which is sold to someone else. Duolingo is a free language learning mobile application that asks language learners to translate sentences. These sentences are actually provided to Duolingo by big internet sites, who pay Duolingo to translate their pages into other languages , through the work of these language learners. The second sales model is the Up Sell. Employed by Expensify, Yammer, Slack, Tableau and many others, the Up Sell model attracts employees to use the product because it’s easier to use or improves their productivity in a meaningful way. The social proof of all these employees already using these products informs and fuels a sales process to convert a larger fraction of the company to convert to paid. The third sales model is the cross-sell model, which is often used by companies B2D2B companies - those who target developers as their advocates. Companies like Heroku, Pantheon, Parse and others attract developers to use their products because these platforms eliminate complexity and decrease time to deployment of the product. Developers employ these platforms to create products that often serve the needs of the marketing and product or other internal teams. Developers make the selection and often another team within the company foots the bill. These models are simplifications of the way B2C2B companies generate revenue, but I think they’re useful frameworks for planning a startup’s go-to-market.

Since LinkedIn’s IPO in 2012, the company has grown its market cap by 6x and as of this writing is worth about $27.5B. Second to Salesforce, LinkedIn is the second largest SaaS company in the world. Unlike most SaaS companies which are B2B, LinkedIn is a B2C2B company . LinkedIn attracts hundreds of millions of consumers to post resumes online and sells this data and access to its audience to advertisers and recruiters and salespeople.  The intrinsic data and people network effects of the business create reinforcing feedback cycles that have helped the business achieve tremendous revenue growth. By every measure, LinkedIn is a remarkable business. It’s one of only two SaaS companies to break the $500M in annual revenue mark and has done it with an incredible growth trajectory, tripling that number is two years, as the chart above shows. This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Unlike most SaaS companies who offer a single product, LinkedIn offers three: Talent Solutions, Premium Subscriptions and Marketing Tools. Recruiters buy Talent Solutions to find, connect with and acquire talented people. Salespeople buy Premium Subscriptions to network and search on the platform. And many different types of businesses buy ads to market their products to LinkedIn’s audience. In 2007, the Premium Subscriptions generated 53% of the revenue. Seven years later, the SaaS part of the business, the Talent Solutions part of the business brings and 56% of the revenue and has been the fastest growing part of the business. This, more than any of the data point, is why LinkedIn is a B2C2B. As the amount of profiles on the platform has grown, so has the company’s ability to monetize that data in software. Limiting ourselves to only the Talent Solutions part of the business, we can evaluate the  Average Revenue Per Customer over the same seven-year period. In 2008, the average recruiting team spent about $20,000 per year with LinkedIn, a figure that has reached $35,000 in 2013, achieving a growth rate of 16% per year. Meanwhile, the number of paying customers has grown from 900 to about 25,000 in that time. To acquire customers, LinkedIn employs two customer acquisition mechanisms: an online acquisition team and a field sales team. In 2007, online sales generated 63% of revenue. Over the past seven years, the field sales organization has flipped that figure and now represents close to 60% of new business. The field sales teams are probably responsible for the increase in customer value, pursuing larger customers and closing larger teams if not entire recruiting departments. This data suggests that at the beginning, LinkedIn grew primarily through self sign up and other online mechanisms, but over time has come to complement that with a terrifically successful sales team. It serves as a great model for how B2C2B companies can complement their bottoms up strategy with a sales team . Because of the combined online and field sales acquisition channels, and because the company serves both enterprise customers and prosumer types, LinkedIn is able to achieve best in class sales efficiency. It’s a bit of an unfair comparison, considering how much of the business is self sign up, but it stands is an amazing figure. Even more impressive, LinkedIn spent significantly less than the median publicly SaaS company in terms of sales and marketing, which both includes online acquisition and field sales efforts. LinkedIn’s gross margin is 87%, more than 10 percentage points above the median. This is likely because LinkedIn’s infrastructure costs and customer support costs are slower than the typical SaaS company. However, LinkedIn does spend more on research and development than the median company (26% vs 18%).  LinkedIn has huge amounts of data but more importantly, they must solve some very complex graph problems, for example, search across the social network by degrees of separation, which are very computationally complex.  in addition, it’s clear that the company is broadening their product portfolio in order to build to sell more products like Sales Navigator , to increase the average revenue per customer over time. As for net income, LinkedIn operates at break even, which makes the company’s growth that much more remarkable compared to some SaaS companies which are operating at -70%+ net income to revenue. It’s is a testament to the efficiency of the business LinkedIn has built LinkedIn is an amazing company and the biggest B2C2B company on the planet. The sales efficiencies and the breadth of revenue streams it has created are best-in-class and they are a terrific role model for B2C2B startups.

This week, an entrepreneur told me his startup is a B2C2B business. It was the first time I’d heard this acronym, and I thought it was a genius moniker. B2C2B (business-to-consumer-to-business) succinctly captures the critical part of the new customer acquisition model powering many enterprise startups: winning hearts and minds of the intermediate consumer, the employees of a company. B2C2B models are behind much of the innovation in every part of the enterprise stack, from applications to platforms to infrastructure. In the application tier, companies like Expensify and Tact use mobile app distribution to acquire end users (the C) in large enough quantities to eventually convert a team, division or an entire enterprise into a paying customer (the B). In the platform tier, Heroku and Pantheon market first to developers as end users (the C), who prefer to use dramatically simplified development environments, to win them over as loyal users and proponents. Then, Heroku and Pantheon sell through these developers into the enterprises they work for, eventually closing larger enterprise license agreements. In the infrastructure tier, Redhat , Cloudera and MapR build momentum and distribution in the open source community to attract developers to use and deploy the software. Again, they sell through these developers to close enterprise contracts. The power of the B2C2B model hinges on the influence of the C in a sales process. If a startup can convince either a large number of employees in a company to use a product, or if they can convince a few of the right people that this is the right product for them, that startup benefits in two ways. First, the startup knows precisely which of their potential customers are primed to buy. Second, the startup’s sales team has a powerful social proof argument to drive the sale through. Both of these advantanges result in faster sales processes with higher close rates, enabling a business to grow more efficiently. It’s about time this bottoms-up sales model were more broadly recognized for the disruptive force that it is . In addition to all the financial success many of these companies enjoy, perhaps the B2C2B acronym will further spread the gospel of influence driven marketing and sales in every part of the enterprise stack.

What percentage of SaaS IPOs in the last four years have the founding CEOs of the business been CEO at the time of IPO? 62.5%. In about two thirds of SaaS IPOs from 2011-2014, the founding CEO is the current CEO. Is there a meaningful difference between the equity stake of a founder who is CEO at IPO, and a founder who is no longer CEO? About 1.1 percentage points. Founder/CEOs retain 15.5% of the company, while founders/ex-CEOs retain 14.4%. The original equity allocation among founders, ongoing employment at the company and the dilutive impact of venture capital are far bigger determinants of equity at IPO than current role. The chart above shows the broad spread of equity holdings by CEOs immediately before the IPO, as reported in each company’s S-1. They vary from 5% to 53%, an amazing range. In what fraction of cases does the founding CEO remain at the company? Of the cases I surveyed, all but one of the founding CEOs remained with the business. They typically became Chief Product Officer, Chief Technology Officer or Chairman of the Board. – I’m happy to see that more than the majority of founders of these public companies have remained at the helm of their companies through IPO and beyond. I’m also thrilled that the dilutive impact to founders who hire someone else to lead their company is minimal. And the data shows both founder and non-founder CEOs can lead to huge outcomes (LinkedIn and Workday are the two most salient examples.) As the data attests and as Reid Hoffman wrote in his post If, Why and How Founders Should Hire “Professional” CEOs ,
“Both approaches can work, which means that as an entrepreneur, you should focus less on what’s fashionable, and more on what’s right for you.”

One of the most important forces in SaaS today is the Consumerization of IT. Instead of a centralized IT organization deciding which products to buy, product managers and marketers and engineers and data scientists determine which products they think would serve them best and buy them directly, often using a credit card. This movement is transformative and its impact is immediate. The chart above plots the median Average Revenue per Customer by Year of IPO for the 50 SaaS companies that have gone public in the past five years. The typical SaaS company going public in the last three years has a 77% smaller average revenue per customer than companies in 2010 – 2011. In the past four years, two companies went public with average revenue per customer of less than $1000 (RNG, WIX); and another four went public with less than $10,000 typical customer sizes (ZEN, HUBS, FLTX, NEWR). In contrast, 2011 companies logged a median customer value of $96,000. When these newer cohorts of companies have gone public, they have roughly four times the number of customers paying one-fourth the price of their older brothers. Consumerization of IT is an incredibly powerful trend for SaaS startups for three reasons. First, it exhorts startups to build better products which are easy to use and provide immediate value . Second, this trend demands the the sales process evolve from an education sale to an execution sale, from a push to a pull sales process , where customer support and success meaningfully reduce cost of customer acquisition . Buyers educate themselves with online materials and through product trials (perhaps some contact with support) before ever contacting the sales team, contrary to the traditional enterprise sales process where outbound sales dominates. Third, consumerization of IT enables SaaS startups to acquire customers far more cost-effectively than in the past , which means they need less capital to grow just as big. The Consumerization of IT trend isn’t going to reverse.  Buyers prefer buying this way - it provides them more control and less financial exposure. There are no longer locked into large, companywide contracts with particular vendors. In addition,  startups benefit by reducing their capital needs and creating faster, more repeatable sales processes, that often look more like B2C sales than B2B. The impact is dramatic and startups have no incentive to reverse course. Over the last three years, consumerization of IT has made an enormous impact on SaaS startups. The first three IPO classes of companies benefiting from this trend have demonstrated billion dollar companies can be built using these techniques. And I’m certain over the next few years, we will see many, many more building businesses on larger numbers of smaller customers.

Each year, I do a retrospective analysis of this blog. This year, I found something unexpected. Like many other content sites, just a handful of posts on this blog generate the majority of the traffic. I’ve plotted the distribution of traffic by post above; it’s clearly governed by a power law . The top 2% of posts generated 19% of traffic, the top 10% account for 48% and the top 20% attracted 69% ( Pareto would be vindicated ). None of that data is surprising. However, the source of traffic for the exceptionally successful posts is unexpected. The chart above shows the share of traffic generated by each channel. Twitter and Facebook which dominate the social channels generate 40% of traffic in aggregate. Direct, people typing in tomtunguz.com, generates about 35%, and so on. This data naturally led me to the conclusion that social is critical for generating exceptionally successful posts. This aggregate analysis works in the case of normal or Gaussian distributions, but it breaks down when the data is governed by a power law. Let’s break down posts by quartile and look at traffic source for each of them. Social consistently generates about 40% of traffic across all the quartiles. Direct traffic is also relatively constant as a share of traffic across all posts. However, referring sites expands from about 5% in the 25th and 50th quartiles, but explodes to 25% of total traffic for the best performing posts. In retrospect, this makes sense. Highly trafficked sites send lots of referral traffic. When a blog post resonates with the readers of that site, some of them come to explore this blog more deeply. The data illustrates why content syndication and collaboration with other sites is so important for content marketing - a useful end of the year insight. Over the past year on this blog, Twitter followers have tripled, traffic has tripled and email subscribers have more than quadrupled. In short, everything is up to and to the right.  I want to thank everybody for the inspiration, advice, feedback, suggestions and support over the past year. On to 2015!

Thanks to Bill Macaitis , current CMO at Slack and former CMO of Zendesk, who inspired and co-authored this post When discussing customer success for SaaS startups, the conversation focuses mostly on retaining customers and reducing churn. These are two fantastic benefits with meaningful return-on-investment. But great customer success organizations can meaningfully impact another critical part of the customer lifecycle, customer acquisition, by catalyzing evangelists to refer new customers. Let’s examine a hypothetical SaaS company that acquires 1,000 customers though sales and marketing. Assume a standard 15 month payback period implying a CAC of $1250 per customer or $1.5M in aggregate. Each customer pays $1k annually to use the product. If customer success can convert 1 in 10 of those customers to evangelists, each of whom refers only one other customer that year, the company’s CAC drops by a third. Impact on Growth by Customer Success for Hypothetical SaaS Company Acquired Customers 1000 1000 1000 1000 % Evangelists 0% 10% 20% 30% Referrals per Evangelist 5 5 5 5 Effective CAC 1250 833 625 500 MRR, $k 83 125 167 208 MRR Sales Efficiency* 1 1.5 2 2.5 I’ve modeled four different scenarios above and varied the fraction of the customer base that the customer success team converts to evangelists. According to SATMetrix, the company behind the Net Promoter Score , typical B2B companies have about 10-20% NPS on average, so I’ve used those figures as the base case. The best-in-class companies achieve 60 NPS scores. Let’s examine the third scenario in a bit more detail. 20% of customers become evangelists and each refer 5 customers. The effective cost to acquire a customer falls by more than 50%, the monthly recurring revenue (MRR) increases by 100%, and the MRR sales efficiency also doubles. In short, the impact of a great customer success team on every major SaaS metric can be dramatic. This growth effect compounds over time if the customer success team can continue to find and cultivate evangelists. The swelling ranks of promoters will become an increasingly meaningful and cost-effective growth engine for the business. While the math works out very neatly, the challenge with this idea lies in accounting for referral properly. There are no water-tight mechanisms for attributing the source of a particular customer. Some companies ask evangelists to use links or codes to track referrals. Customer signup surveys asking new customers how they heard about the product is another effective mechanism. But these mechanisms won’t capture the entirety of referrals. Additionally, the rewards from such an effort may take a while to materialize. As a result, patience is important when building and managing a CS team.

Are startups growing much faster than they have in the past? The chart above plots the time required for startups to raise rounds at $1B or greater valuation, over the past ten years. The blue line is a logarithmic regression demonstrating the decrease from about 7.5 years to less than 2.5 years. The answer seems to be an unequivocal yes. Let’s break this chart down by type of company: B2B and B2C. B2B companies have taken longer to reach this valuation milestones. 10 years for Docusign. 5 for Pure Storage. But only 3 years for HortonWorks. B2C companies grow much faster than B2B companies and the data proves the trend. Social networks in particular, see faster and faster rates of adoption: Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, Pinterest, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat have reached the $1B mark faster than the other, almost in lock step with their year of founding. Why is this happening? I think there are at least four causes. First and most importantly, sample bias. We haven’t yet allowed enough years for the companies founded in 2011 that require five years to reach a billion dollar value to mature, which depresses the average value. The startup founded in 2010 that takes 7 years to reach the $1B mark hasn’t yet been granted enough time to achieve it. In addition, some companies never reach the billion dollar valuation mark in the private markets, preferring to go public beforehand. ZenDesk and New Relic are two recent examples. But for the companies on this list, distribution platforms enable companies to scale much more quickly than ever before. iOS and Google Play address billions of users. A hit application or social network that captures the minds of users can achieve much faster growth rates than their web-based predecessors, and address the 10x greater population of mobile phone users compared to PC users. Enterprise platforms like Salesforce’s Force.com gave rise to Veeva, a company that raised only $4M before going public seven years after founding, now worth billions. Third, users are much more receptive to trying new technologies than ever before. Consumers trust mobile commerce. Enterprises pursue technology innovations and adopt them at earlier phases of product development, to gain a competitive advantage. Many of the biggest banks in the world have staffed technology business development teams to scout and source breakthrough technologies. In addition, open source software is a big driver of infrastructure innovation. Open source provides transparency and prevents lock-in to proprietary standards for large companies. More importantly, open source is a powerful distribution mechanism. Look no further than the containerization movement pioneered by Docker and now CoreOS, whose growth is enabled by Open Source, to prove the point. Last, the capital to finance immense growth is readily available. Startups are raising rounds that would only have been possible in the public markets five to ten years earlier.  The median IPO in the late 90s was about $25-30M. Today, that’s a big Series A. In the current environment, a large growth round can top $250M. 2014 will likely be the third largest year for VC fund raising since 2000, meaning investors have more capital to invest than in quite a while. In the meantime, the number of billion dollar startups has increased, but not quickly enough  to keep pace with the increase in capital. This supply demand imbalance is also leading to an increase in startup prices, further decreasing the time to $1 billion in valuation. Some startups are growing faster than ever before. These breakout companies’ market value increases dramatically through their lifecycle and they are empowered to grow faster and faster by new distribution platforms and a capital market that is hungry to fuel their growth.

Are you a Barry, Jill, Buzz, Angel or a Devil? This is the question Best Buy store managers posed each time a potential customer walked into one of its stores when the company decided to segment its customer base in 2005 . Barrys are high-income family men. Jills are soccer moms. Buzzes are gadget lovers. Angels are the best, most-profitable, customers and buy new products at full price. Devils, on the other hand, erode Best Buys’ profits because they use coupons, find the best deals and return products frequently. After launching this segmentation, restructuring its stores to meet the needs of these segments, and focusing on the profitable segments, Best Buy’s revenue increased 8% , an impressive figure for a retailer. As your startup scales, customer segmentation can become an important tool for the entire company, just like it was for Best Buy. Personas anchor product design and development, marketing and sales, and even customer success to tangible user archetypes. Personas define the company’s strategy of which customers to pursue and which not to. Best Buy’s segmentation unites two classic segmentation types, needs-based and profitability based segmentation. The Jills, Barrys and Buzzes in the Best Buy example are need-based segments. The canonical enterprise segmentation of Small Business, Mid-Market, and Enterprise used by many SaaS startups fits this pattern. But there is another important customer taxonomy: segmentation by profitability. Angels and Devils are profit-based divisions for Best Buy. More common in industries with little growth, profitability segmentation can be a powerful tool to help startups focus on the right customers to grow more profitably. Profitability segments are first-pass filters. They answer the question, which customers should I be acquiring? Which are the most profitable for the business? While they may be less attractive, unprofitable customers need not be be shunned; Best Buy didn’t turn away the Devils. Instead, Best Buy crafted pricing mechanisms to convert Devils into profitable customers by charging a restocking fee and upselling much higher margin products such as extended product warranties. The same idea holds for SaaS products. For the lowest price customers, prioritizing sales leads, tiering customer support, charging for customer success may radically change the business’ cost to serve and unit profitability. Lemons become lemonade. The second-pass filter, needs-based segments, divide the most profitable user segments into personas for the go-to-market teams. They identify the company’s core customer, define personas, and enable the business focus on these customers’ needs first. Developing the right segments is critical. Wikipedia has a great list on the criteria for determining whether a segment is a useful one : is segment measurable, addressable, stable and consistent? But the most basic is the first. Is there enough data? Segmentation is a powerful tool to be employed by startups once the customer base becomes large enough, which probably means at least a few hundred customers. At that point, the business will have enough data to divide the customer base into meaningful slices. Then, it’s time to analyze the data, affirm the conclusions with user research and then employ the segments in product development, sales and marketing. One more bit of advice on segments: choose your personas’ names wisely. A moniker like Devil doesn’t endear the customer to your business.

Yesterday, SAP announced it would acquire Concur for $8.3B, the single largest SaaS acquisition in history in dollar terms. To put this acquisition in context, I looked at six other public-to-public acquisitions, where one publicly traded company acquired another. Because the acquired target is public, much of their financial information is readily available. As the chart above shows, the Enterprise Value/Trailing 12 Month Revenue (EV/TTM Rev) multiple SAP paid for Concur is tied for the highest among any public-to-public SaaS acquisitions. Transaction Price ($M) TTM Rev ($M) Growth Rate Gross Margin Year of Acquisition Enterprise Value EV/TTM Rev SAP/Concur 8300 546 32% 63% 2014 5988 11.0 Oracle/Eloqua 957 95.8 34% 72% 2012 864 9.0 Oracle/Taleo 1921 315 33% 67% 2012 1805 5.7 IBM/Kenexa 1397 333 25% 61% 2012 1332 4.0 SAP/Ariba 4607 517 27% 66% 2012 4390 8.5 Oracle/Responsys 1770 194 25% 53% 2013 1291 6.7 SAP/SuccessFactors 3764 328 59% 66% 2011 3599 11.0 Above, I’ve copied a table that compares the key data points across acquisitions. Across these seven transactions, Concur generated the most revenue. Concur’s gross margins of 63% are a bit below the median of 66% and their growth rate equals the median. It’s easier to explain SuccessFactor’s premium multiple because they recorded a 59% annual growth rate when they were acquired in 2011. But can we explain the pricing of these MegaExits for the rest of the sample? Below, I’ve plotted two charts showing the relationship between a company’s growth rate and the TEV/TTM Rev Ratio at acquisition, and the gross margin and the TEV/TTM Rev Ratio. In both cases, the R^2, the measure of how strongly the variables are correlated are pretty weak. I tried to create a simple linear to model to predict the TEV/TTM Rev Multiple yields using these two variables in addition to revenue. But the model has no predictive power. In other words, across this very small sample set, the financial fundamentals of the business don’t really drive the multiples. Instead, factors like brand, management team, strategic importance and competitive auction dynamics seem to be much more influential over the ultimate selling price than income statement and balance sheet. Each of these massive acquisitions is a huge strategic move for the acquiring company and therefore, it’s viewed as a snowflake, a one-of-a-kind-acquisition. I’m certain we will quite a bit more fireworks in the SaaS M&A market. I’m curious to see how acquirer’s thinking around purchase prices continues to evolve. But in almost every regard, Concur’s sale to SAP is an exceptional event for the SaaS world.

Crisis in startups is inevitable. Products break, deadlines are missed, legal issues arise, customers raise issue, employees quit, bad press circulates. To survive, founders and management teams have to respond well and quickly. In Managing the Unexpected, two University of Michigan Professors examine the characteristics and behaviors of great teams during crisis. Factory workers, miners, fire fighters, aircraft carrier flight deck hands, railroad operators and many others. The authors call these teams HROs for High Reliability Organizations. HROs are distinguished by an ability to handle novel, risky situations. HROs combine distinct values and a certain type of leadership. At their core, all of these teams embody mindfulness, means five things: Preoccupation with failure - a burning desire to learn from mistakes to prevent future ones. Reluctance to simplify interpretations - employing brutal intellectual honesty in their cultures. Sensitivity to crisis - being ready to identify and respond to a crisis. Commitment to resilience - building a team that is excited to handle and bounce back from crisis. Deference to expertise - respect insights about the business from “experts” within the irrespective of their seniority or lack thereof. These are great values for startups to inculcate in their cultures and hiring processes. Startup company building means rapid product and business experimentation. Moving that fast means the team is bound to break things. The company must be built to absorb, react, recover and learn. One of my favorite anecdotes from the book is this one about Churchill: During World War II Churchill made the horrifying discovery that Singapore was far less impregnable than he thought and was actually highly vulnerable to a Japanese land invasion. Reflecting on this unexpected discovery, Churchill commented in his history tory of the war, “I ought to have known. My advisors ought to have known and I ought to have been told, and I ought to have asked.”' Mindfulness means anticipating crisis, opening up the channels of communication from every part of the company to gather expertise, understanding the causes of the crisis in all their complexity, committing to resolving the crisis, and learning from it.

This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Box is a 1000+ person company providing collaboration and document sharing software. We had previously analyzed the business when the company filed their first S-1. Yesterday, the company filed an updated version of their S-1. In the past two quarters, some of the key financial characteristics trajectory have improved materially. In the next seven or so charts, we’ll explore how the Box business has evolved. We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I’ve used New Relic’s colors as a consistent legend. Box company data is powder blue, median values are black, and other company values are gray. While the company took a little longer to hit its stride than most, Box is growing revenues incredibly quickly.  In the last months, the company will have grown more than 111%, and astounding figure for company generating more than $120M in revenue. The median publicly traded SaaS company achieves those growth rates at $13M in revenue and is unable to sustain them past $35M in trailing twelve months revenue. This extraordinary growth is readily apparent in this chart. In year six, Box was relatively close to the median four total revenue that in the last 12 to 18 months, the company has clearly pulled away and demonstrated exceptional revenue growth. File sharing products are viral. When one user adopts Box to share files, eventually many other users within a company will want to share files similarly to collaborate. This behavior engenders best-in-class account revenue expansion. Box reported greater than 30% annual account growth for each of the previous three years. To compare, I’ve plotted New Relic’s account growth by year.  Box been able to sustain greater than 30% negative net churn figure , while New Relic’s has been declining each year at about 9%. In short, this behavior is a massive and incredibly valuable engine of revenue growth for the business. Box took six years to reach $50M in revenue and is among great company including Hubspot, Demandware, Splunk and ServiceNow. But as we’ve seen in the previous charts, Box’s initial ramp was slower, followed by meteoric revenue growth. In order to achieve this growth, Box has invested a huge amount of capital. In fact, the business has outspent almost every other company to achieve their revenue. However, in the last year, the business has reduced its investment and decreased their burn rate. When the company filed their first S-1, the company reported net income as a percent of revenue at -191%. This figure has dropped by 30% to -136% in the last year, to about $168M. To achieve this cost reduction, Box reduced its investment in sales and marketing by 19%, from 169% of revenue to about 138% of revenue. At this pace, the company is still far above the norm. The tradeoff is that the company is also growing at 10x the rate of the median. As a result of a decrease in sales and marketing investment, Box’s sales efficiency , a measure of how much revenue a dollar in sales and marketing yields, has doubled from 0.27 to 0.54, which is about 36% less than the median. This is a good sign for the business, especially when considering the average account expansion pattern noted above. In addition to relative sales and marketing expense reductions, the business reduced its investment in engineering, as a percentage of revenue from 50%+ to 37% in the last twelve months. While this figure is substantially above companies of a similar age, it’s consistent with companies in their fifth year, who on average are growing as quickly as Box. Box’s gross margins are 10 percentage points better than the median, at 79% and continue to rise as the company grows. Higher gross margins enable the company to invest more in customer acquisition and point to a business with increasing efficiencies . The average customer pays Box about $5000 per year. Given the number of free accounts, this measure is likely a bit misleading. The largest customer has more than 95,000 seats and is likely worth more than $1M, but unfortunately, we don’t have a distribution of customer account size or other proxy to get a better sense. Overall, Box has dramatically changed its investment strategy in sales & marketing and engineering investment, likely through a decrease in hiring, to reveal a very special business underneath. The company has best-in-class negative net churn, improving sales efficiency and exceptional revenue growth. Some may still point to much higher than median losses, but this objection will likely disappear with time. The company is proving an ability to cut costs by 30%, improve efficiency 50%, and still grow revenue 111% annually.

Growth is king in today’s public markets. Most of the SaaS IPOs we’ve analyzed have traded growth for profitability and they have been rewarded handsomely for it. For the large tech companies, this trend is no different. The public market prizes growth. Some public tech companies sustain growth through internal efforts, but many use their cash reserves to acquire fast-growing startups. These public market cash reserves total $430B or so across the top 250 or so public tech companies, a massive war chest that will fuel startup M&A in 2015. Let’s break down this cash by sector: as the chart above shows, B2B software and Consumer Hardware companies each posses about $100B. Semiconductor, Infrastructure and Consumer Web companies’ cash reserves total more than $65B each. In short, there’s a lot of capital available across sectors. I
Not surprisingly, this capital isn’t evenly distributed. In fact, cash follows a power law. The top 25% of tech companies by market cap control $276B or 66% of all the cash. These companies have market caps of $17.1B+. The next quartile of companies, those with market caps of greater than $7.4B and less than $17.1B control $154B or about 36%. The smallest companies in the data set control about $22B. I Public companies use cash for many different things including share buybacks, investments in their own businesses, insurance, working capital and so on. But the sheer scale of cash on the balance sheets of IT companies, and the huge pressures from the public market for growth, indicates that there should be plenty of startup M&A activity across many sectors in 2015.

In which sectors have software companies created the most financial value? I asked myself this question over the weekend. I categorized the top 250 IT companies which spans $675B in market cap (AAPL) to $3B in market cap (ASOS) and created the chart above. B2B Software, which includes Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and SAP among others represents about 30% of the total IT market cap today. The consumer web (GOOG, FB, Baidu, eBay) is second at 20% of market cap. Semiconductors and Consumer Hardware (led by Apple), tie at 17% each. Most of these very valuable companies are older than I thought. Below, I’ve plotted the year of founding of each of these 250 companies. 13% of the top 250 IT companies today were founded before 1950. On the other hand, companies founded since 2000 account for 19% of the stock tickers but only 10% of the market cap. In other words, these younger, newer companies are smaller on average. Aside from being a great decade for music and fashion , the 1980s saw the founding of today’s largest IT companies with a median of $9.3B in market cap across 24 companies including AAPL, ORCL, MSFT, SAP and EMC. Over the next ten years, I suspect we’ll see the next generation of B2B Software companies rise to the same levels of market caps as these big names. The opportunity to replace these companies’ aging technologies is simply massive. Let’s break these trends down by sector as a proxy for innovation rate. Not surprisingly, the most valuable Consumer Web companies have all been founded after the invention and widespread adoption of the internet. B2B Software is also witnessing rapid innovation with big companies built in the last 10-20 years, which supports the idea that we’ll see some huge SaaS businesses in the future. In contrast, Financial Services hasn’t seen a new $3B+ company created in a while, indicating there’s likely quite a bit of opportunity here. LendingClub’s pending IPO will change this to a certain degree. B2B Software will remain the biggest category by market cap for a long time implying there are huge opportunities there for new SaaS startups to disrupt.

When will the tech bull market end? It’s a question that I’m asked with some frequency. There are three fundamental reasons for the bull market. First, technology is changing nearly every part of the economy. Consequently, there are many huge opportunities for entrepreneurs to seize. Our internal analysis shows that only 2% of IT budgets are spent on cloud today. Second, the capital startups require to pursue those opportunities is plentiful. 2014 will be the third largest year in VC fundraising since 2000. Third, the exit market is vibrant and rewards market leaders with massive outcomes. In other words, there is a lot of strength in the fundamentals of the tech ecosystem. But aren’t startup valuations at crazy levels? Price is a function of supply and demand. Prices for startup shares have increased dramatically over the past few years as the dollars raised by VCs has doubled year over year, while the amount of great companies founded each year has not. As long as there is more demand than supply, and investors can generate “reasonable” returns, prices will be sustained or will increase. Looking at 9 of the IPOs in 2014 , investors in nearly every stage of every company will generate a positive return. What would cause a change in the environment? The biggest risk is the public market changes the way it values companies. The financing markets are a train and the IPO market and M&A markets are the locomotive, setting pricing multiples and valuations. If the public markets decide a tech startup is worth materially less than private market investors thought, then lots of investment is underwater, and prices correct. For example, in January 2014, the public markets priced SaaS companies at 8x forward revenue. Three months later, that figure fell to about 5x . The outlook of those 40 publicly traded SaaS companies had’t improved or worsened during that time, but this basket of companies was worth 33% less than a quarter before because large investors rotated from growth stocks to value stocks. If these exit markets slow down, so will every other car in the train (Series A, B, etc), because sustained multiples reduction of that scale impacts the return profile for every investor from seed through growth. Alternatively, current publicly traded companies could consistently miss their revenue and earnings targets, indicating weakness in the economy or limited market size. This weakness would cascade into the private markets and push valuation lower. But that isn’t happening. In Q3, 70% of the publicly traded VC-backed tech companies I surveyed exceeded expectations, meanining these companies have a good degree of predictibility of their businesses. At some point, the tech bull market will change. But at the moment, founders are building impressively large, disruptive companies. VCs, flush with cash, are financing startups at the fastest pace in 14 years. When these startups reach scale, the IPO and M&A markets welcome these businesses. Public market investors seek returns unattainable elsewhere, and acquirers buy the growth necessary to stay on top of their industries. It’s a great time to be a founder.

2014 has been a great year for SaaS companies. By my count, 9 of them will have gone public. Meanwhile, SaaS companies in both the public and private markets continue to fetch premium valuations. To illustrate the rapid appreciation in the value of these SaaS companies, I’ve plotted the share price by round of each business. The color bars in the chart represent Series A, B… through to IPO. The last bar, called Q414, is yesterday’s share price (if the company has already IPO’ed). A few interesting trends emerge from the data: First, the two last IPOs, New Relic and Hortonworks both have priced their IPO at below their last round price. On paper, the investors participating in the Series F of New Relic and the Series D of Hortonworks seem to be underwater. Second, once these SaaS companies trade in the public markets, they pop. The median appreciation in share price from IPO to today is 52%. The average is 95%. In other words, the shares of these companies are worth 50-100% more than at IPO. I’ve plotted the median share price by round below: If the same patterns hold true for New Relic and Hortonworks, then the last investors in those businesses should see positive returns from their investments. I wonder if Hortonworks will see the same pop given the gross margins (35%) are substantially below SaaS norms of 65-70%, but we’ll know very soon. Third, the average SaaS IPO in 2014 raised 4 rounds of capital. Two companies, Tableau and Veeva, raised only 2. On the other side of the spectrum, New Relic and Workday raised 6. The 2014 Class of SaaS IPOs show there are many different ways of building a business. New Relic and Zendesk are pure product-driven sales companies. Workday and Hortonworks deliver their products with large amounts of professional services revenue. Veeva and Tableau have demonstrated exceptional capital efficiency. If this data is any indication, and of course setting aside the survivorship bias of this type of analysis, SaaS should remain a very compelling place for founders to build companies and for investors to invest.

I’ve been reading a book called Legacy Of Ashes, which is an exhaustive history of the CIA since its founding more than 50 years ago through to 2007. Reading spy stories is always enthralling, but surprisingly, the book is a fascinating case study in management. The major theme of the book is the value of intellectual honesty, a principle which was often forgotten according to the research compiled by the author. In case after case, from the Korean War to the Bay of Pigs invasion to the second Gulf War, there were consistent organizational failures to present candid assessments of data and a consistent pattern of deception to further political motives. In contrast, Dominic Orr, the CEO of Aruba Networks, describes his management philosophy of brutal intellectual honesty in this 4 minute Stanford video. I’m paraphrasing a bit here, but this is the kernel of wisdom from the video: Brutal intellectual honesty. There are too many decisions to make in too little time. You want to get all the facts on the table, have an honest debate for a period of time, and at the end of the time, make a decision and go. Once ego becomes involved, people have to find a way to save face, which is incredibly time wasting. And if you recall, time is the only competitive resource we have. According to Dominic, to elicit intellectual honesty from a management team demands coaching and counseling team members individually, so each person is comfortable enough in their environment and confident enough in their own opinions to speak their mind freely. Only then can a team determine the best route to pursue. This is not an easy task, but all great teams have this working relationship. It’s something we all should aspire to achieve.

What are the pains and aspirations of your customer? Does your product truly solve your customers problems? And fulfill its promise of doing something in a better way? Most startups wrestle with these questions at their outset, when they are in the customer discovery and customer validation phases of the lean startup cycle. But all startups should reevaluate these questions periodically. After all, a company’s customers evolve with time and so do their jobs. The product-market fit assumptions that held true six months or year ago or three years ago may no longer be valid. It can be challenging to succinctly communicate a startup’s value proposition even to people who are intimately familiar with a company or sector. In this sequel to Business Model Generation called Value Proposition Design , Alex Osterwalder and his team have published a value proposition diagram that solves the problem of articulating the match between customers needs and a startups product. The diagram, reproduced above, identifies the three key parts of serving the customer well: the details of the customer’s current task, the pains of accomplishing this duty, and the aspirations of the customer of what could be done better. These three areas form the basis of customer discovery. For a startup to attain product-market-fit, the startup’s value proposition should neatly map to these needs. First, the product must accomplish the majority of the customer’s job. Second, the product should eliminate the customer’s pain. Last, the product has to enable the customer to do more than they could they could before. It might sound basic, but these core ideas can get lost in the fray of rapid iteration of a product, particularly during the early phases of lean startup development, when a team generates a huge number of ideas. Or the neat product-market-fit may erode over time as the customer and the ecosystem mature. Whatever stage a company may be in, the business needs a mechanism to communicate how the product solves the needs of the customer to each team:  product, marketing, engineering, and sales. This ensures that sales pitches, product development and positioning all point in the same direction: the right one to solve the customer’s problems and build a successful company.

After your SaaS startup has found product market fit, the next evolution of the business is to discover the fundamental unit of SaaS growth. A fundamental unit is the atomic go-to-market team: the minimum number of people in the marketing, sales and support roles to be able to support X customers and generate Y in revenue. At the point that a startup has discovered their fundamental unit, time, cash and execution become the limiting factors of the business. Most of the other risks in a company’s path have been mitigated . In other words, it’s time to raise a growth round to scale the business. The key members of a fundamental unit are depicted above. These are the questions when determining the composition of a fundamental unit: How many marketing team members and how much marketing spend are required to create enough leads to feed a Sales Development Rep (SDR) who tees up meetings for an Account Executive (AE) to close? Once the AE has closed the customer, how many Customer Success (CS) managers are required to keep customers happy and how many Upsell reps must be staffed to generate negative churn ? Each startup’s fundamental unit will vary in its particular ratios. Below are the ranges I’ve seen for these ratios, but keep in mind, there’s lots of variability for different types of businesses (SMB vs Enterprise, Word of Mouth vs Outbound customer acquisition, etc): Marketing : quite variable; it depends on the main customer acquisition channels of the business. SDR to AE : varies from 1:1 to 1:3, depending on lead volume and lead qualification rates CSM per Customer: one industry rule of thumb is 1 CSM per every $1-2M of ACV. But this figure varies. Companies with smaller Average Revenue per Customer and less developed products will need to staff larger ratios of CSMs. Upsell Executives per AE: this figure varies by company revenue size from about 1:8 to 1:3 according to data from the 2014 PacCrest survey Once a company has figured out the math, namely the ratios of people in each role and total spend, the business must transition into hiring, onboarding and managing as many fundamental units as quickly as possible. And at this point, the company knows precisely the revenue contribution and cost of each team. In other words, just add cash to grow.

It’s hard to overstate how powerful negative churn is for a SaaS company. Both New Relic and Zendesk have grown to billion-dollar-plus publicly traded businesses by achieving fantastic negative churn figures: 114% and 120% respectively. in other words, each year existing customers pay these businesses 14 and 20% more than last year. The recent 2014 SaaS benchmark survey aggregated by Pacific Crest and Matrix indicates that expansion revenue accounts for between 8-26% of total annual bookings, increasing as the company scales. There are many different ways of achieving this kind of account expansion.  In some cases, customers use more of a product over time and consequently increase their spend without help from a salesperson. In other cases, startups rely on upsell teams to entice and encourage customers to increase their spend. Often, these upselling teams operate within the customer success organizations, structured as parallel sales organizations with quotas similar to the new customer sales team. In these types of sales teams, how much should a startup spend on customer account expansion? Using data from the PacCrest survey, I estimated the relative investment between new customer salespeople and upsells salespeople. At the very earliest stages of a company, startups effectively staff five to seven salespeople to acquire new customers for every one salesperson hired to increase account size. In practical terms, the smallest companies likely don’t have a full-time person, but divide the time of a smaller sales team. As the company grows in size and revenue, this proportion decreases to about 2.5 new customer sales people to 1 account expansion salesperson. The PacCrest survey presents some terrific data to support an investment in both customer success and a parallel upselling team. At scale, these teams contribute upwards of 25% of annual bookings.

At the DEMO conference, Danielle Morrill, the founder and CEO of Mattermark presented an impressive statistic. Seed, Series A, Series B and Later Stage startups employ 1M people, up from 650,000 just six months ago, according to Mattermark’s data sources. While it’s logical to think that the largest and fastest growing startups might employ the majority of startup employees because they hire at stupendous rates, this isn’t the case today. Impressively, Pre Series A company employment has boomed, increasing by more than 2x in the past six months. These seed-stage companies employ 450k. Mattermark’s employment statistics proxy the startup formation rate. The fertile fund-raising environment and the accelerating rates of new technology adoption have been enticing a substantial number of potential founders to take the leap of faith required to start a business. The doubling of employees in Pre Series A companies presages  a boom in Series A financings over in the next 12-18 months and some of those companies founded today will become the behemoths of tomorrow. It also foreshadows a wave of innovation of new and wonderful soon-to-be-released products. Importantly, investors have raised nearly twice as much capital in 2014 as in 2013 and their coffers are well stocked  to finance new and fast-growing companies. There’s a world of potential right around the corner, and it’s plain to see looking at employment and fundraising data. 2015 will be an exciting year for Startupland.

Hortonworks filed their S-1 last week. Reading through the document, I noticed the company had quite a substantial fraction of professional services revenue; 41% of trailing 12 month revenue is services. Of the companies we have studied in our S-1 analyses , Hortonworks generates more professional services revenue as a fraction of total revenue than any other company. But, many companies do book a meaningful amount of revenue from professional services. The chart above shows Veeva, Workday, Responses and MobileIron each generate 20% or more of their revenues from professional services (PS). Typically, professional services revenue isn’t valued very highly because there’s no leverage in this model. To increase revenues, a PS-heavy company must hire people to perform the work, so revenue is a function of hiring pace. Consequently, these companies trade at smaller multiples than pure software companies. For example, Accenture, one of the world’s largest consulting companies, trades at 1.6x revenues. Contrast this multiple to a basket of the fastest growing SaaS companies which trade at 12x. The difference in valuation afforded to companies which grow revenues by leveraging technology rather than growing headcount can be 10x! Some regard professional services as a necessary part of service large enterprises. The chart above proves the point. Compare the percent of revenue derived from professional services to the average revenue per customer (shown here in Log10 in thousands of dollars, so 1 = $10K, 2 = $100k, etc.), and the relationship between the two becomes clear. In fact, the correlation is very strong at 0.72 R^2. In other words, the larger the average price for a piece of software, the greater the likelihood of business will derive meaningful revenue from professional services. This isn’t a surprise. Larger customers, who pay substantially more for software, have much more complex environments. In order for new software to flourish within an enterprise, the software most likely will have to be integrated into existing systems. This integration work constitutes the vast majority of professional services work. In addition, large numbers of customer staff must be trained to use the product, which also falls into the professional services bucket. Professional services isn’t a terrible thing for a business. Workday, which generates a third of its revenue from PS, trades at 25x revenue. The professional services fees, though, are heavily weighted to initial integrations and should dissipate over the course of a customer’s lifetime. So, in 10 years time, the vast majority of Workday’s revenue should come from software. Companies that rely on ongoing PS to create value for their customers, like Accenture, won’t be afforded the same multiples. There are many ways to build a massively successful SaaS company. Some companies, like New Relic, Zendesk, and Tableau do this purely through software. Others like Veeva, Workday and Responsys combine software with professional services. The larger the customer account, the more likely professional services will be a significant fraction of a company’s revenue. The key for founder is to ensure that at some point, professional services fees per customer declines with time and the company can leverage technology to retain to expand its revenue.

Negative churn is an incredibly attractive characteristic of a SaaS company because it means that customer accounts are like high-yield savings accounts. Every month, more money comes in, without much effort. This is a powerful effect and can fuel SaaS companies to huge success, as we saw in New Relic’s S-1 . The concept of negative churn is a bit amorphous so let’s illustrate the impact on a startup. The chart above plots the revenue growth of a hypothetical SaaS company for a year. This startup acquires 100 customers per month, each paying $1 per month to use the product. And the company loses 5% of those customers each month, so only about half of the January cohort remains in December. Contrast this with a company which has achieved 5% negative churn. In other words, the company still loses 5% of its customer base each month, but the remaining 95% of the customers grow their spend with the startup by 10 percentage points, so the total revenue from the cohort is equal to 105% of the revenue from the previous month. Like a savings account, each month, every cohort becomes more valuable. 5% Monthly Churn -5% Monthly Churn Total Revenue in December 919 1592 Mean Cohort Revenue in December 77 133 In the 5% monthly churn case, the startup exits 2014 with $919 in MRR (monthly recurring revenue) and the typical customer is worth $77. In the negative churn case, the startup’s revenue is 73% larger at $1592 and the average customer is worth $133. In both cases, the business has the same number of customers. But in the negative churn case, the startup has been able to grow their accounts. Not all businesses can grow their accounts this way. But many companies do. The main modes of account growth I’ve seen are: Seat expansion: sell the product to more people within the company and charge by the seat (ex. Salesforce, Expensify) Resource expansion: entice the customer to store more data or use more of your service (ex. New Relic, Twilio, Heroku) Cross-sell: sell adjacent products that increases the value of the core product (ex. AWS S3, EMR, etc) But I suspect there are other categories, too. And of course, in many cases, the customer success team is responsible for this type of expansion. There are some important nuances to negative churn as Ferenc points out in his post on the topic . Namely, negative churn is an average and for most companies, customers’ revenue follows a power law distribution (the old 80/20 rule where 20% of customers generate 80% of revenues). So one customer can create negative churn if that customer’s spending increases dramatically. Meanwhile, the company may hemorrhaging the majority of its customer base. Looking only at revenue churn wouldn’t reveal the potential cataclysm. This is why it’s important to pay attention to both revenue and account churn. Combined with annual prepay contracts, negative churn is a very powerful growth mechanism. When thinking through your pricing model and your customer success strategy, it’s worth trying to engineer negative churn into your startup.

This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. New Relic is San Francisco based, 534 person company providing tools for engineers to understand how well their code is performing. The company operates in the Application Performance Management category, which New Relic calls Software Analytics. Engineers insert code into their applications which sends data to New Relic’s servers. New Relic processes this data and provides interactive reports to identify underperforming code. New Relic charges by the server - the more computers monitored, the greater the subscription fee. Today, the company counts 250,000 users and 10,590 paying customers. An interesting sidenote: the name New Relic is an anagram of the founder’s name, Lew Cirne. In the next seven charts, we’ll explore how New Relic built their business. We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I’ve used New Relic’s colors as a consistent legend. New Relic company data is teal, median values are black, and other company values are gray. All the data come from New Relic’s S-1. If I were to use only one chart to summarize why New Relic has built an amazing business it’s the following one which shows the annual revenue growth rates of New Relic customer accounts. Each year, the typical customer pays New Relic 14% more than last year. In industry parlance, this is called negative revenue churn. Negative churn an incredibly attractive attribute of a business because it means if the company were to cease spending money to acquire new customers, the business would still grow at a 14% CAGR. New Relic achieves negative revenue churn because customers instrument increasing numbers of servers over time, which costs more. The longer a customer uses New Relic, the more they become accustomed to developing with all the product’s insights, the more servers and applications they will migrate to New Relic’s analytics system. So despite relatively flat new account acquisition numbers which have remained at about 750 per quarter, New Relic’s revenue will continue to expand because of the negative churn characteristic. As the S-1 indicates, in addition to the smaller accounts that likely form the majority of the company’s customer base today, New Relic is pursuing larger customers. At the time of the S-1, the company recorded an Average Revenue per Customer of about $8k. This will surely increase as the company penetrates engineering teams more deeply and the investments in sales and marketing begin to reward the company with larger contracts. But this account size easily supports building an inside sales team to scale revenue quickly. Another aside: the majority of New Relic customers pay on a monthly basis, unlike most SaaS companies which move to pre-pay annual contracts. Many SaaS companies move to annual pre-pay to be able to finance their own growth more efficiently and to reduce churn. But churn doesn’t seem to be a concern for New Relic. Storing data for their customers provides the business some lock-in. The combination of negative churn, account growth and pursuit of larger accounts has enabled New Relic to grow rapidly. The company reported $63M in trailing twelve months’ of revenue in their 2014 fiscal year which is right at the median. Impressively, New Relic increased revenue 213% y/y. New Relic’s sales efficiency has historically been higher than the median at 1.4, but recently that figure fell to 0.98 as the company tripled its spending on sales and marketing from $10.7M to $28.4M. The S-1 indicates the company is expanding rapidly in EMEA and APAC, in addition to the US, all of which requires marketing spend and building sales teams. Here’s another impressive chart. New Relic’s gross margin has hovered at 83%, an amazing 25% better than the SaaS median. And this gross margin has been constant for at least the past 3 years. Gross margin is revenue minus cost of goods sold. In this case, New Relic’s main costs are storage and customer support/success. The incredible consistency of the gross margin might indicate the company actually manages pricing to this metric. New Relic burns more capital as a percentage of revenue than the median publicly traded SaaS company. Over the last three years, the business has operated at -68% net income-to-revenue ratio, twice as high as the 35% median for comparable companies. This substantially higher relative burn rate is driven by massive investment in sales and marketing. In years 4 and 5 of the company’s life, New Relic has invested  twice as much on a percentage basis in sales and marketing (92% of revenue) than the median company (48% of revenue). Meanwhile, New Relic is on par with its peer-set for engineering investment, at about 26% of revenue. This implies New Relic has been hiring sales people at an incredible clip. The business added 224 people in the past 12 months, and presumably the majority of those have joined the go-to-market teams. New Relic has built an amazing company, one with some stunning negative revenue churn characteristics which should set the high-water mark for public SaaS companies.

At the beginning, a startup is only people, a group of friends who share a passion to change the world in some way. There is no product, no brand, no management team, no PR, no swag, no internal processes, no hierarchy. Over time, by virtue of all the effort of the people within the company, startups evolve into semi-autonomous machines; machines that acquire and serve customers with a great product in exchange for revenue. Once the machine is operational, most of the conversations about the company shift from the people building the business to the machine they have assembled. While understanding the machine is important, the personal stories of the individuals architecting and operating the machines fascinate me much more. Unlike most startup histories which focus on the machine, In Startupland , Mikkel Svane, the founder and CEO of Zendesk, chronicles the creation of one of the most efficient business machines ever by concentrating on the human stories. Throughout the book, Mikkel shares his perspectives on the softer parts of business - not how to build a great customer acquisition engine - but how his team’s perspective on the company changed with time: Our goal was to build not a big company, but a great product…But soon the honeymoon ends. The idea becomes a reality, and you discover that even though you never really wanted to build a company, all of a sudden you are doing just that. And the reality is that building a company is hard—it’s no longer about just pursuing an idea. The idea has taken off, and it becomes all about executing and scaling…Before you know it, you have all these real customers who need real attention, and you need to start building the beginnings of an organization. Startupland is one of the most genuine and candid articulations of the human side of startups. He writes about the dynamics of the founding team (Alexander and Morten) through the challenge of financing the business in its early days (who to trust?), the strain of relocating the company not once, but twice (with families in tow), and his personal trials as he evolves into the CEO of a publicly traded company (particularly when firing people). Every founder should read it.

The modern SaaS startup asks marketing to fill the top of the funnel, sales to qualify and close leads, and customer success to retain customers. Conceptually, this trinity works in unison to grow a business rapidly. But sometimes, SaaS companies struggle with this model, particularly when churn rates increase in a business. The knee-jerk response may be to ask how to change the customer success team’s structure or incentives to increase the revenue at risk save rate (the fraction of dollars that might have churned, if not for the efforts of the customer success team). But the churn problem may be the symptom of improper pre-qualification up-stream in the sales and marketing workflows. Imagine a very effective sales team that is able to sell freezers to eskimos. In other words, the sales team closes all kinds of customers, both who truly benefit from the product and those who may not. As sales velocity increases and revenue balloons, churn rates rise in tandem. Pretty soon, many of the prequalified customers cancel their subscription, churn rates expand and the customer success team struggles to meet their target save rate, despite working furiously to manage the flood of poorly qualified customers. Further investigation may reveal the sales team is selling ahead of the product and engineering team’s ability to release features. For example, this could be because the product team is behind schedule. In order to decode the churn puzzle, the leaders of each of these four teams (product, marketing, sales and customer success) must collaborate on defining the right goals for each team and balancing the needs of each. The marketing team commits to generate a certain number of leads to feed the sales team who signs up for quota depending on the product team’s ability to deliver features on time. Meanwhile, the customer success team rallies to save a certain fraction of revenue. All of these goals are in tension and are interconnected. If the customer success team isn’t represented by a peer in the management team, customer retention challenges triggered by events upstream may not be surfaced in time to avoid large increases in churn rates. As the chart above shows, when churn rates rise, a startup begins to burn much more capital to maintain the same revenue, so this is an important problem. For a hypothetical SaaS company, the difference in cash needs between a 4% monthly churn and a negative 4% monthly churn is close to 90% less capital. (Negative net churn occurs when the revenue from existing customer base grows fast enough to offset the loss of churned customers.) While putting off hiring a leader of customer success may seem like a reasonable business decision, for fast-growing SaaS companies, the investment will pay off handsomely in the form of a well aligned team, properly structured goals across the organization and substantially better capital efficiency of the business.

Most interviews are a waste of time. According to Adam Grant, a professor of Organizational Behavior at Wharton , “standard interviews only accounted for 8% of the differences in performance and productivity.” The typical interview fails to predict performance accurately because it is subject to interviewer biases and candidate biases, and fails to compare the candidates with a consistent rubric. In a talent market as competitive as today’s, startups who can more accurately assess candidates’ future performance will create a tremendous recruiting efficiency and ultimately execution advantage. Though no interview system will predict future performance flawlessly, structured interviews, work tests, and intelligence tests are three times more predictive than unstructured interviews. A structured interview process consists of three things: first, the characteristics of the ideal candidate are established at the outset; second, a team creates the questions used to establish whether a candidate embodies those characteristics ahead of the process; three, the interviewing team scores each candidate on a numerical score. When I interviewed PMs at Google, we used a very structured interview process. These are the core features of Google’s process at the time: The Google PM team selected four essential attributes for new PMs: technical ability, communication skills, intellect, and Googliness/conscientiousness. A group of experts, in this case, long time PMs, create a library of situational judgement questions that represent typical situations a PM at Google might face 1 . These are shared across the PM team. The interview committee tasked each interviewer to screen for all four, but focus on two of the key attributes in particular. The specific two attributes were indicated in an email before the interview. Interviewers score each candidate on a 1-5 scale. The interview feedback is aggregated by the hiring committee, filtered by score and then discusses each candidate above the threshold in greater detail. Periodically, interviewers were trained on identifying and mitigating their own interview biases. Every company will develop its own hiring practices. But the research on employing structured interviews with situational judgement questions is a compelling argument to reconsider the traditional unstructured interview. In addition, asking candidates to prepare a work product is an incredibly important part of the process. Work products are typically presentations or white-boarding sessions tackling a key strategic issue for the business. A 90 day plan for a team or department for example. IQ tests are not new, but they are less common in technology than in other places. Many use GPA or educational background as a proxy for intelligence, but those are lossy predictors. As your startup evaluates its interviewing process, consider adding some of these components to increase hiring success. 1 There are many ways to implement Situational Judgement Questions. Research shows they can be delivered online or asked as a multiple choice quiz, with the same predictive power as in person, which means they can be very effective tools for high volume screening.

Seed investments are booming. According to Crunchbase data, the number of seed rounds in US companies has grown by 10x in 6 years from 200 per year to more than 2,200 in 2013. This is driven by the expansion of the institutional seed investor and the tripling of seed stage capital available to founders. With all that capital entering the market, seed round sizes have also increased. The top quartile seed rounds have expanded by 44% in 8 years, and by 75% since 2008. The 75% percentile seed round in 2014 totals $1.3M.  Coincidentally, this seed round size maximizes a seed stage’s company odds of a follow-on Series A . The expansion in seed investments spans the top 3 states for venture capital (CA, MA, and NY), which collectively account for 70% of seed investment dollars raised. Today, Californian seed-stage startups raise 8.2x as much in aggregate as they did in 2008. Massachusetts startups have increased their seed investment by 20x and NYC companies have raised more than 14x more seed dollars. Capital is plentiful. Startup infrastructure costs continue to plummet App stores and other novel channels of distribution are flourishing. At this point, a startup’s most challenging task, aside from finding the right idea, is recruiting and retaining a great team. But if you needed another push to found a startup, just take a look at the data.

Most startups play defense when discussing pricing with customers. They dance between asking for too little, leaving money on the table, and asking for too much, only to lose the customer’s interest. The very best companies lead their customers in that dance. They use pricing as an offensive tool to reinforce their product’s value and underscore the company’s core marketing message. For many founding teams, pricing is one of the most difficult and complex decisions for the business. Startups operate in newer markets where pricing standards haven’t been set. In addition, these new markets evolve very quickly, and consequently, so must pricing. But throughout this turmoil, startups must adopt a process to craft a good pricing strategy, and re-evaluate prices periodically, but at least once per year. These are the seven factors I believe founders should consider when pricing when they go to market: The Basis for Pricing: There are three ways to justify a pricing plan. Value-based pricing charges customers a fraction of the incremental value created by the product or a fraction of the costs saved by the product. This is often seen in ad tech or any type of optimization technology. A startup increases conversions by 50% and they take 10% of the gain as their fee. Value based pricing is also employed in slightly less rigorous ways. Salesforce sells CRM seats based on an aggregate ROI of increased sales productivity for example. So does Expensify, which decreases the time to file expenses. With cost-based pricing, startups mark up the product they sell by some margin. Many infrastructure as a service companies do this. AWS, Twilio, Heroku, etc. It’s very common in commodity or nearly-commodity industries, where customers know the prices of the components used to provide the service. Third, competition based pricing works well in markets where the price and value of a particular type of product are well established. Startups adopt the pricing model well known in the industry. Positioning: Positioning is the most frequently forgotten of the 4 Ps in Marketing. Salesforce exemplifies exceptional positioning .  Used strategically, pricing can be a weapon, a source of competitive advantage in the market. Your company can employ pricing to communicate to the market whether your product is a premium, mid-market or low cost alternative. Startups can choose to price below the market, to gain share and grow quickly (Zendesk, AirWatch); they can choose to price at the market price and differentiate based on product features (Dropbox and Box) ; or they can charge a premium for their product, which reinforces their positioning as the gold-standard in the sector (Palantir and Workday). To be effective, a startup’s pricing strategy must align with its marketing case studies, website messaging, PR releases and sales pitches. If all the arrows point in the same direction, then pricing becomes an asset to reinforce the company’s position in the market. Customer Base Size: The number of total potential customers multiplied by the selling price of the product equals the total addressable market (TAM) for a startup. Generally speaking, bigger TAMs are better. If there are a small number of relevant customers, as in Veeva’s case where the entire market is about 200 pharmaceutical companies, the average revenue per customer must be very high. At IPO, Veeva’s average customer paid the company about $750k per year. On the other hand, if there are millions of potential customers, as in Expensify’s case, the average revenue per company can be much smaller and still justify a billion-dollar-plus TAM. Sales Team Structure: Pricing impacts the structure of a sales team and their day to day performance for two reasons. Higher price points decrease sales velocity, the number of deals closed per sales rep per unit time, and increase sales volatility, the chances a deal closes. Inside sales teams selling $5-30K products can sustain a deal velocity of 3-8 transactions per month, depending on quota. This keeps morale high and creates a very predictable revenue forecast. No individual customer signing or balking will materially alter the company’s ability to achieve plan. On the other hand, higher price points require more skilled, more expensive salespeople. Called field sales or outside sales people, their compensation starts at about $250k per year for on-target earnings (OTE - combination of salary and sales commission). Outside sales teams chase larger accounts, and may close 1-3 per year. But if all of them go sideways, the company’s revenues for the year will suffer materially. Contract Length: Many SaaS startups launch with monthly pricing which encourages customers to try the product and engenders demand. At some point, most SaaS startups switch to annual contracts for three reasons . First, revenue becomes much more predictable. Second, annual contracts often include terms that require pre-payment up-front which rewards the startup with lots of cash to grow faster. Third, contracts mitigate churn rates because the customer is only making a renewal decision once per year, instead of 12x per year. Employing contracts can materially improve a startup’s cash position, unit economics and predictability. Your Startup’s Unit Economics: Your pricing plan has to enable the company to become profitable at some point. The value of your business is the discounted sum of all its future profits. Adopting a lower price point may increase sales velocity, create lots of demand, and keep sales teams happy, but if the price point doesn’t generate enough gross margin to achieve reasonably quick payback periods, and the business suffers from an increase in churn, the company is in trouble. Just a quick reminder: Payback Period = Cost of Customer Acquisition/Gross Margin The gross margin is the revenue per customer minus the costs to provide the service. A decrease in price reduces gross margin and will consequently increase payback period. Margin Structure of the Customer Base: Compared to software companies, grocery stores are terrible customers because grocery stores have single digit margins. The margin structure of your startup’s customers matters a great deal when setting pricing. All of your product’s cost must be paid from your customers margin. The more margin your customer has, the more they can pay you for your product. Like product development, developing pricing is a never-ending exercise. A startup’s environment, its product and its positioning change with time, and price must evolve in tandem. The best way for a startup to ensure its price is reasonably optimal to create a framework for evaluating price and revisit the data a few  times per year. This is one framework. If you have others, or additions, email me. I’d love to hear them. To end this conversation on pricing, I’ll quote Lawrence Steinmetz who wrote a book on sales called How to Sell at Margins Higher Than Your Competitors: “The first thing you have to understand is the selling price is a function of your ability to sell and nothing else. What’s the difference between an $8,000 Rolex and a $40 Seiko watch? The Seiko is a better time piece. It’s far more accurate. The difference is your ability to sell.” Sales, marketing, product and pricing, when aligned, create powerful branding and margin-expansion effects.

The median equity stake of US venture-backed post-Series A CEO has increased from 15% to 21%, a 40% increase in five years. This trend is also manifested in Series Bs, but as the chart above shows, post-Series C and D, total founder/CEO equity positions have remained constant. Meanwhile the equity stakes of founding VP of Engineering and VP of Product have remained relatively constant throughout the same five year period across all stages of company. Founder stakes start high and then typically decrease over time as founding teams sell equity stakes in their company in exchange for venture capital investment and also granting shares to hire candidates and retain existing employees. As valuations have increased in Series A companies , founders may be able to sell less of their company in order to raise the same amount of money. Of course, investors do tend to have ownership thresholds, which constrains this trend to some extent. But valuation expansion isn’t the most important trend driving this rise in founder-CEO equity stakes. If it were, VPE and VPP equity stakes would also see a relative rise over time, because each of the three is a founder and the reduction in dilution would benefit each proportionately. Instead, I suspect the data is showing a rise in the number of single founder companies, because CEO stakes are increasing but the equity positions of VPP and VPE haven’t risen in tandem. Aside from valuation, the major determinant of a founder/CEO’s equity stake is the number of founders in the company. The fewer the number of founders, the greater the equity stakes for each founder. There is some subset of companies within the data which only have a founding CEO. Another cohort has a founding CEO and VPE. Another group has a founding CEO, VPE, VPP and so on. All those cohorts are mixed in the chart and the data I use doesn’t specify the number of founders within the company. I don’t know of any data, anecdotal or quantitative, that shows success rate is correlated to number of founders, and I wouldn’t believe such an argument. Redpoint has invested in companies with a solo founders, a duo of founders and a trio founders. We’ve seen success with all these types of founding teams. Rather, this increase in single-founder startups is likely a by-product of the growth in entrepreneurship in the US. Individuals, enamored with an idea, take it upon themselves to start a company to create the change they wish to see in the world. And that’s a very good thing.

What a difference a few quarters make! In the past nine months, Series A valuations have skyrocketed. In fact, 2014 Series A pre-money valuations have surpassed median Series B valuations from 10 years ago, accounting for inflation. The same is true for Series B valuations exceeding Series C valuations. Cooley, a top tier startup law firm, reported this trend in their valuation quarterly report , which tracks these figures where they are counsel to either investors or founders. The chart above illustrates Series A pre-money valuations in red. The grey line smooths the chart to show long term changes and the blue dashed line marks the 2004 Median Series B pre-money. In Q2 2014, the median Series A transaction reported by Cooley exceeded the 10 year Series B valuation. In fact, Series A prices have simply taken off, nearly doubling in six months. This is the same chart for Series B valuations. Pre-money valuations have increased in Series Bs as well, although to a lesser degree than Series As. Series B valuations have also exceeded their ten year Series C prices, but the rise has been more gradual than in Series As. The Series A valuation explosion is probably fueled by the tripling of capital in the institutional seed market. As young startups raise larger seed rounds, they are able to progress further, develop more momentum and increase their valuations before raising the next round of capital, the Series A. As for the question, why now? It may be that the first wave of big-seed-round-startups, who raised in 2012 and 2013 are maturing 12 to 18 months later. This valuation increase hasn’t manifested itself in Crunchbase data, yet .  There are a few possible reasons for this. First, Cooley’s data focuses on a tiny sliver of startups and this sample may have a very strong skew to the most valuable companies. Second, Crunchbase reports the round size, but not valuations.  Perhaps investment size is remaining constant but valuations have increased and investors are satisfied with less ownership. Third, Crunchbase data may be delayed because some of the Cooley transactions haven’t been announced yet. Nevertheless, I’ll be paying attention to the Series A market, because if the trend continues, and the Series A replaces the B, we can finally state with confidence that the Series Seed is new Series A, which would imply a very substantial change in industry dynamics. Institutional seed funds will have become the new de-facto Series A investor. NB: If you’re a founder, I recommend reading Cooley’s report which reveals the standard terms found in today’s term sheets. This data should help you understand what to negotiate for when raising capital.

It’s Q3 earnings season and about half of the major public tech companies and recent startup IPOs have reported their figures. I keep track of earnings to get a sense for how these companies perceive their markets. Meeting or exceeding earnings indicates companies can forecast their growth and demonstrates how predictable these businesses are. The more predictable, the more stable the business environment and consequently, the fund raising environment for startups. The chart above shows the revenue surprise figures for the companies who have reported earnings so far. Revenue surprise is the percent difference of actual revenue per share figures compared to the estimated ones prepared by analysts. 69% of these tech publics exceeded forecasts in Q3 which compares to 60% in Q2 . Similar to last quarter, consumer companies constitute the majority of the revenue misses: Amazon, Angie’s List, eBay, GreenDot, Google, Trulia, Xoom. In fact, the median consumer company equaled revenue estimates, whereas enterprise companies surpassed them by 2%. But the difference is likely insignificant. Now to profits. 65% of these companies exceeded earnings. Interestingly, the enterprise company beat EPS estimates by 7%, compared to consumer companies who again matched estimates. Overall, high growth tech companies seem to be operating in very stable and predictable environments, a great sign for the tech and startup fundraising markets.

The real promise of the Internet of Things isn’t simply linking millions of devices together, just like the real innovation of the web wasn’t networking a bunch of computers. Instead, the true and still unrealized potential of IoT is to transform business models; it’s enabling companies to sell products in entirely new and better ways that benefit both the company and the customer. Around the turn of the millennium, startups began using the web browser to deliver their products to consumers and companies. Soon afterwards, instead of paying a one-time fixed price to use the software, customers subscribed to access the software. You can’t buy Quicken or Quickbooks on a CD for one fixed payment anymore. Now it’s a subscription. Though the difference may seem slight, this evolution of business model has several immense and crucial advantages that apply both to Internet businesses and the Internet of Things. First, companies can forecast their revenues much more accurately because customers commit to paying for a specified period of time. Second, management teams can plan with greater precision, hence they are emboldened to sustain higher growth rates, increasing the value of their business. Third, subscription companies often require less capital to grow because many customers pay up-front for 12 months’ worth of service, which provides the company negative working capital . Effectively, the company borrows money from its customers at less than zero interest to finance its growth. In short, subscription business models empower tremendous growth with terrific capital efficiency. Similar to the Internet, IoT enables offline companies to evolve their business models from transactional revenue to subscription revenue. That’s why it’s such a big deal. The Internet of Things has the potential to alter the way companies spend trillions of dollars. GE, which has positioned itself as a leader in this transition, aims to convert its airplane turbine business from selling aircraft engines at a fixed cost with maintenance fees, to selling hours of flight time. In other words, instead of buying one engine and a service contract, a major airline would buy 100,000 flight hours from GE with a guaranteed level of engine uptime. GE benefits for the three reasons outlined above. Airlines benefit by winning greater predictability, fewer delays, and consequently greater profitability. To enable this transformation, GE must instrument their turbines with sensors, relay the data from the sensors to GE data centers, process this data, predict when engines will fail and service them before-hand. They call this new business model the Industrial Internet . Clearly, the Industrial Internet concept applies to almost every part of the offline world, from copy machines to MRI scanners, from gas pipelines to off-shore drilling rigs. Like the potential of the internet, the promise of the Internet of Things will take a while to materialize. To ask a huge multinational to transform their business model on-the-fly isn’t easy. Of course, startups pursuing opportunities in the Industrial Internet will accelerate this pace of change. But we’re talking about changing the way the biggest industries do business. Patience is a requirement. Nevertheless, IoT isn’t a buzzword. It’s not a passing trend, a fad, or a transient meme. IoT is a fundamental reinvention of the way the largest industries do business which makes it one of the best business opportunities of the next decade.

At some point, most startups will begin to measure their customers’ happiness. Customer satisfaction is an important predictor of loyalty and can foster  fantastically efficient word-of-mouth growth. Many companies employ Net Promoter Score to quantify customer satisfaction. NPS measures the fraction of a customer base which are promoters and detractors of a company’s product. I’ve been told that NPS scores greater than 50 are impressive, but this is simply a rule of thumb. So what’s the right way to evaluate a company’s NPS report? Zendesk recently published NPS benchmarks that are quite useful to interpret NPS scores. These are the four most interesting data points I found in the report: Median NPS Score by Type of Company B2C 32 B2B 29 Internal 49 First, the mean NPS across the 230 companies is 29. But this average varies across customer types. The table above shows B2B customers are less satisfied and loyal than B2C customers. Internal customers, for example, employees served by internal IT teams, are the happiest of all. These averages support the rule of thumb, that a score of 50 is terrific. (To calculate an NPS score, subtract the 26% detractors from the 55% promoters, yielding a 29 NPS.) Second, customer NPS responses follow a bimodal distribution. As you can see in the chart above, users tend to respond very positively (9 or 10) or very negatively (0). 65% of the responses fit into these three buckets. Additionally, I was surprised to learn that middle-of-the-road scores indicate customers are highly likely to be detractors. Third, the data confirms that changing a customer’s feeling about a company is very difficult. More than 70% of surveyed users who gave a negative review in the past remain critics. The converse is also true, but to a lesser extent. Previously endorsers of a product degrade to detractors about 18% of the time. Last, as startups’ user bases expand, they are are challenged to keep on exceeding user expectations. But companies can maintain relatively consistent satisfaction scores despite massive increases in customer tickets. The chart above shows the mean customer satisfaction score by the average number of monthly tickets. High throughput service desks observe about 20% lower customer satisfaction than embryonic volume desks. Zendesk maintains an extensive library of benchmarks containing useful insights and benchmarks for startups seeking to deeply understand a customer’s needs and develop a passionate user base, the same way Zendesk has . If you’re looking to understand how your startup performs relative to others, it’s a great place to start.

When we analyzed the impact of location on a startup’s ability to raise capital, we found no statistically significant difference. Startups in San Francisco, Seattle, Pittsburgh, Austin and many other cities all demonstrated similar ability to raise follow-on rounds. But is the same true for investors of various locations?  Do investors across the US invest similarly across Seed, Series A and Series B? They do not. In fact, there is a statistically significant difference in investment patterns of investors depending on their location. The table below contrasts the mean round sizes across Seed, Series A and Series B, by investor headquarters location across firms in California, Massachusetts and New York 1 . Round Sizes in $M CA MA NY Seed 1.1 1.1 1.1 Series A 5.8 6.1 5.0 Series B 13.3 11.3 12.8 Lowest Statistically Different Values Marked in Red Investors in these three states invest similarly at the seed stage. But New York investors write 16-22% smaller Series A checks than their counterparts in CA and MA. Massachusetts investors invest 13-18% less than New York or Californian investors in Series B. T-Tests in both cases produce p-values of 0.0002 or smaller, indicating the values are statistically different. First, let me debunk a fallacious conclusion, that  founders should raise Series As only in CA and MA, and Series Bs in CA and NY. While there are differences in the average investment size,  the two charts below illustrate investors in each of these three geographies underwrite investments of all sizes. The major difference across markets is the relative frequency of smaller and larger investments in aggregate. In certain geographies, investors in aggregate are likelier to underwrite larger investments. To convey this point about investment frequency, I’ve plotted the distribution of investment by size for the three different investor states in Series As and Bs. It’s plain to see investors in each of these three geographies have underwritten investments of all sizes, but the relative occurrence of different round size varies by state. The chart makes plain NY-based investors’ preference for smaller Series As . The yellow curve indicates the most common Series A round from NYC-based investors is around $3M compared to $5M in CA and MA. Interestingly, Series A investments by California and Massachusetts firms display spikes at $5, $10 and $15M, indicating these round numbers have become de facto standard investment sizes. More importantly, it implies entrepreneurs are able to negotiate investment size not based on the cash needs of the business, but perceived value of the company. A parallel chart for Series Bs demonstrates a unique different investment behavior by MA investors who invest much more frequently in smaller Series Bs. Curiously, NYC based investors tend to write more $40M+ checks on a relative basis than either MA or CA investors. These differing investment patterns may have many causes. NY investors may be writing Series A term sheets at earlier stages in startup life-cycles; and the same might be true in Series Bs for Boston investors. Startup sectors may be more or less in vogue in certain cities and different sectors may have wildly different capital needs. For example, local delivery companies and ecommerce companies tend to require more capital than others because they generate substantially smaller gross margins than most enterprise companies, increasing the required round size. There may be more competition in certain rounds in particular regions because firms in that region have decided to focus on Series As or Bs; there may be a different distribution of fund sizes by state. Or it could be regional difference in terms such as  pre-money valuations, ownership thresholds, or employee stock option plan sizes. Whatever the cause, the data should encourage founders to ensure the firms they might engage in fundraising talks have underwritten similar investments to the type the company would like to raise. And the data also supports the idea that soliciting terms from investors across geographies is the best way to obtain market price for their equity. 1 I’ve used Crunchbase data for this analysis from 2011 through October 2014. Crunchbase attributes investments made by multi-geo funds like Bessemer, Matrix, CRV to only one geography, in this case, CA, CA and MA repectively, which introduces some noise into the analysis.

I met a really smart vice president of sales a few weeks ago working in a company with mid-market customer values in the $10-100k per year range. When I asked her about her sales process, she described how her team employs statements of work (SOW), which isn’t something I hear about very frequently in startups, despite the fact they are very powerful sales tools. Statements of work describe the proposed working relationship between a vendor and customer. These are common in government contracts and in the advertising agency world where they are called creative briefs, among other places. But I don’t run across them very often in SaaS. In this company’s case, the sales team uses statements of work during the middle part of the sales process (after qualification before contract) to accomplish three goals. First, to clarify the needs of the customer and set the customer’s expectations of what the product could and couldn’t deliver. Second, to further qualify a customer and establish commitment. Third, to equip the project champion the tools with which to close the internal sale with the ultimate decision-maker. Each of these three points is important, but for me the third one is the most important. Equipping the internal champion with the right tools to make an internal sales successful is just as important as any other part of the sales process, and particularly in the cases complex sales, education sales , or expensive sales. There are many ways to construct a statement of work and they are often industry dependent. But they often contain the following key parameters: A description of the current situation An overview of the challenges and problems the company faces Identifying the key members within the company will make this project successful A list of the key objectives of the partnership A collection of the constraints on the project including budget, deadline, manpower, other vendors etc. Definitions of success, ideally quantitative ones (super-important!) A discussion of alternatives to the partnership and why they aren’t the right way forward A few brief case studies or examples of similar customers who have been successful in the past The statement of work converts the company’s phone or in-person sales pitch into an asset for the internal champion. Additionally, statements of work establish project success criteria which enable post-sales/customer success teams to exceed customers expectations routinely and repeatably. For this reason, SOWs can be a vital document in the handoff between sales and customer success and can also form the basis for better collaboration between the two teams.In addition, marketing also gets involved in order to contribute to product positioning and case studies. So, statements or can align three teams. These documents don’t have to be very lengthy or involved. They are often templated and reused from customer to customer, particularly in pitching customers across the same verticals. But they can be very effective in accelerating sales cycles and aligning the go-to-market teams of your startup.

Startups struggle to set the right price for their products because pricing dynamics in the field don’t obey the laws taught in the classroom. The standard supply and demand curves, drawn above, imply that as price increases demand decreases; that buyers act rationally and that this law is immutable. But this simply isn’t the case. Buyers in the market place violate the traditional supply and demand model all the time. For example, Veblen goods defy the traditional pricing theory. First described by Thorstein Veblen, , an American economist in the early 1900s who taught at Stanford , demand for Veblen goods increases as prices rise. Veblen observed this behavior in the leisure class of his era. Since then, luxury cars, art, wine have been classified as Veblen goods. Above, I’ve drawn the demand curve for Veblen goods. In a complete reversal from the first chart, the red demand line in the Veblen Good case ascends as price grows. The Veblen demand curve isn’t limited to the purchasing patterns of luxury goods. It also manifests itself in SaaS sales processes. Bill Macaitis, the former CMO of Zendesk, described Veblen goods behavior when he and the Zendesk product marketing team began to address enterprise customers to complement their booming SMB (small-and-medium business) business. The product marketing team initially charged a modest premium for the enterprise product. But the experiment failed. Demand was immaterial. As they experimented with other price points, the team discovered demand surged as the price ballooned. Today, the Zendesk enterprise plans cost 10x as much as standard plans . Enterprise buyers, like Veblen’s luxury class, exhibit different buying preferences from other segments. Because their willingness to pay is substantially higher than smaller businesses, these buyers often equate price with quality. At a very small price point, they ask a natural question: Since the product is so inexpensive, is it a a toy or true enterprise solution? In Zendesk’s market, standard supply and demand theory describes behavior in the small to medium business segment and the Veblen goods concept captures the patterns of enterprises. Zendesk’s example illustrates exactly why pricing can be so challenging for SaaS companies. There are two types of demand curves in the marketplace: a standard curve and a Veblen curve. Markets with multiple demand curves aren’t unique to Zendesk. They plague many consumerization of IT startups. These companies initially target end-users with free or inexpensive price points, and eventually use that distribution to win larger contracts. I’ve tried to illustrate this behavior in the demand curve above. The nuances and particularities of each market and each startups go-to-market strategies determine the shape of the demand curve within a segment. Today, there is no single model to describe the schizophrenic nature of different buyer segments. But understanding some of the lesser-known economic theories that describe eccentric supply and demand behavior, like Veblen goods, may help inform and accelerate product marketing’s pricing experiments.

Bill Macaitis, the former CMO of Zendesk, articulates how a SaaS marketing team should operate better than anybody else I’ve met. At a recent Point9 conference, Bill outlined the 9 marketing disciplines of great SaaS companies and how they fit together to create a marketing powerhouse. I’ve copied my notes from Bill’s talk below. Ops & Analytics Team The operations and analytics teams is the first marketing team every SaaS company should build because this team erects the experimental infrastructure for determining which marketing tactics are viable. Over time, it also becomes the largest team. Zendesk employed a combination of products to build this infrastructure including Convertro, Google Analytics, Infer, Optimizely and DemandBase. This team employed sophisticated attribution models to understand precisely how many impressions and the types of impressions were required to catalyze a conversion to paid event. In addition to managing the experiments of performance marketing, the Ops and Analytics team measures qualitative metrics like net promoter score, aided and unaided recall, and sentiment analysis of the brand. These qualitative analyses provided Zendesk insight into the top five reasons users recommended product and the top five reasons users didn’t convert to customers, informative data for adjusting marketing tactics and guiding the product roadmap. Customer Evangelism Zendesk’s strong brand enabled its efficient growth. Bill’s team built the brand by investing in long term initiatives like customer evangelism and content. Bill tasked the customer evangelism team with three goals. First, to identify evangelists; second, to nurture relationships with them; and third to leverage their enthusiasm for the product to drive awareness and ultimate conversions. For example, this team would mine the results of the net promoter score surveys for people who self identified as evangelists. The customer evangelism team would build a relationship with them and eventually ask them to write reviews, speak, or for customers on the company’s behalf, creating a huge library of positive reviews all over the web. Content Bill frames the value of the brand incredibly well. In his words, “A brand is the sum total of all interactions a customer has with the company. I never want a customer’s first interaction with a product to feel like visiting a used car salesman. In SaaS, that means the first visit is the pricing page.” To ensure this didn’t happen, Bill and his content team devised a content marketing strategy that mimicked the buying process of their target customer. The team created content (text, audio and video) for the top, middle and bottom of the funnel. Top of the funnel content focuses on industry questions like the Top 5 Trends in Customer Support, or the Top 10 Interview Questions for Support Teams. Top of the funnel content identifies Zendesk as a helpful resource in the ecosystem to future customers. Middle of the funnel content introduces the company and some of the key value propositions that solve tactical challenges for customers. Bottom of the funnel content focused on a specific features in the product that would trigger a conversion to paid event. Creating content at scale is challenging. So, much of the inspiration for the content came from interviews with different team members within the company. In addition, content is the second largest marketing team at Zendesk. Paid The third largest team is paid acquisition. Many SaaS companies equate paid acquisition to marketing. In Bill’n view, this is short-sighted. Paid is just one part of the nine disciplines of marketing. Zendesk used paid acquisition to target and saturate a particular vertical, geography, customer segment, or company. The Ops and Analytics teams’ infrastructure enabled the company to quickly determine which channels worked to drive leads and which built brand equity . Zendesk used video frequently because it was less competitive than SEO/SEM. They also advertised on the search “Zendesk alternatives” by creating a fictitious alt rock band called Zendesk Alternative . The video went viral, further bolstering the brand. Website/Conversion Team Known better as growth hacking, the Website/Conversion team is a group of front-end and back-end engineers optimizing the various funnels potential users may go through, by creating referral programs, testing new designs on the website and experimenting with incentives. Product Marketing Zendesk’s product marketing team focuses on understanding customer needs, segmenting the market and developing pricing plans to meet their needs. When Zendesk moved into the enterprise, the company tested substantially higher price points. Like other Veblen Goods , Zendesk’s product increased in demand as the team increased the price point. The higher price conferred a greater perception of value and quality to enterprise customers accustomed to paying large amounts for software. Lifecycle Nuturing The typical enterprise customer will have 10-30 interactions with a company before buying software. And because of upsell and cross-sell after the sale, more than half of the customer’s revenue potential occurs after the customer starts to pay. The lifecycle team strengthens the companys’ relationship with the customer throughout this lifecycle. Zendesk marketed to existing customers most effectively by building an internal messaging platform within their product that allowed very granular targeting and segmentation of their users. For example, if a user checks the reports tab frequently and a new advanced reporting feature were released, they might receive free access for 30 days to the advanced reports. Comms The marketing communications team is a PR team managing the brand strategy, brand narrative and the public relations of the company. International Zendesk structured their international team differently than most companies. They hired native speakers of their target countries to work at headquarters in San Francisco. Keeping these marketers at HQ enabled them to stay connected to the company and feel empowered rather than isolated. The field marketing teams complemented the HQ-based marketing teams. But these field marketing teams focused more on user activation, sales enablement and training, rather than feature announcements and content. – Bill has built marketing teams at four very successful companies. It’s plain to see why. He has mastered the structure, organization and management of large scale marketing teams that balance performance advertising and brand building, top and bottom of the funnel, product marketing and growth hacking.

Of the ten most important metrics on a startup’s financial statements , revenue might seem to be the most important. But it isn’t. Gross margin matters more because it is directly tied to a company’s ability spend to grow and achieve profitability. Imagine two startups, both selling products at $1M price points. The first has 5% gross margins and the second has 95% gross margins.  The first company will be able to spend about $50k per sale on Sales & Marketing, Research & Development and general operational costs. The second company will deploy $950k across those departments. That’s quite a competitive advantage for the second business. The second business can afford to pay orders of magnitude more to acquire a customer than the first, and consequently grow much faster. Why might gross margin vary so much across startups? Let’s first define gross margin: Gross margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue Companies reselling products they don’t produce display low gross margins. After all, they must pay someone else for the goods they will sell. For example, Walmart’s gross margin is 25%. They must buy produce from farmers/distributors. Ad networks pay publishers for the right to run ads on their web pages. Tremor Video’s GM is 35%. On the other hand, investors prize SaaS companies  because providing SaaS service costs very little, and consequently these startups record very high gross margins. The median gross margin for publicly traded SaaS companies expands from 50% in year four to just under 75% in year five, as the chart above shows.  Hosting costs and Customer Success costs comprise the majority of SaaS Costs of Goods Sold (COGS). As we’ve seen in a few of the S-1 analyses , COGS can also include professional services costs for some companies, notably WorkDay . SaaS gross margins rise for three reasons.  First, as they grow, SaaS companies amortize hosting costs for their product over a larger customer base. The marginal cost to support incremental customer on cloud infrastructure is relatively small, particularly in multi-tenant environments. Second, customer success teams increase their efficiency with time and scale. A few VPs of Customer Success have told me about a productivity rule of thumb they use to measure their team’s performance. A mature customer success team manages about $2 million in average contract value per manager. But it takes a while to get there and often startups’ initial customer success managers can support somewhere in the $500K- $1M range. As the team matures, fewer customer success managers are needed per customer and consequently this reduces COGS, increasing gross margin. Third, as a SaaS startup scales sales and marketing efforts, develops a brand, broadens the product, the business can often pursue larger customers. Many times the larger customers display a greater willingness to pay for the same product, because the value of software is often much larger in dollar terms than for smaller companies. For these larger contract customers, the marginal support costs are often similar to smaller companies that the contract value substantially higher, increasing gross margin. At the very early stages of a startup, it can be challenging to calculate gross margin correctly. If the team is only six or ten, how much of each employee’s time is allocated precisely to customer support and service? Some engineering time, some CEO time, some sales time. It’s hard to estimate. A good accountant or CFO can help here. Gross margin is a critical number because it informs directly how much as startup can spend to grow. It’s one of the most important metrics in a startup’s financial statements. Keep an eye on it.

In “ Time to Hang Up on Voice ,” Sam Lessin argues voice isn’t the interface of the future for three reasons. First, voice is hard to use in public places because background noise complicates interpretation, and because many people are in earshot, voice isn’t private. Second, speaking to computers is less efficient than typing or using gestures. Third, keyboards are better tools for editing text than voice. But I think he’s wrong if for only one reason: speed. Let’s compare two people at the cutting edge of communication. Barbara Blackburn holds the world record for typing at 212 words per minute on a Dvorak keyboard, a layout optimized for efficiency . Steve Woodmore holds the world record for speaking at 637 words per minute. At the limit of human performance, the spoken word is three times faster than the typed word. For those not competing in Guinness World Record challenges, the median typing speed is about 30-40 words per minute and the median speaking speed is, again, three times that, about 120 words per minute. The ratio is relatively constant. This is the reason we often call each other rather than writing a long response to an email. It’s faster. I’ve tried everything to process emails faster including learning Dvorak. But dictation is by far the fastest. In addition, I’ve found spoken emails sound are warmer, more human, more conversational. Speed also drives the success of Siri and Google’s Voice search which I’m told receive billions of queries per day. It’s just faster to say “weather San Francisco” or “navigate to Sightglass” than to hammer out the the words on the tiny slab of white chiclets. As for using voice in public places, we already do that all the time. We call people. Noise cancellation technology combined with social awareness and modesty mitigates the audio fidelity and privacy questions. But editing text by voice can be a challenge. I suspect for 140 character texts, deleting is faster than editing. And for longer content, I combine voice with keyboard and mouse. Best of both worlds. is optimal and faster than keyboard alone. Voice won’t ever become the only interface. I can’t imagine teens texting by voice in schools, for example. It may never become the dominant interface. But as voice recognition accuracy improves;  as ambient computers akin to the visions painted in Her and Star Trek, whose forbears are already here in the form of MotoX, Moto Hint and Google Glass, become reality; and as users seek greater and greater efficiency in their communication, voice will become an increasingly important interface because of its speed.

In the past, we have benchmarked the revenue per employee of large publicly traded SaaS companies and determined that the average is about $200k of revenue per person.  But, that analysis examined revenue per employee that only one point in time. As Jesse Hulsing pointed out to me, examining this figure over five years reveals quite a bit about the health of the business. Jesse was kind enough to provide data on a handful of category defining enterprise companies, which I’ve used in this analysis. High-growth companies scale their teams very quickly. In fact, the companies in the sample set grew their teams by 56% annually over five years, which nets out to about 8.5x growth, from 204 employees to 1750 employees on the median. Despite the massive growth of these organizations, the best companies are able to maintain or even accelerate their revenue per employee. In fact, increases in revenue per employee as a company scales is an incredibly positive sign of the health of the business. It indicates that the company is achieving economies of scale. Those economies of scale may exist as a consequence of a strong brand, monopoly-like characteristics within their market segment, improving sales efficiency, increases in contract size, better rates of customer upsells, etc. But in all cases, it’s a hallmark of a company whose economics are improving with time. In the chart above, Business Objects, a business intelligence company, sets the benchmark. It’s the fastest revenue per employee growth, recording 18.6% over the five year period. At the bottom of the list, Tableau and QlikTech, two other business intelligence companies, have maintained their revenue per employee despite their high growth. All the companies on this list are exceptional because on the median, they have grown their revenues 77% per year for five years, while maintaining or growing their revenue per employee. A potentially unhealthy business would see revenue per employee contraction over time, meaning the business becomes less efficient with scale. Looking at these trends on an annual basis, we can see that for nearly all the companies in the sample set, revenue per employee has been steadily increasing. Revenue per employee is a lagging indicator of success. Only after the company has hired and grown their team, can they understand the marginal impact of additional people on their revenue results. But it serves as a great longitudinal measuring stick to understand the increasing or decreasing efficiency of the business.

The startup acquisition market is poised to have its best year in nearly a decade. If acquirers maintain the same pace from the first nine months of the year through Q4, more than 450 venture-backed startups will have been acquired, generating more than $25B in proceeds. Given this state of affairs, it’s a good time to take stock of the major trends in the startup market. I’ve observed four: The total number of startup acquisitions has remained relatively constant over the past 14 years. But, the amount of large, disclosed startup acquisitions has decreased by about 25% in the past 14 years. Smaller acquisitions and acquihires have taken up the slack. The average size of disclosed startup acquisitions has increased 10% annually on an inflation adjusted basis. The startup M&A market correlates well with the Nasdaq, with an R^2 of 0.54 Let’s dig a bit deeper into each one of them. As the chart above shows, the total number of venture-backed acquisitions, in red, has exceeded the 14 year average (gray dashed line), every year since 2010. The past four years have been great liquidity years for startups. The blue line shows the number of disclosed value acquisition. In 2014, acquirers will reveal the price of their acquisition 30% of the time. These disclosed acquisitions are most often the very largest ones because accounting rules require disclosure of material acquisitions for publicly traded companies. The number of these presumably large, disclosed transactions has decreased over time, and has been below the 14 year average for the past three years. Said more concretely, smaller, non-disclosed acquisitions have doubled in popularity over the past 14 years. The bar chart above shows the fraction of startup acquisitions with undisclosed prices. This could be because tech companies have achieved such a huge scale that the material acquisitions ten years ago, are no longer material today. Or it could be that major tech acquisitions cost much more today than they did a decade ago. The truth is probably a combination of the two. The average disclosed sale price in the same period has increased about 10% annually, inflation adjusted[2], each year since 2002, substantiating the hypothesis that big acquisitions are fewer in number, but command higher price points. The chart above shows the aggregate value of venture-backed startup M&A activity from 2000 through 2014[1] in orange, using NVCA data . In 2000, M&A activity generated an astounding $92B in proceeds. 2014 will reach about $25B, placing third behind the amounts set in 2000, $92B, and 2007, $33B. I’ve overlaid the price of the Nasdaq Composite in gray. Not surprisingly, the Nasdaq and venture-backed M&A shows strong correlation, an R^2 value of 0.54. When tech stocks are booming, cash is easy to raise in the public markets and share prices are high, decreasing the costs of acquisition compared to bull markets, when the cost of capital can be much higher. The M&A market is vibrant both at the high end of acquisitions and at the acquihire segment. Even better, prices are increasing because valuations are tied to the public markets which has seen a terrific bull run over the past few years. There’s no question we’re in a terrific sellers market. [1] 2014 is estimated based on the first three quarters, using straight-line extrapolation, i.e., I multiplied the number by 4/3. [2] All the dollar figures are inflation adjusted.

This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Today, we’ll explore one of the enterprise behemoths, both in market cap and average revenue per customer: WorkDay. WorkDay envisions being the place of record for all Human Resources data for companies with more than 5,000 employees. WorkDay has grown explosively, but in a very different manner than any of the previous companies we’ve analyzed ( Veeva , Hubspot , Zendesk , Tableau , MobileIron or Box ). Unlike these other companies, WorkDay has employed a huge professional services team in addition in investing massively in their R&D to create a broad suite of products. Just how significant is the professional services component to WorkDay’s business? In 2009 and 2010, the company recognized more revenue from services than subscription. Over time, that figure has fallen, but it far surpasses any of the SaaS companies we’ve analyzed to date. In 2011, the year of the IPO, services still accounted for 33% of revenues. Over time, subscription revenue will continue to increase compared to services revenue. WorkDay deploys its professional services teams at the outset of a customer’s engagement with WorkDay when all the systems integration and data processing must be completed. It’s a critical component to customer success But this involvement decreases with time and tends to be episodic, as does the revenue WorkDay generates from it. In contrast, WorkDay typically signs 3-5 subscription year agreements, so the subscription revenue is a substantial annuity of long duration. Nevertheless, Services revenue will be a significant contributor to revenue for the foreseeable future, because new accounts are the biggest driver for revenue growth, according to the S-1 . Over the past decade, software companies have been advised to limit their services revenue to typically less than 20% of total revenues, counsel which WorkDay has ignored to their great success. Behind this advice is some sage advice, however. Services revenue isn’t a money-maker. WorkDay has operated its Services group at a loss or close to break-even for the three years we have data. The chart above shows these trends and compares it to the Subscription gross margin which has increased by 50%, reaching 75% in 2011, in the same time period. Selling people’s time can’t be leveraged like software. In addition to developing the flagship Human Capital Management application, WorkDay has been building a suite of complementary tools including Financial Management, Procurement & Expenses, Payroll, and Talent Management at the pace of about one product per year. To achieve this enormous product breadth, WorkDay spent an astounding 119% of revenue on R&D, more than any other SaaS company at their stage. In dollars, WorkDay $30M on research & development on revenues of $25.2M in 2009. WorkDay financed this huge investment by coupling long-term, near-million-dollar agreements and nearly $200M in venture capital. The sum total of all this investment in engineering and professional services enabled by big contracts and venture capital is immense revenue growth, more than tripling revenues in just two years, in addition to more than $150M in deferred revenue. WorkDay reached $50M just five years after founding, tying it for third fastest to $50M among the public SaaS companies in this bucket. With only 325 customers at IPO, WorkDay’s revenues are driven by a $500k+ Average Revenue per Customer, second only to Veeva. This figure includes both subscription and service, but is annualized, so the total contract values (TCV) are substantially larger, at least 3-5x. Despite that huge revenue growth, WorkDay has the median amount on Sales and Marketing as a percentage of revenue. And WorkDay’s sales efficiency is also at or better than the median, likely because the contract sizes are so large, they support significant investment in sales and marketing. Because of all the R&D spend, WorkDay’s net income percentage is substantially lower than the median. But because the company has such a huge amount of deferred revenue, the possibility of cross-selling the product suite and lengthy customer lifetimes, it’s easy to justify this continued spend. WorkDay has built a business in a very different manner than most SaaS companies, leveraging large contracts, massive R&D spend and substantial professional services engagements to generate massive revenue growth and create the next monolithic enterprise company.

The WSJ published a recent chart of the 49 startups with billion dollar valuations . According to their research, there have never been as many privately held companies with such high valuations ever. The absolute number of these massively valuable companies alone is amazing. Ten years ago, most of them would have gone public by now. But what other insights can we tease from the data about these very special businesses? First, the Billion Dollar Club (BDC) is nearly evenly split between Consumer and Enterprise companies, as the table below shows. I’ve noted the median dollars raised, the median valuation and the valuation efficiency in the table. The valuation efficiency is the valuation divided by the capital raised. This metric tries to answer the question, how much capital did the startup need to raise to achieve that valuation? This is a somewhat flawed metric[1] but I’m going to use it to compare the relative attractiveness of sectors[2]. Sector Median Raised $M Median Valuation $B Valuation Efficiency Count Consumer 350 2.0 5.7 29 Enterprise 219 1.2 5.5 24 Healthcare 450 1.5 3.2 2 Other 290 2.9 10.0 3 Despite similar representation in the BDC, the median valuation of a consumer company is 67% higher than that of an enterprise company. In fact, 60% of enterprise companies in the group have valuations below $2.5B, as the frequency chart below shows. On the other hand, consumer companies command substantially higher valuations due to faster growth rates and greater revenue opportunities. Next, let’s investigate the Consumer and Enterprise components a bit deeper. I’ve categorized each of the companies in the data set by hand into subsectors and run the same analysis as above to surface material differences across sub sectors. Subsector Median Raised $M Median Valuation $B Valuation Effiency Count Consumer Services 514 1.6 3.1 10 Ecommerce 300 2.0 6.7 11 Hardware 441 6.7 15.1 2 Social Media 267 3.1 11.4 4 I categorized consumer companies into four buckets: Consumer Services (e.g., Spotify, Evernote, Airbnb), ECommerce (JustFab, Fab, Gilt), Hardware (Jawbone, Xiaomi), and Social Media (e.g., Snapchat, Pinterest) Consumer services and Ecommerce constitute the bulk of the Consumer BDC. But the real story are the social media companies who raise substantially less capital to achieve the second highest valuations. Again, this is a result of the fast growth rates, massive user bases and huge monetization opportunities in this segment. The hardware category’s median valuation is heavily influenced by Xiaomi, a super-fast growing Chinese mobile phone company, whose last valuation pegged the company at $10B. Subsector Median Raised $M Median Valuation $B Valuation Effiency Count Big Data 900 4.1 4.6 3 Financial Services 160 3.8 24.6 3 Infrastructure 231 1.2 5.2 3 SaaS 206 1.1 5.3 10 Security 470 1.0 2.2 3 Storage 339 2.1 6.1 2 let’s analyze the enterprise data, similarly broken down into these categories: big data (e.g., cloudera, hortonworks), financial services (e.g., stripe, square), infrastructure (e.g., mongodb, nutanix), saas (e.g., newrelic, insidesales), security (e.g. good technology, cloudflare) and storage (e.g., pure storage). Big Data companies have raised more capital on median than any other category by at least 2x. Cloudera skews this figure, but it’s indicative of the capital requirements to sell products in this very competitive market. The Financial Services companies Stripe and Square record high valuation efficiencies likely because their customer acquisition strategies are developer and SMB focused, which excises the high cost of enterprise sales and positions them more for consumer-like customer acquisition. Company Raised $M Valuation $B Number of Rounds Valuation Efficiency Snapchat 150 10 3 67 SpaceX 115 4.8 4 41 Xiaomi 350 10 4 29 LendingClub 155 3.8 6 25 I was curious which companies recorded the highest valuation efficiencies. The table above lists the top four. Interestingly, these companies all serve different markets: Consumer Services, space travel (Other), Hardware, Financial Services. This indicates to me that it’s possible to create massive businesses in many different categories. It’s fascinating to look at the paths created by the members of the Billion Dollar Club, if nothing else but to inspire us to what we could achieve. [1]The valuation efficiency metric is flawed for many reasons. First, it makes assumptions about why startups raise capital. Second, it assumes that all valuation to revenue multiples are similar (which is not true). Third, it catches companies at different points in their growth trajectories. A better metric would be venture dollars required to achieve a certain level of gross profit. But we don’t have that data, so I’ll use this as a low-grade proxy. [2]This analysis suffers from survivorship bias, because all the companies here are “winners” and the data from their competitors or other entrants who didn’t succeed or haven’t yet succeeded aren’t included in the sample set.

Yesterday, I attended an event held by the IT team of a major bank. When the data analytics team took the stage, I listened with great interest as the chief of the group described their internal struggles with data and the areas where startups might help them achieve their goals. He articulated his team’s needs and goals in a very concise way by bucketing his users into three personas. I’ve summarized these personas below: The Three People That Matter in Data Role Challenges Technology Analyst Reveal trends in data Create and propagate data silos Visualization tools, Spreadsheets, BI Scientist Create models to describe behavior, predict the future and expose anomalies, employing advanced statistics. Spend a huge amount of time manipulating data into an analyzable form Statistical Packages for modeling, ETL tools, Scrubbing and Validation Tools Steward Ensuring the data infrastructure meets the teams needs and complies with company/industry policy Supply the proper infrastructure to met the needs of the data team, manage legal risk, and document data. Master Data Management, Data Lineage, Access Control and Rights Administration, Provisioning This talk reminded me of the notion of personas from my product manager days. Personas are incredibly effective tools for product managers to employ. Personas  focus the product roadmap on  important issues and guide product design. By focusing the team on particular needs, personas ensure that all the major stakeholders’ needs are addressed. For example, I’d never heard the term data steward before. The term data steward was coined in 2007, but the term hasn’t seen nearly the level of adoption garnered by data scientist . But there’s no question that stewards are equally important stakeholders in the purchasing process as analysts and scientists, and startups selling data analysis tools should address their needs, too. Personas become even more powerful when they span organizational divisions. For example, using the product team’s personas, sales and marketing teams can craft the proper message to interest and close a customer, by demonstrating how particular product features solve the customer’s problem. This continuity of personas creates alignment from product planning through to customer sales and success. When used this way, personas provide a framework for the product team to receive feedback from the sales and marketing teams on what’s working and what isn’t. Personas are valuable tools for creating a common language to discuss customers and customer needs. In addition, they ensure all the key stakeholders’ needs are met. Last, personas align a startup’s efforts around particular needs, and focus all the different teams on the same customer issues and needs, saving time and improving the company’s sales effectiveness. Consider using them with your team.

I started working in venture capital three months before Lehman imploded. After the bankruptcy, the fundraising market contracted as investors internalized the new normal of the public markets. Over the past six years, the fundraising markets flipped from quite bearish to mildly bullish to extremely bullish. Or at least, that’s the way it feels to me. I’ve often struggled to convey the magnitude of the change and its unevenness. So I thought I could do it with data. Above, I’ve plotted the mean and median investment amounts for Series As, Bs, and Cs from 2006 to through September of 2014 in the US, as reported by Crunchbase data . The data reveals three trends. First, the Series A market has remained stable throughout the eight year period. In fact, the median Series A in 2006 equals the median in 2014: $5M. Second, Series C sizes have ballooned. The median C round is 2014 is twice as large as the median 2009. Series Bs grew by 60% in the same period. Third the difference between the mean and the median also has become greater in later stage rounds. The Series C mean differs from the median has increased by 160%.  Series A, only about 14%. We’ll explore the causes of this trend by examining the fundraising patterns by quartile. Before we do, let’s look at a summary table of the data. The table below shows the Median Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of round sizes from 2006 to September 2014, the 75% Percentile CAGR, the total percentage change in median round size since 2006 and the median round size in 2014. Round Median CAGR 75th Percentile CAGR Change since '06 Median in '14 A 2.0% 1.0% 6.7% 6.3 B 3.6% 5.2% 42.9% 15.9 C 7.4% 8.4% 75.7% 26.2 When looking at median CAGR over this eight year period, inflation becomes an important consideration. The consumer price index (CPI), a measure of inflation, grew at 2.1% annually, implying Series A sizes are growing at the rate of inflation. Meanwhile Series Bs are growing slightly faster and Series Cs have been experiencing much faster growth. Comparing the Median CAGR to the 75th Percentile CAGR, we can see that most Series A sizes have grown slower than inflation. Meanwhile, top Series B and Series C companies’ round sizes are growing faster than the median. Here’s the data plotted to provide a better sense of the trends. I’ve plotted above the 25th, 50th and 75th quartiles for each of the rounds over the same eight year period. The 75th percentile Series A companies raise as much today as eight years ago. But in the Series B, this cohort raises 25% more and in the Series C, 75% more. These trends are similar but muted for the 50th percentile startups and flat for the 25th percentile companies. The amount of capital raised by VCs in 2014 is on track to double the capital raised in 2013. This data indicates this additional capital seems doesn’t inflate Series As. Rather, startups with momentum in the Series B and in particular, the Series C, are able to raise substantially larger rounds than in the past. The fundraising market’s evolution from bear to bull has been rapid and uneven. Individual Series A companies don’t benefit in the form of larger round sizes nearly as much from the flood of venture capital as later stage companies do. But they do benefit from an increasing number of Series As. As the chart above shows, the share of investment dollars in Series As has increased by at least 50% from about 30% to about 60% in the same time period. Meanwhile, the total number of Series Bs and Series Cs has fallen during the same period, but the companies that do raise command twice the capital as before.

The market for startups raising capital has changed dramatically over the past few years. Round sizes have ballooned: startups raise 50%+ larger rounds than a few years ago. The looming Series A crunch never occurred . Instead, we’ve seen the bifurcation of the Series B market. Series Bs are the spring of hope for some startups who raise megarounds and the winter of despair for others who must compete for increasingly scarce Series B dollars . Meanwhile the seed market is evolving even more rapidly. Seed investors raised $3B in 2013, up 6x from 2011 . In addition, VCs are altering the dynamics of the seed market, increasing seed round sizes by 4x . As a consequence of all this turbulence, there’s a relatively new but important phenomenon I’ve noticed in the seed market: the Second Seed round. Some startups raise an initial seed round of somewhere between $100k-$1M, and six to nine months later, they raise an additional $1M or so. But how common is this second seed round? And how are the Series A fortunes of a startup with a second seed round impacted? Second Seed rounds have grown dramatically in frequency since 2009, as the chart at the top of the post shows, reaching about 100 in 2013. The number of these seeds recorded in Crunchbase data has grown by 140% annually, from only 3 in 2009. This analysis considers only initial seeds greater than $100k that are followed by another seed round for startups in the US. Though 98 seems like a small number, these seed financings represent 7.5% of the reported seed financings in 2013 (of those with disclosed financing amounts). Second Seeds have increased in frequency from about 2% to 7.5% in 2013. These rounds are no longer rare. As Second Seeds increase in prevalence, we can begin to study the impact on a startup’s ability to raise follow on capital. One one hand, startups that raise Second Seeds haven’t built enough momentum to raise Series As (presuming that’s their goal). On the other hand, a Second Seed provides a startup more time to generate greater momentum and achieve milestones to catalyze a Series A financing. Let's compare the fundraising success of startups which raised one seed and those that raised two. The bar chart above contrasts the Series A follow-rate of startups following different seed strategies. Although the Second Seed startups record a 15.8% success rate, a 10% increase compared to the 13.6% success rate of single seeded companies, the difference isn't statistically significant. The potential signaling risk of a second seed is immaterial. As for the typical Series A raised by the two different populations of startups, the conclusion is the same. Both single and double seeded startups raise statistically comparable Series As, somewhere between 4-5 million. Dilution may be the only meaningful difference between a startup which raises one seed and a startup that raises two seeds. But the difference in founder ownership is dependent on the terms of each of those two rounds. Unfortunately, we don’t have that data available to analyze. Second Seeds have become much more common in the past four years. And as long as the Series A market continues to boom, we will continue to see Second Seeds. For some founders, this new financial product, the Second Seed, may be just the right financial product to lock in a great Series A.

I met a founder a few days ago who captured the idea of building brand equity really well. He said something along the lines of, “Every time we provide a magical experience to a customer, we invest in our brand equity. Each time we do something that disappoints them or overtly extracts value from our users, we expend brand equity.” This founder prided himself on continuously investing in and increasing his business’s brand equity over long periods of time. Brand equity is important because it can become a significant part of a company’s value. I copied the image above from an annual Interbrand report on the most valuable brands in the world . In many cases, the brand equity of these businesses are a material fraction of their market caps. The brand recognition and goodwill customers feel towards these brands is an enormously powerful marketing force and hugely-defensible competitive advantage. In fact, Peter Thiel wrote about brand as a core asset of the best startups in his recent book, Zero to One . But brand equity isn’t a topic of many conversations in Startupland because unlike revenue, gross margin, cost of customer acquisition or lead velocity, for startups, immediate changes in brand equity are nearly impossible to quantify. In addition, private companies may have more difficulty convincing investors of the intangible value of a brand. While there are a few popular metrics used to proxy the value of a company’s brand equity, like Net Promoter Score , which may be the most popular one, or referrals as a fraction of total new customer leads, these metrics are like the three blind men feeling different parts of the elephant . They capture part of the concept, but not the essence of it. But as this founder pointed out to me, perhaps the accurate measurement of brand equity isn’t the best way to think about it. There’s a mantra many of us subscribe to: “If you can’t measure something, you can’t understand it. If you can’t understand it, you can’t control it. If you can’t control it, you can’t improve it.” This maxim’s roots lie in Total Quality Management , a branch of operations research to maximize factory output. Needless to say, TQM cares little for brand or external perception. In addition to forming a material part of a company’s value and becoming a powerful marketing advantage, a company that champions brand equity internally will make product decisions in the best interest of their customers. Said more succinctly, focus on the user and all else will follow . This long term view shapes the culture of a startup’s workplace and reinforce values that will attract talented people whose mission aligns with the business. When confronted with an important product or marketing or sales decision, if each member of a startup asks, how can we build our brand equity with this?, then a startup’s management team can rest easy knowing the company is building a long-term competitive advantage, a culture to recruit great talent, a loyal customer base and an asset of compounding value to the business. Even if they can’t measure it.

This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Founded in 2007, MobileIron is a leader in the Mobile Device Management sector. MDM provides enterprises software to manage the mobile phones and tablets of their employees. MobileIron provides three different products: a server product called Core to define and deploy security policies, a client product named Client that enforces these policies on each device and a gateway called Sentry that secures traffic from the device to the enterprise’s servers. MobileIron employs a hybrid delivery model. The company delivers its product both as perpetual license software and as-a-Service. We will explore the differences in these delivery models and the implications for the business. MobileIron went public on Jun 12, 2014 with $100M in revenue and more than 6,000 customers. In the next seven or so charts, we’ll explore how MobileIron built their business using data from their S-1 . We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I’ve used MobileIron colors as a consistent legend. MobileIron company data is brick red, median values are black, and other company values from a basket of about 40 publicly traded SaaS companies are gray. MobileIron recorded $105M in trailing twelve months’ revenue up from $13.8M just two years before. The company has grown faster than the median SaaS business in our benchmark data set, recording a 176% CAGR over this three year period compared. The median company grew by 115% from years 4 to 6 from founding. As I mentioned above, MobileIron is a hybrid business combining both perpetual license and SaaS models. The chart above shows the revenue contribution by product: Perpetual License, SaaS and Services & Support. In large gray numbers, I’ve marked the CAGR for these three years. Two trends surface from the data. First, all lines of business are growing very well and faster than the median SaaS company. Second, Perpetual Licenses form the bulk of the company’s business. Third, the SaaS product has been growing the fastest on an annualized basis over the past three years. Let’s cut the data in a different way and evaluate the share of revenue contribution by product. The Perpetual License, in red, accounts for 66% of revenues, a fraction that has remained constant over the past two years. Service & Support, in green, generates about 20% of revenues, but the share is falling. And SaaS, in blue, accounts for 13-14% of revenues and is increasing slightly. In short, MobileIron still is primarily a software licensing  plus support revenue model, with a SaaS product added to service a small fraction of the customer revenue base. Which of these products is the most attractive for Mobile Iron to sell? First, let’s review MobileIron’s overall gross margin which has increased from 62% to 84% in the past three years, easily surpassing the median of 49% to 60%. As the business has scaled, MobileIron’s gross margin is increasing by 16% per year, a dramatic climb. This increase in gross margin is driven by all three products, as the chart above shows. I’ve plotted the gross margin by product, over time. The Perpetual License product, as we saw in the Tableau S-1 analysis , has very high (95%+) gross margin because the cost of the revenue is small. Customers buy the software and deploy it on their own hardware, so there are no ongoing costs of revenue. In addition, I suspect nearly all customers buy Support & Service, alongside their Perpetual License product, so the account management and customer support costs are borne by the customer. It’s interesting to note that Support and Service operated at a negative gross margin in 2011, meaning the business was losing money for each dollar of services they sold. This could be for many different reasons. The sales team may have decided to do this in order to increase sales velocity, mitigate complexity in the set-up of the product, or perhaps this team was overstaffed relative to the business coming in. It’s difficult to know for sure. The SaaS business’ gross margins have improved dramatically over the past three years, more than tripling. This is likely because the infrastructure costs (servers, hosting, bandwidth, operations teams) required to operate the SaaS product are being amortized over a growing customer base. MobileIron runs their SaaS operation at about 76% gross margin, which is substantially better than the median SaaS gross margin of 61%, in year six. Compared to the benchmark set, MobileIron has historically burned more cash and operated at greater negative income than the median. But in the last two years, the company has made great strides towards profitability and reduced its Net Income as a % of Revenue from -184% to -31%. This reduction in burn has accompanied an amazing revenue growth. MobileIron’s sales efficiency is on the rise. The business now exceeds a sales efficiency of 1.3, meaning one dollar invested in sales and marketing returns $1.30 in revenue in the next year. Given this terrific sales efficiency, it stands to reason the company would invest significantly in growth and the Sales and Marketing Spend as a % of Revenue. MobileIron spent the most of any company in the benchmark set as a percentage of revenue in year 4 at 166% of revenue. But over the past few years, the company has been approaching the median rapidly. As a product of great sales efficiency and heavy sales investment, MobileIron has reached $50M in revenue among the top 10 fastest companies. Interestingly, MobileIron’s R&D spend is significantly above the median. In years 4 and 5, the company spent close to sixty percent of its revenue, the third most of any company in the benchmark set. In year six (2013), that ratio has fallen, but still remains ten percentage points above the six year median of 23%. I’m not sure why this is. It could have to do with the volume of integrations required by such a centralized piece of software. Or the increasing competition in the market place may have also driven heavier investment to differentiate the product. Or it might be something else. MobileIron has been able to accomplish this phenomenal revenue growth with an average revenue per customer (ARPC) of about $17,600, a price point which comfortably supports an inside sales model. MobileIron is an impressive business with terrific revenue growth and is a good example of a hybrid Perpetual License and SaaS business.

Bill Gurley and Fred Wilson have focused on burn rates as an important topic for startups. The immediate question that follows this commentary is: How much does the typical startup burn throughout its life? And what is a “risky” burn rate for a company? I use a rule of thumb to evaluate the burn rate of a Series A startup. I multiply the number of employees by about $10-12k, depending on the location of the company. For example, Bay Area salaries are higher than most other places. If a startup’s current burn rate substantially exceeds the this heuristic, I ask why. But like many others, this shortcut isn’t rooted in analysis. Using a basket of about 60 publicly traded consumer and SaaS companies, I aggregated the net income patterns by years-since-founding. I eliminated outliers to concentrate on the patterns of the “typical” public startup. The bar chart above shows the median monthly net income by sector and years-since-founding. A few patterns emerge from the data. Consumer Companies Consumer companies tend to burn more cash in the earlier years than SaaS companies. This is likely because some consumer companies in the basket delay revenue until achieving large-scale consumer adoption. As consumer companies begin to weave their revenue models into their businesses, net income patterns decline progressively through to year 10, at which point the business nears profitability. The median consumer public startup doesn’t exceed $1M in monthly burn rate at any point during its life. SaaS Companies In SaaS companies, the burn rate is either equal to or smaller than consumer companies in years 2 and 3. In year 4, the paths diverge. SaaS companies, presumably having achieved product market fit, quickly hire large sales and marketing teams. Sales teams require a certain amount of time to learn the product, the sales pitch and build a book of business to eventually achieve quota. During the intervening few months, the company pays a carrying cost of the sales salaries that are not yet offset by bookings or revenue, thereby depressing net income. The median public SaaS company burns $1M or less per month for the first four years. As the business scales, this figure jumps to about $1.5M, at which point the company goes public. Having raised additional capital and subject to additional scrutiny of public investors, burn falls again to sub-$1M per month. Of course, the medians don’t express the variance within the data. I’ve plotted a box plot by sector of the same data. The median values are marked by white lines in the boxes. The 25% and 75% percentile values are the edges of the boxes and the extremes of the whiskers indicate the 5% and 95% percentiles. Again, I’ve omitted the outliers. Now that we’ve established some benchmarks, let’s return to the question of the “risky” burn rate. There is no precise answer for every company as to what a risky burn rate and what a conservative burn rate might be. But there are a few factors to consider. First, the ability of the team and the business to continue to raise capital are the most important factors. Part of this ability lies within the team, and the team’s ability to position and sell the story of the business. Another component is the market’s receptivity to the story given the financial conditions of the market, which is harder to gauge and difficult to predict. Second, the current runway or months-of-cash remaining as compared to the timing of the next milestone. Ideally, companies count 6 to 9 months of cash on their balance sheets when they attain the target milestones to raise their next round. Third, the unit economics of the business matter a great deal. If the unit economics of a startup are strong, that’s a great leading indicator to finance growth and increase burn. If the company hasn’t yet achieved contribution break even, then it’s often prudent for the business to reduce spend until the math is proven out. One of the main responsibilities of the management team and the board is cash management and financial planning. Understanding the impact of the business’s burn rate is an essential component of this responsibility. Benchmarks like the ones above can help, but should be used in conjunction with milestone planning for fundraising. Note: I analyzed net income, not free cash flow, for startups mostly because the data is more readily available. But for certain businesses, FCF can be a better metric to evaluate true cash burn than net income.

The startups that build and retain the best teams develop a huge competitive advantage. It’s no surprise that managers are the most important influencers of team development and retention. The most frequent and consequently most powerful tool for managers to coach, develop and lead their teams are one-on-ones, weekly meetings between a manager and his or her individual reports. Most one-on-ones are ad-hoc, loosely structured 15-30 minute meetings. While extemporaneous meetings can work, leaders who manage their teams this way forgo an important opportunity to further their team’s success. So, how does a manager run excellent one-on-ones? In How Google Works, Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg, former-CEO and SVP of Products at Google, articulate the structure for one-on-one meetings prescribed to Google by the legendary mentor Bill Campbell , who has advised Steve Jobs, Scott Cook and many other pioneers, including a few Redpoint founding teams. There are two parts to Bill Campbell’s one-on-one structure: a list compiled before the meeting and a format for the meeting. Before each meeting, both the manager and the report should write down the five things each want to cover in the meeting. At the start of the meeting, they should compare lists, and they should find significant overlap. This initial step confirms both people are prioritizing the same tasks. If the lists diverge meaningfully, it’s time for the manager to reassess, coalesce and articulate the priorities of the team. After running through those five to seven line items, Campbell suggests structuring the meeting in four sections: Performance on job requirements : This is the time to review sales figures, product milestones, customer satisfaction, budget numbers, etc. Relationships with peer groups : As a startup grows, cross-team collaboration becomes increasingly important to achieving milestones. Discussing the state of these relationships can expose limiting factors in the team’s success, places where a manager can exert influence to dissolve roadblocks. Leadership : Growth, learning and self-actualization are keys to employee happiness and success. A fraction of the 1/1 should be focused on helping a report develop those skills which include mentoring other teammates, hiring and firing, and team motivation. Innovation : This is the time during the 1/1  to make sure the teammate is continually thinking ahead, asking hard questions of the team and the business and surfacing novel trends/technologies/best practices from outside the team. Terrific managers and team leaders alter the trajectory of their startups by inspiring, enabling and empowering their teams to achieve audacious goals. Great management is a discipline, a daily practice of small things like a well-structured 1/1, that when summed across years of collaboration create dramatic and sweeping change.

I remember many the great TED talks I’ve watched. Sir Ken Robinson’s ,“How Schools Kill Creativity” and the story of a little girl whose genius was unrecognized in school until she was allow do dance, and ultimately became a prima-ballerina, is simply unforgettable. In most of my meetings, I remember Amy Cuddy’s “Body Language” talk for a split-second. Commanding her body language changed her career. And who can forget Steve Jobs announcement of the iPhone? Presentations can be incredibly persuasive, and particularly in business, whether for closing candidates, pitching investors to fund raise, interviewing with the press and so on, they can materially impact the course of a startup. But it’s really hard to tell a good story. Most of us have never studied the craft of constructing a story: how to draw the arc of the storyline, how to elicit emotions with dramatic tension, or how to entice the audience into conspiring with us in the plot. The best book I’ve found on building compelling presentations is Nancy Duarte’ Resonate. In Resonate, Nancy explains the three different key components of memorable, effective pitches: the journey the speaker would like the audience to traverse, the framework for creating a good story, and the mechanism to bring the two together. Duarte argues a successful presenter convinces the audience to believe in a new idea. To achieve this goal, the presenter must deliver a compelling story that paints the ordinary world of today and contrasts it with the special world of the future. The presenter must call the audience to embark on the adventure, handle their immediate objections to this invitation, and then establish the presenter as the mentor through the process. Those are the first four steps of the Audience’s Journey.  The diagram above shows the remainder of the twelve steps through which a great presenter leads her audience. If this feels familiar, it should. This journey forms the arc of every great story. To prove the point, Duarte diagrammed the audience’s journey with Luke Skywalker in Star Wars and the book has many similar examples. Next, the book introduces us to the story template, which is a MadLibs-style fill-in-the-blank for crafting the arc of the story. This template follows the Situation, Complication, Question and Answer philosophy and demands simplification of the storyline. As Duarte writes in her book, complexity kills presentations. Last, Duarte combines synthesizes the output of these two frameworks into a spark line, like the one above for the iPhone announcement by Steve Jobs. Time is demarcated along the x-axis. Along the y-axis, the spark line shows whether the presenter is talking about the present or the future. Along the bottom, Duarte has noted when the audience claps and laughs, and when Jobs marvels at his own product. The relationship between these four time series shows how well Jobs is able to convince the audience to see his vision and share his wonder for this product. Spark lines can be great planning tools as well as great feedback loops to improve presentations. Great pitches oscillate between between what is and what could be. Duarte shares similar spark lines for Richard Feynman, physicist extraordinaire, and his lecture on gravity, and Benjamin Zander, conductor of the Boston Philharmonic and his TED talk on music , among others. In her book, Duarte dissects other great speeches including Martin Luther King’s “I Have A Dream” and Ronald Reagan’s Challenger Disaster announcement. The best presenters contrast the present and the future throughout the presentation and when down successfully, this seesawing drives the audience t o believe the presenter’s vision. Resonate is a powerful book because it reveals all the tricks of the magician presenters and shares the tools to craft compelling, memorable and trajectory-changing stories.

This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. All of the businesses we’ve looked at in the past have been purely SaaS businesses. Today, we’ll examine Tableau, the market leader for data visualization software. Tableau sells software the old-fashioned way, with perpetual licenses not subscriptions. Customers pay a fee for the software up-front, in addition to an annual maintenance fee of about 20-25%. To offset the mostly one-time payment from customers, Tableau employs a land-and-expand strategy.
The company went public in 2013 and we’ll use data from their S-1 through 2013 to benchmark the business. Tableau sells their desktop client to one or two data analysts within a company. Many times, these first analysts download the product on the web and convert to paid with a credit card. Over time, colleagues within the company see the software and purchase it for themselves. Sometimes, teams buy a Tableau server license to collaborate internally on data analysis. When enough employees of a company use Tableau, the company is able to sell an enterprise-wide license, but these very large transactions are still quite few in number. Tableau closed 179 transactions of greater than $100k ACVs in the first quarter of the year up from 80 three quarters before . In the next seven charts, we’ll explore how Tableau built their business. We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I’ve used Tableau’s colors as a consistent legend. Tableau company data is blue, median values are black, and other company values from a basket of about 40 publicly traded SaaS companies are gray. Founded in 2003, Tableau followed a more gradual revenue growth curve than the median SaaS company. But since the company hit its stride, about six years after founding, Tableau has been growing rapidly, recording a 94% CAGR for the last four years, and generating $232M of revenue in 2013. 70% of that revenue is one-time software license fees and 30% is recurring service and support. Tableau does sell a SaaS product (a hosted version of its desktop client), but the most recent quarterly reports indicate the revenue contribution is de minimus . At IPO, Tableau’s average customer paid $12,773 for roughly six to seven seats. This average revenue per customer (ARPC) places the company in the 25% percentile for size of ARPC and below the median of $29k, indicated as the dashed blue line in the chart above. As mentioned above, these small initial deployments ultimately lead to much larger enterprise licenses measuring at least in the five figures and the pricing is part-and-parcel of the land and expand strategy. Tableau has the best gross margins of any company in the SaaS basket, 92%, compared to the median of 68%. Tableau’s margins are thirty-five percent better than the median SaaS publicly traded company for two reasons. First, Tableau’s software is sold as a client, an application users download to their machines and run in place, so there are no ongoing hosting or server costs. Second, customers pay for their own customer support and success as part of a typical deployment. Instead of contributing to the cost of revenue, customer success is a revenue line item. Tableau’s sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue traces the median at about 50%. While there is nothing special about this figure, there is about the next one. For every sales and marketing dollar Tableau invests, the business returns more than $1.54. Only LinkedIn and DealerTrak have better sales efficiencies for companies this “mature” (seven years or more since being founded). Tableau achieves such terrific efficiencies by combining a freemium product with focused account expansion sales effort. Since the ultimate purpose of data analysis is to share insight, the software’s end product, data visualization, is often distributed broadly within its customers’ companies, engendering new interest which can be converted into account growth by the sales team. Perhaps as a consequence of remarkable sales efficiency, Tableau has required very little capital to grow. The founders raised only $15M before taking the company public. At the end of 2012, six months before the company would trade publicly, the business counted $39.3M of cash on its balance sheet, meaning the business either hadn’t spent very much of the capital it raised or had spent it early and then replenished its cash balance with profits over time. Since at least 2010, Tableau has been run profitably. In each of the years we have data on the business, the company never exceeded $8M in net income, and this is likely because the company plows all the potential profits back into customer acquisition and upsell. Tableau is among the slowest companies in the set above to reach the $50M revenue milestone, taking 8 years to exceed it. Tableau’s cash-conservative approach may have been necessary given the perpetual sales model. Tableau could count only on about 25% of their revenue to recur, the support and maintenance fees. Describing the business through a SaaS lens, one might say Tableau charges a higher upfront price than a SaaS product might, but suffers from roughly 10-11% monthly revenue churn. Managing this type of business is very different from today’s SaaS model, and the increased unpredictability of customer behavior likely demanded a more conservative operating plan. Tableau spends 26% of revenues on research and development, about 37% more than the median SaaS company. And they have been investing at this rate for as long as we have data to measure it. It may be that client software is more expensive to develop and maintain or that the footprint of the software is more expansive and requires greater development effort. There is a tradeoff between the predictability of the SaaS business model and the margins of a perpetual license model. Tableau has been able to grow very much like a SaaS company, and arguably required less capital, though it has taken the business some more time to achieve the milestones and the company doesn’t benefit from the long-term revenue streams that subscription customers offer. As the company scales, I expect to see Tableau experiment with generating more consistent, and likely subscription revenue from existing customers either with subscription products, paid upgrades, more collaboration or other features. Tableau is an impressive company for many reasons: terrific revenue growth, tremendous sales efficiency and a beautiful product. For founders it serves as a great role model for building a perpetual license business and a foil for the SaaS model of commonplace today.

Jason Fried, co-founder of 37Signals and Basecamp , published a blog post today called Faith in Eventually that captures the emotional tensions of building a product: During the development of most any product, there are always times when things aren’t quite right. Times when you feel like you may be going backwards a bit. Times where it’s almost there, but you can’t yet figure out why it isn’t. Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn’t quite what you’re seeing in front of you. Yet. That’s when you need to have faith. My favorite line from the post is this one: Remember that what you’re making is in a perpetual state of almost right up until the end. Today, many products are perpetually in a state-of-almost. Being in that state-of-almost means the product is living, evolving, changing and improving. Only when they sunsetted, retired and shut down do they stop being in the state-of-almost - in other words, complete. Years ago, software development teams planned and feverishly coded their way to a final copy of the software called the General Availability version that would be burned onto a gold disc and then copied onto thousands of CDs or DVDs, or distributed in some other fashion. At that point, the product and engineering teams could plant a flag and claim to be done - at least for a while. But, today, most of the web and mobile software development is no longer managed this way. Many startups release new Generally Available versions of their software several times daily. At Redpoint, we use RelateIQ for our CRM and the message “RelateIQ is out of date. Please refresh your browser” is a daily reminder of the efforts of the RelateIQ team to continuously improve the product. This rapid deployment pace places product and engineering teams  continually in the state that Jason described in the first excerpt above - the struggle to create the perfect product. This idea is a really important one, especially today. It’s the part of SaaS, we don’t talk about very frequently, the Service part, service to the user. The very best products are the ones that are perpetually in a state-of-almost. They are the ones that rise to meet the needs of their users, even as those needs change over time.

Startups are intense experiences. Driven by a burning passion to change some aspect of the world, startup teams push, push, push to grow as fast as possible. Without the right balance, though, teams burn out - a terrible outcome.  One of the most important responsibilities of every startup’s management team is to shepherd their teams to maximize their performance and prevent burnout. But how? Tony Schwartz founded The Energy Project , a consultancy that focuses on educating managers on how to manage their team’s energy, to maximize long-term team performance and well-being. The company works with Google, eBay and lots of other Fortune 500s. Schwartz wrote a book on the topic called The Power of Full Engagement . I haven’t read the book, but I’m a believer in one of the frameworks within it, the 2x2 matrix above. Energy is marked on the y-axis and emotional state on the x-axis. Burnout, the worst-case scenario, occurs when people have negative emotions and low-energy. Many of us know this feeling well. The best place to be on the 2x2 is performance, when we have lots of energy and positive emotions about our work. Survival occurs when we are producing lots of work, but express negative emotions. And renewal is positive emotions, but low energy. I’ve tended to cycle between survival and performance. I suspect many people in Startupland do too. But this isn’t the optimal quadrant-pair. Instead, and it might seem counter-intuitive at first, the better cycle is between renewal and performance. The renewal/performance cycle very sharply reduces the possibility of burnout, by reinforcing positive emotions. To make use of this energy framework, a manager should routinely, even weekly, take stock of which quadrant the team is in. How is the team’s energy? How upbeat is the team? These sentiments can surface in many places, but often arise in one-on-ones. To shift teams from the left-side of the matrix to the right side requires rebuilding positive energy. The Energy Projects divides energy into four types: Physical : Is the team getting enough exercise and sleep? Are they eating well? Do they take regular breaks to recharge during the day? Emotional : Does the team find the time to work on projects they enjoy? Do teammates regularly share appreciation for work well done? Mental : Does the company provide the team an environment in which they can focus on their work? In which they can switch between reactive work and proactive thinking and long-term planning? Does the company respect work-life integration , if not balance? Spiritual : Does the team feel committed to the vision of the business? Do they feel unified within their team? Does the company inspire them with a strong sense of purpose and act in ways consistent with their values? By breaking down the team’s current state into these four buckets, managers can identify and address potential transitions burnout or to survival mode, keeping the team happier and more productive for the long term. I like this framework because it provides tactical advice to managers on how to identify where their team may be. In addition, the responses fall pretty neatly out of the questions. Too little sleep? Time to reallocate work across the team or prioritize better. Not enough focus? Reduce meeting volume or concentrate meetings into chunks. Lack of commitment to the vision? Let’s spend some time with the CEO and some customers.

This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. In the two most recent analyses, we’ve explored the S-1s of Hubspot and Zendesk, two of the public SaaS companies with the smallest Average Revenue per Customer. Today, we’ll look at Veeva, masters of the massive enterprise sale, and one of the most remarkable SaaS businesses. At the time of its IPO, Veeva employed about 600 people. Veeva offers a CRM tailor-made for the life-sciences/pharmaceutical industry and built atop Salesforce’s Force.com platform. In addition, the company provides its customers tools to manage clinical trials for healthcare treatment approvals. In the next seven charts, we’ll explore how Veeva built their business. We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I’ve used Veeva’s colors as a consistent legend. Veeva company data is orange, median values are black, and other company values from a basket of about 40 publicly traded SaaS companies are gray. Before diving into the benchmarks too deeply, I want to explain how different Veeva’s business is than most. No chart explains the distinction than the one above, Average Revenue per Customer. Veeva generates $780,000 per customer, 26x the median SaaS company (the blue dashed line). Only Workday comes close. Although Veeva focuses on a small universe of life-sciences companies (at IPO, the company served fewer than 200 customers), the unique value of their product enables them to command a huge amount for their software. In addition to the massive ARPC the company commands in the market, Veeva leverages the Force.com platform to reduce its time-to-market with its product. Veeva is essentially built on top of Salesforce and hence benefits from all the engineering effort Salesforce invests into its own product, reducing the total investment Veeva must make to satisfy its customers. The combination of high ARPC, unique product and speed to market enabled Veeva to become the third fastest growing SaaS company yet, reaching $61M in year 4 of its life, $130M in year 5 and $210M in year 6. For the four years of reported revenue, the company sustained a 93% CAGR, astounding figures. Only two companies, Salesforce and DealerTrak, have outpaced Veeva’s growth. Because of the concentration in Veeva’s customer base, the business doesn’t require a huge sales team. The net-impact of Veeva’s sales efficiency is a hugely favorable one. Veeva’s sales spend as percentage of revenue has averaged 18.5%, less than a third of the median of 56.5%. This customer concentration enables the sales team to focus on key, named accounts, which translates into a remarkable sales efficiency of 3.0. In other words, one dollar spent in sales and marketing translates into 3 dollars (!) next year for the business. This median figure is the best in the business. The other contender for the crown is Xero who recorded a 4.8 sales efficiency is year 6, but that business experiences a much greater degree of volatility in their sales efficiency and notched a four year median of 1.8, about 40% less than Veeva. It’s hard to know from the S-1, but I suspect a material fraction of the incremental gross profit must be derived from revenue growth within accounts, rather than addition of new customers. After all, winning a dollar from an existing customer is much more efficient than willing a dollar from a new customer. The sales efficiency hypotheses foots with the gross margin numbers, which are effectively identical to the median. In other words, Veeva’s cost to support a customer, likely dominated by customer success but also inclusive of infrastructure costs, are on par with the rest of the field. Veeva invests roughly the same proportion of revenue as other SaaS companies in maximizing customer happiness. And considering the revenue concentration in just a few hundred accounts, this money is well spent because churn of a few percentage points per year can reduce revenue materially. Veeva is the most profitable company in this basket of public SaaS companies. Over years 3-6 from founding, the business recorded a median profitability of 12.3% and was profitable in each of the four years. Ticker Years Profitable (Years Since Founded of 3-6) Median Profitability VEEV 4 12.3% TRAK 4 9.8% CRM 2 6.7% LOGM 1 11.8% Only one other company, DealerTrak, another vertical SaaS company building software for car dealers recorded four years of profitability, although Veeva’s profitability median exceeded TRAK’s by about 26%. Salesforce and LogMeIn were the only two other companies to log profitable years in the same company epochs. Veeva’s capital efficiency is remarkable. The business raised only about $4.5M and then a few years later went public. The same story bears out in the Net Income chart, this time shown in gross dollars. Veeva continues to generate profits, not needing to reinvest all of their profit-dollars to create near 100% annual growth. Again, because the company built its product on the Force.com platform in a multi-tenant fashion, Veeva incurs very little development costs compared to the median. Veeva’s investment in R&D has averaged 12% over the past four years, 42% lower than the median during the same period. Again, only Salesforce and Dealertrack invested less in their product as a fraction of revenue than Veeva at year five. All in all, Veeva is a very special business. It’s the canonical example of a highly specialized SaaS business serving a small number of customers very well. This focus on one use case enables the company to command premium revenue per account and ultimately create one of the most efficient SaaS companies in history.

What will the world look like when cloud compute and storage are free? Cloud computing prices are hurtling to zero. The chart above shows the logarithmic decline of the cost of a transistor cycle by 11 orders of magnitude (11 decimal places) over the past 40 years. AWS has decreased prices for EC2, elastic compute cloud, and S3, simple storage service, 42 times in eight years. Storage is following a similar path. Dropbox is now selling 1TB for $10 per month and Google offers 10TB for $100 per month . Meanwhile, gigabit internet has been deployed in about 8 cities in the US so far with another 12 to 15 slated for next year , typically at $70-$100 monthly price points. Presuming the trend continues, and computational power becomes free, or near free, what new technologies are enabled by it? The first manifestation of large scale, near-free compute I’ve seen is in machine learning. When I worked at Google in 2005, we would test individual machine learning models one or two at a time. Today, it’s possible for any company to test millions of machine learning models in parallel in minutes by distributing the work across tens, hundreds or thousands of machines with the push of a button. These advances will shape the next era of SaaS companies and consumer companies pursuing anticipatory computing , and nearly everything in between. The second manifestation is Bitcoin, which could become the next major protocol for the internet. Bitcoin miners use huge amount of processing power to validate transactions between buyer and seller of the currency. Without access to this computing power, the blockchain, which is the ledger of all Bitcoin accounts, could quickly be hacked and the currency destabilized. The third manifestation is next-generation databases, like Redshift , that enable data processing on a massive scale with sub-second response times. The benefits of these databases have already cascaded to business intelligence and will undoubtedly benefit other fields. Access to near-unlimited computational power and storage will define many of the key technology innovations in the next decade. This transformation enables startups to challenge the first order assumptions about what can and can’t be done, and will surely lead to explosive innovation.

I wish I had been in Stanford’s CS183 class in 2012, the year Peter Thiel taught it. A student of the class, Blake Masters, copied all the class notes and I read every post, like thousands of other visitors to the site. In a few days, Thiel and Masters will release a book version of these notes called Zero to One: Notes on Startups or How to Build the Future. I was given a copy at TechCrunch Disrupt. Over the past day or so, I’ve read it in its entirety. Every person curious about or in the world of startups should read it, because it contains so much original thought. These are my three favorite ideas from the book. Idea 1: Founders should aim to create monopolies. Because a business’ current value is the sum of its discounted future profits , the businesses that maximize long-term profits are the most valuable. But, competition increases costs. So, to maximize profits and minimize costs, a startup should prohibit competitors from developing. In other words, founders should build monopolies.  (p. 48-53) Four attributes characterize monopolies. First, proprietary technology. Second, network effects that enable the business to grow faster as it scales. Third, economies of scale which reduce the costs of growth over time. Fourth, a brand. All of these elements create barriers to entry that defend the future profits of the startup and reinforce monopoly power. Idea 2: Disruption is the wrong mind-set. Today’s mantra of disrupting industries focuses startups on existing competitive markets. Competitive markets reduce profits to zero.  Most disruptive companies are better, faster, and cheaper versions of incumbents’ products. Without a fundamental cost advantage, a cheaper product is a less profitable product. Consequently, the disruptive company offering the product is less valuable. Instead of disrupting, founders should be focused on creating new markets and technologies where none exist. (p. 56-57) Idea 3: The four lessons we learnt from the dot-com era are wrong. The turbulence of the dot-com era engendered a more conservative startup development philosophy: the Lean Startup. Thiel argues the major concepts of Lean Startup don’t create the most valuable types of companies, monopolies. I’ve listed those concepts below with Thiel’s counter-argument written after the double colon. (p. 20-21) Make incremental advances :: Incremental advances don’t lead to defensible technology. Stay lean and flexible :: A bad plan is better than no plan. Improve on the competition :: Competitive markets destroy profits. Focus on product, not sales :: Superior sales and distribution can create monopoly, even without product differentiation. The converse is not true. Each of these ideas has arguments and counter-arguments. Because these ideas differ so much from the conventional wisdom, they arresting and demand deeper thought. I suspect one of the ramifications of publishing the book is there will be many founders and investors debating their applicability. Aside from these three ideas, the book includes many other great tactical concepts including thoughts on the composition of a founding team, startup culture, and go-to-market strategies. In addition, Thiel discusses the philosophy of the day (" indefinite optimism ") and discusses the challenges with this mindset. The book differs from the notes in one important way: it’s written in Thiel’s voice. Consequently, the stories are more tangible and the arguments are more forceful than in the notes, but they are also more concise. I found myself going back to the notes for some more context around particular arguments. Together, they are a great resource for founders. Zero to One is a great read and an important book because the key ideas of the book will become part of the language of the valley.

Is there an optimal price for a product to maximize a SaaS startup’s sales efficiency ? As I’ve been analyzing the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies, most recently of HubSpot and Zendesk , I’ve been asking myself that question. Do million-dollar enterprise price points and field sales people create more efficient sales organizations than content-marketing-driven SMB startups? Or are the high-velocity inside sales teams of the pursuing the mid-market, the most efficient? Using a basket of about 45 publicly traded SaaS companies, I analyzed the sales efficiency of these companies by years since founding for different average contract value (ACV) buckets of $15k, $50k, $120k, and $1M. Then I calculated the sales efficiency by year-of-founding, in buckets of 2 years, from year 2 through year 10. To eliminate bias, I whittled the dataset to a subset of the companies who had data in all three periods. The chart above shows the result. On first blush, we could conclude $1M ACV companies seem to be more efficient in the company’s early days. We could speculate that this is because an individual salesperson selling million-dollar contracts can be much more efficient than an individual inside sales rep selling $10k products. One million dollar sale is worth the same as one hundred $10k sales. But this initial difference isn’t actually statistically significant. In fact, within any of the three periods, and across the four different ACV categories, the data today shows that there is no optimal ACV that would enable maximum sales efficiency. There is another important conclusions from the data: sales efficiency is monotonically decreasing. The rate of decrease seems to be largest for $1M and $15k ACVs, while companies operating within the  middle range of ACVs display a slower decline rate. The median SaaS company selling a $1M product declines from a sales efficiency of 1.7 to 0.9 in about 6 years, a 47% drop. In contrast, the $50k ACV median falls 9%. This could be because the high-velocity inside-sales models can create more repeatable, similar-looking sales. Consequently, sales efficiency deflates to a lesser extent as the company grows, in comparison to field sales team expansion with highly variable quota achievement, and content-marketing driven customer acquisition. But, I don’t have the data to prove that hypothesis. If you’re looking for more detail on the data, I’ve included a box plot above. The box plot that shows the distribution of the data by ACV in greater detail. The line in the middle of the box is the median, the outer borders of the box show the 25th and 75% percentile of values, and outliers are shown as points. The one challenge of this data analysis is the sample size is relatively small. I hope to refine it over time as more SaaS companies go public and contribute to the data set. The methods used to achieve similar sales efficiencies across these different ACVs varies dramatically, but the underlying performance of the median public SaaS company, isn’t meaningfully different.

This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Zendesk is a 700 person company that builds customer support software. Zendesk went public earlier this year. It’s a remarkable business primarily because the founders and the team have built an incredibly efficient customer acquisition funnel. It’s important to note that Redpoint is an investor in and shareholder of the company. In the next seven charts, we’ll explore how Zendesk built their business. We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I’ve used Zendesk’s colors as a consistent legend. Zendesk company data is green, median values are black, and other company values are gray. All the data come from Zendesk’s S-1. Zendesk has matched the SaaS median for revenue growth each year, and slightly exceeded it in 2013. The company has achieved a 114% CAGR from 2011 through 2013, an impressive growth rate. In fact, Zendesk is the 10th fastest growing SaaS company, reaching about $70M of revenue in its sixth year since founding. LOGM, TLEO, LNKD and ZEN achieved the same scale of revenue at the same time, relatively speaking. Setting the standard, Salesforce recorded more than $300M in its sixth year. Zendesk’s gross margin which is Revenue minus Cost-of-Revenue (customer support, infrastructure team and expenses, and also the compensation expenses typical at IPO) divided by revenue has exceeded the median for the past few years and is converging to the median of about 70%. This means Zendesk’s costs of providing their service are lower than typical SaaS publics. In gross dollar terms, Zendesk burns more cash to grow than the average SaaS company. In the past two years, Zendesk recorded net losses of about $23-24M each year, while the typical SaaS public burns about $13-14M. but because zendesk’s revenue has been growing so quickly, the gross net income figure as a fraction of total revenue is identical to the median saas publicly traded company. so, zendesk’s spending is actually in line with other saas publics on a relative basis. this spending is broken into two main categories: r&d and s&m. Zendesk has historically spent more than the median on Research and Development (R&D)/Engineering. I suspect part of this might have to do with the vast number of integrations with their customer service suite. By becoming the data repository for customer interactions from email, social media, CRMs, bug tracking and all other types of software both accelerates sales cycles and leverages partners to grow. Some might argue that the relatively heavier investment in R&D should reduce the need for Sales & Marketing expense. But that’s not the case here. Zendesk’s S&M outlay as a percentage of revenue matches the median. This means Zendesk spends as much as the typical public SaaS company to acquire new customers. But here’s the kicker: the investments in both R&D and S&M which are substantial enable spectacular sales efficiency . A sales efficiency of 0.8 means a company must spend $1M in Sales and Marketing to generate $0.80 in revenue. In 2012, the company posted a sales efficiency of 1.4 and in 2013, a figure of 1.0, compared to 1.1 and 0.71 for the median. This means for the same spend as a typical public SaaS company, Zendesk acquires at least 25% more revenue.  This sales efficiency is enabled by the combination of a great product, terrific sales and in particular community marketing within the customer support world. Today referrals provide more than 40% of Zendesks’ traffic , about 10 percentage points more than direct visitors - an amazing figure for a B2B product. Ticker Year Since Founding Gross Profit in $M Sales Efficiency VEEV 5 72.5 3.3 XERO 5 2.6 1.9 WDAY 5 40.5 1.7 DWRE 5 5.9 1.7 ZEN 5 25.0 1.4 Putting the sales efficiency figures into context, ZEN is the fifth most efficient SaaS business I’ve measured. Five years since founding, Zendesk recorded a sales efficiency of 1.4.  The table above compares the other top SaaS companies by sales efficiency in year five. Veeva is an amazing outlier, a product of a very high average customer value and very few customers. Notably, DemandWare and Xero achieved the number on far smaller gross profit figures. Any way you measure it, Zendesk is one of the most efficient SaaS businesses yet. Amazingly, Zendesk is able to achieve this efficiency with one of the smallest average revenue per customer figures in the market, of about $1800 across 40,000 customers when they filed their S-1. Like HubSpot, Zendesk has been able to create efficient customer acquisition channels to amass   a huge customer base upon which they’ve built a terrific business.

Following this week’s post Benchmarking HubSpot’s S-1, Josh and Nikos raised an interesting question on Twitter . What are the right ways to benchmark SaaS companies from their early days through IPO? I have always used years-since-founding as the time axis to compare companies, because if I were a founder, that’s how I might think about benchmarks. But after their comments I wondered if there were better ones. Some potential alternatives are: Using time before/since-IPO for the time axis. Grouping companies by ACV to compare growth rates Grouping companies by Revenue at IPO to compare growth rates First, let’s compare using years-since-founding to years before/after-IPO. Below I’ve plotted revenue growth for each of these two timelines. I’ve applied a basic predictive function (loess), which is marked in blue. In the first chart, the predictor does a fairly good job of capturing the spirit of the data. There are one or two outliers growing at 200%+, but the curve matches the data set pretty well. When plotting the same data by year since IPO, the data is much more dispersed. Consequently, the predictor’s fit isn’t as good and the relationship isn’t as strong. In fact, the years-since-founding predictor is twice as accurate, recording an R^2 value, a measure of line-fitting accuracy, more than twice as big as the IPO-based x-axis. The argument for using years before/since IPO is that startups may be founded in tougher fundraising environments, pursue a pivot or take some other scenic route to IPO, which would delay their revenue growth when compared to other companies on a years-since-founding axis. But the data suggests this is a pretty infrequent occurrence. Nikos suggested using years since $1M ARR. Unfortunately, since most companies only report 2-3 years of revenue before their IPO, I’m able to calculate the year of $1M in ARR for only than 15% of companies in my dataset. Increasing the ARR figure to $10M captures about 50% of companies. But years-since-founding includes all the companies’ data points. In this case, I believe more data is better. So, I’m going to keep using years-since-founding because it’s a more consistent predictor and the data set is larger, which ought to provide the better context for benchmarking. As for grouping companies in benchmark buckets rather than using the global median, we could create buckets based on average customer value and determine if the growth rates at IPO are correlated. Above I’ve plotted growth rate in the year of IPO and the ACV bucket, grouped by $25k increments. I’ve excluded a few outliers like Veeva and Medidata which have $1M+ ACVs. Unfortunately, there’s no relationship between the value of a customer and a company’s growth rate at IPO - the data points are all over the map. This conclusion is a corollary to another analysis, The Optimal Average Customer Value for SaaS Startups , which suggested that multi-billion dollar SaaS companies can be built at any price point. Bucketing by ACV for revenue growth won’t shed much more insight into benchmarks than the raw median. Additionally, there’s no clear correlation between ACV and Sales Efficiency, as the plot above shows, so bucketing by ACV wouldn’t make sense for evaluating the go-to-market effectiveness of a SaaS company. An alternative bucketing system for benchmarking might aggregate companies generating similar revenue levels at IPO. Above, I’ve plotted the growth rates by Revenue Bucket from $0-300M in groups of $50M. Again, it’s pretty clear there is no clustering, which would indicate companies of a particular revenue size grow at different rates at IPO. There’s simply no pattern with this data. So I’m going to stick with the years since founding and a broad median to benchmark SaaS companies. Of course, my goal with the S-1 analysis of HubSpot and Box , and others in the future, as well as all the benchmarking I publish, is to help founders. If you have ideas for better ways to analyze or present the data, please send me an email or tweet with ideas. I’d love to explore them.

One of the best ways I’ve found to understand SaaS companies is to pore through their public filings. A few months ago, I analyzed Box’s S-1 . In this post, we’ll look at HubSpot’s IPO filing and compare their journey to a public company  with a basket of about 40 other publicly traded companies, in the hopes that this data will help other founders chart their path to IPO. In the next seven charts, we’ll explore how HubSpot built their business. We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I’ve used HubSpot’s colors as a consistent legend. HubSpot company data is orange, median values are black, and other company values are gray. HubSpot has achieved amazing revenue growth in their first 7 years as a company growing by more than 12x from $5.7M in 2009 revenue to 2013 revenue of $71M - an 88% CAGR. HubSpot’s revenue trajectory is effectively identical to the median publicly traded SaaS company. HubSpot’s average revenue per customer (ARPC) of about $7,752 is the fourth smallest of the companies I analyzed. HubSpot’s target customer base are SMBs and with this price point, it’s possible to support a profitable inside sales model if the team is very efficient . Only WIX, CTCT and RNG had smaller figures of $86, $265 and $352. FLTX, a maker of fleet tracking software, has identical ARPC. I’ve plotted a subset of them in the chart above. Company Founded Years to IPO Rev in $M at IPO RNG 1999 14 162 QLYS 1999 13 91 DATA 2003 10 232 FLTX 2004 10 128 CTCT 2007 9 31 HUBS 2006 8 113* WIX 2006 7 81 * estimated from the first six months of the S-1 HubSpot is the second fastest SMB SaaS company to IPO yet, achieving the mark within 8 years. Most other SMB companies, defined for this analysis as having an ARPC of less than $15,000, took at least one more year to go public. Only WIX became a public company faster, achieving the mark in 7 years. Impressively, HubSpot has been able to record much faster revenue growth than other SMB SaaS companies. I’ve estimated $113M in revenue for 2014 by extrapolating their first six months of revenue this year and applying the 2013 growth rate to it. For comparison, DATA recorded $62M in its eighth full year of business, compared to $100M+ for HubSpot. To grow at that pace, HubSpot has been investing aggressively in sales and the company is widely respected for its content marketing prowess. HubSpot’s sales efficiency, defined as the incremental annual gross margin divided by the sales, marketing and general expenses incurred in the previous year, is somewhat lower than the median SaaS company. In 2013, the company recorded a sales efficiency of 0.47, meaning about $2 of sales and marketing spend is required to generate $1 in gross profit and the payback period, the number of years before a customer’s revenue offsets the cost of customer acquisition is just over 2 years. Field 2011 2012 2013 ARPC 5,395 6,580 7,752 CAC 6,671 8,279 11,645 $ Retention Rate 71.6% 82.4% 82.9% Sales Efficiency 0.47 0.54 0.42 Payback Period (yrs) 2.2 1.9 2.4 Above, I’ve copied the unit economics data from the S-1. HubSpot has been either pursuing larger customers or has become more effective at generating more revenue from the same customer base by cross or up-selling. Average revenue per customer has increased by about 44% in the past two years. But that incremental revenue costs about 75% more in customer acquisition costs over the same period. The net effect is that HubSpot customers must pay for about 2.4 years before they become profitable on a unit basis. Given the current revenue churn rates, about 70% of customers on a dollar basis will be break-even or profitable, so the unit economics work. In the short term, the increasing costs of customer acquisition decrease net income. HubSpot must pay more to acquire a customers and as a consequence, the company’s net income in dollar terms is below that of the public SaaS median, meaning the company is burning more cash than the typical public SaaS company. But, because HubSpot generates more revenue than the typical public SaaS company in its eight year, it can afford to spend more total dollars on customer acquisition than other companies at a similar stage. On a relative basis, however, HubSpot is closer to the median up until 2012. In 2013, with the big bump in CAC, HubSpot’s net income as a percentage of revenue fell. However, only 5 companies had more negative net-income-to-revenue ratios: NetSuite, Jive, Medidata, Box and Marketo. For the moment, HubSpot is among the least profitable companies in the set, but I suspect this is because the company is investing in growth. HubSpot’s gross margin percent is rapidly improving, and tracking the median. This means that HubSpot’s cost of revenue, which for SaaS companies includes hosting costs and customer support/success expenses, is right in line with comparable companies. Last, HubSpot has historically invested more in engineering (R&D) than most SaaS companies investing more than 50% of revenues just a few years ago, but as the business has grown, HubSpot’s investment as a percentage of revenue has approached the median or about 20% of revenue. HubSpot has always been a leader in SMB customer acquisition, in particular because of their tremendous ability to acquire customers through content marketing. The HubSpot team has been able to build an explosive business, one of the fastest growing SMB SaaS companies in history with this model. The HubSpot journey to a public company provides a terrific set of benchmarks for other SMB SaaS companies. I’m excited to see how the company’s story continues to evolve.

Does a startup’s location impact its M&A prospects? We’ve already determined there is no material difference between the follow-on financing rates by geography. But do acquirers behave similarly to investors? To answer the question, I’ve prepared three charts used Crunchbase data and focused on the seven states with more than 20 acquisitions since 2010. In the first two charts, we’ll compare the share of acquisitions by state to the share of financings by state in both number and dollar value, to get a sense of relative performance by state. The third chart shows the distribution of acquisitions by state. The chart at the top of the post plots the share by state of number of acquisitions and financings. Californian startups raise 53% of the rounds in this subset of state but see 60% of the acquisitions. It’s the only state to see a higher ratio of acquisitions than financings, although the difference is slight. When looking at share by dollars, the story is a bit more skewed. Californian startup raise 49% of all the dollars among these seven states, but command 68% of the M&A dollars. NY startups see a very different pattern, raising 26% of the venture dollars and receiving 6.5% of the acquisition dollars. The Californian figures are much different than the rest of the country for a few reasons. First, a small number of very large acquisitions like WhatsApp skew the numbers. Power laws seem to govern startups and these figures are subject to that influence. Second, there is an important timing difference between the financings and acquisitions. In other words, the analysis doesn’t track whether the startups of 2010 become acquired a few years later; I’m simply adding the up the financing dollars and adding up the acquisition dollars and making a comparison. The New York startup scene has boomed in the last five or so years, but since the average time to acquisition for a startup is around seven, this latency disproportionately impacts relatively new startup states. The last and most telling chart shows the distribution of M&A outcomes by state. There is no statistically significant difference between the acquisition prices across any of these states to better than 95% confidence. In other words, like the financing market, the acquisition market is highly efficient - great companies fetch terrific prices in each of these seven states.

Earlier this week, Google celebrated the tenth anniversary of its IPO. I re-read the Founder’s IPO Letter and found this passage which captured so much about Google’s values: Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one…We will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects because of short-term earnings pressure. Some of our past bets have gone extraordinarily well, and others have not. Because we recognize the pursuit of such projects as the key to our long-term success, we will continue to seek them out. Visiting the campus for the first time in 2005, I felt different than any other workplace I had been to. So much excitement and ambition. But that feeling was more than just a product of the rocket ship growth of the ads business. Google had grown from $220k in revenue in 19aw99, to $19M in 2000, to $86M in 2001, to $347M in 2002, to $961M in 2003, and would record $3.2B in 2004, the year of their IPO. Digging past the business revealed a wonderful culture. The thing I loved most about working at Google were the values the company embraced. For as long as I can remember, Google has published its values on a page called Ten Things We Know to Be True. Some of the most visible outward signs of these values were the iconoclastic IPO process which included the the first S-1 written in plain English ; hugely ambitious projects like balloon-powered internet , self-driving cars and a glucose-measuring contact lens ; and projects to benefit others in the form of projects within Google.org like Google Flu Trends, STEM Education grants and Google Classroom. And of course, the values were much more strongly visible internally: near-total internal transparency, data-driven decision making and a deep respect for people’s beliefs and cultures. Not many companies post their values online, or even internally. But, I think that’s a mistake. Ensuring a company and its employees share a mission and a value system is becoming a more and more critical part of building enduring businesses, especially to recruit, retain and inspire employees. This is particularly true in the valley where the talent market is incredibly competitive. Ten years from now, I’m certain Google will still be a market-leading company, making bigger and bigger bets on unique technologies that both benefit their core businesses, but also benefit others. And the people pushing the business forward will be ones who share and embrace the company’s mission and values. More importantly, I hope more founders and leaders of startups will post their values publicly and use them to inspire their employees to build great, enduring and unconventional companies.

Though the term k-factor, a measure of the virality of an application, has waned in popularity since Facebook’s sheep-throwing glory days, the idea of spreading a product through referrals lives on. We all know a good referral mechanism when we see one. Dropbox’s invite-a-friend feature which awards free storage for both the inviter and the invited is the canonical example and resulted in torrid growth for the company. In April 2010, Dropbox users sent 2.8M referral emails. It’s these kinds of referrals, those that align the incentives of both parties and ones that are natural to the product, that seem to work the best. But what theory, which frameworks, can help a startup think through the rich mechanisms for creating social sharing features that feel right? I believe it’s social capital. The notion of social capital is a relatively new one. First coined by a Frenchman in the 1890s, social capital reached prominence only 100 years later when economists began to use it as a framework for understanding how people made decisions. They reasoned that it’s impossible to model human decisions’ without understanding the social fabric in which people live. The best resource I found that summarizes the current state of social capital research is a doctoral paper written by Eleonora Lollo . In that paper, the Eleonora drew the chart above which captures the 4 types of Social Capital. They are: Bonding Capital - used among family and close friends to reinforce existing, close relationships. People with these relationships respect a common hierarchy, contact each other frequently, and share common values. I think bonding capital is the hardest to create online, at least for now, because it deals with our most intimate relationships. Geni and Ancestry, services that enable users to map their family tree, demonstrate the use of bonding capital best . Bridging Capital - used among acquaintances to become closer to people. Facebook leverages bridging capital. When new acquaintances meet, they connect and they seek to increase the frequency of their interactions prim aryl through the news feed to build more mutual bridging capital and ultimately a friendship. Bridging capital knows no notion of hierarchy within a group. All friends are equal in standing. Instead it relies on homogeneity of the people interacting and increasing frequency of contact. Linking Capital - used among members of voluntary organizations including employees of the same company. Yammer and LinkedIn ask their users to expend linking capital. The hierarchy underpinning the relationships in linking capital is critical to manage, because it can alter the social dynamics quite a bit.  At Yammer, asking an employee to share the service with their boss is much more demanding than asking an employee to share with a peer. LinkedIn’s invitation mechanism has the same seniority dynamic at play. Identifying Capital - used among groups with a shared belief, most often political or idealogical. Kickstarter uses identifying capital to grow. One person creates a solution to problem, finds an audience that identifies with the problem and rallies the community to raise the capital to bring the solution to life. Some services may ask users to expend multiple types of capital. At Facebook’s outset, when it restricted friend networks within colleges, users expended bridging capital. As Facebook relaxed those constraints, the new friend behavior emerged, leading to linking capital creation. Now, Facebook can also be a place for people of similar political beliefs to congregate, a place to exchange identifying capital. At its core, creating a successful viral growth mechanism or a referral mechanism for a product means understanding the types of social capital that will be exchanged when one user invites a potential new user. The study of social capital and its applications is still relatively new and novel, but the framework described by Eleonora in her thesis is a valuable tool to design the social interactions and invitation mechanisms of all kinds of products.

Consumer companies on the whole tend to grow faster and do so will less spending on sales and marketing, and research and development than SaaS companies. The chart above shows the revenue growth rates of 60 or so recent consumer and enterprise IPOs by years since founding. Enterprise/SaaS companies in the sample achieved very small revenue in their second year and grew consistently through year 8, at which point there’s a decline. Consumer companies, on the other hand, achieve much faster growth rates. In the second year, I found four data points: Zulily, Groupon, Zynga and Millennial Media. The median revenue of those businesses in year 2 was over $100M. Simply explosive growth. And this trend continues throughout the chart with three sawtooth spikes tracing the massive growth of other consumer companies. Amazingly enough, consumer companies are able to achieve these growth rates with less R&D spend and less Sales & Marketing spend than their SaaS counterparts. The two charts above contrast the consumer and enterprise Sales & Marketing trends. In short, over the first ten years of a company’s life, consumer companies spend about 31% of revenue on sales and marketing, while SaaS companies spend 52%. The same trend is true in R&D, where consumer companies allocate 15% of their revenues compared to 22% for SaaS companies. There are likely many different causes for these large disparities. First, consumer product can be much simpler than enterprise products. Security, compliance, data compatibility are never issues consumers raise when downloading an app. But many software buyers do. Second, the sales process for enterprise products is consequently less efficient and more costly. Consequently, software companies must allocate more time and money to those sales processes. Third, enterprise products haven’t yet found a way to benefit from the tremendous distribution platforms like email, mobile app stores and social networks the way consumer companies have . Given those figures, why aren’t more of the billions VCs invest allocated to consumer companies? Today, software companies capture about 60% of all US venture dollars, and growing. Not captured in the analysis here are success rates of businesses. I wish I had some data on the success rates of consumer and enterprise startups, because we could create an expected value for a dollar invested in each category. That analysis would be worth its weight in gold.

If you’re a founder or potential founder and looking to raise seed capital, you’re entering possibly the most attractive period in a decade to start a business. A few weeks ago, we analyzed the impact of Series A and later stage VCs in the seed market. In the past four years, traditional VCs began to invest in seed-stage companies, which led to a rise in the number and size of seeds. But there’s another, more important force within the seed market: institutional seed investors. Shai Goldman collected fund raising data on these institutional seed investors’ fund raising patterns and published it over the weekend. Looking through Shai’s terrific data, I observed three trends. First, as the chart above shows, the amount of capital LPs are investing into institutional seed investors has grown by more than 3x in 4 years to about $3B in 2013. Six-months through 2014, another $3B has been invested. At this pace, seed dollars may grow by 8x compared to 2011. Second, median institutional seed fund sizes have increased by 66% to about $50M, likely driven by the great acquisition environment. Larger seed funds mean more follow-on capital for second seed rounds and throughout the lifetime of the business. Third, institutional seed funds’ share of total dollars raised has increased to about 20% of the total market through Q2 2014, which is an astounding figure. Just a few years ago, it was 5%. This is likely driven by LPs, the investors investing in VCs, who seek more diversification and access to new fund managers who can offer great returns. Consequently, there are about 150 new institutional seed funds created in the last few years. That means many more doors to knock on for founders and ultimately, a greater likelihood of raising a seed round. All in all, the seed market is one of the most fertile for founders in a long time. The amount of capital, number of institutional seed investors and sizes of these funds imply an increase in the number of seeded companies and greater follow-on capital. Thanks again to Shai for aggregating this great data and shining a light into a booming part of the market.

Earlier this week in a post on Quartz Mark DeCambre asks the question, Are IPOs Dying Because of Huge Growth Rounds? The chart above shows the 36 year trend in the number of tech IPOs. And as DeCambre points out, so far through 2014, the ten largest startup financings have yielded about twice as much capital as the ten largest IPOs. To paraphrase
Mark’s question, can startups raise just as much capital in the private markets as in the public market, without the hassle of public market regulation? Let’s look at the trends over the past decade and across all IPOs and MegaRounds to get a better sense of the trends in the number of MegaRounds and IPOs, the total amount of capital raised by startups using each mechanism and the average round size over the past decade. This larger dataset should be more representative than the top 10. Note, I’m excluding Facebook’s IPO in 2012 as an outlier and I’ve adjusted for inflation. The chart above compares the total number of MegaRounds, those VC investments of $50M or more, from 2001 through 2013. In the past four years, MegaRounds have more than doubled in number from 20 to 40, and have increased every year. Last year, there was 1 MegaRound for every 2 IPOs. In 2012, there were 3 MegaRounds for every 4 IPOs. In short, MegaRounds are increasingly common, while the number of VC-backed IPOs is relatively constant. The trend is similar in the total amount of capital raised: MegaRounds are becoming more important in the ecosystem. But MegaRounds haven’t surpassed IPOs  for total capital contribution. Over the last three years, in aggregate, startups have raised about 3x the capital in IPOs as from MegaRounds. The total number of dollars from MegaRounds is much more consistent than the relatively volatile public markets, and those dollars are growing at a 22% CAGR. Last, let’s contrast the average amount raised in a MegaRound and an IPO. In the last four years, the average MegaRound generates $94M in capital while the typical IPO raises $147M, a material 50% difference. This delta may be caused by many things. But I suspect the most important factor is startups who raise MegaRounds use these financings to delay IPO. The MegaRounds of today are the same size as the IPOs of five or ten years ago. In some sense, they have replaced those IPOs. But MegaRounds haven’t cannibalized IPOs altogether. These MegaRounds typically aren’t providing the same type of liquidity to founders and investors as a true public offering, though many of them do have substantial secondary share sale components to founders and employees. Rather, they empower startups to remain private longer and continue to grow, which enables them to command higher valuations and raise more capital at IPO. The rise of MegaRounds as a new financing tool for founders is a terrific development for founders. As the amount of capital entering venture capital has exploded, we can expect more and more of these MegaRounds and consequently, we should also see much larger IPOs than we have in the past ten years.

Yesterday, I spoke to a small group of people at Google. By coincidence, the presentation was held in the same building I used to work in, and a wave of nostalgia swept over me. Participating in Google’s speaker series brought back memories of when I was in the audience seven or eight years ago. I’ll never forget the first time I met Paul Graham in that very same room right after the first Startup School. Nor the crash-course on negotiation I took when we were negotiating with Facebook and MySpace. Nor the management class on having difficult conversations with colleagues, among countless others. Returning to Google reminded me that great companies constantly invest in their people, helping them to understand the world inside the company and outside the company. Coincidentally, in this week’s New York Times, Brian Chen writes about
the Apple’s University which teaches Apple employees about typical topics like company’s history and structure, but also delves into much more strategic concepts like effective communication and Apple’s unique design processes. So serious is Apple about their University that Jobs hired the dean from Yale’s School of Management to oversee the initiative. Chen writes about Pablo Picasso’s influence on the school. The photo above depicts Picasso’s progressive reduction when drawing a bull, starting from an intricate and muscular animal to a sketch of only seven lines. It’s one of many tools used to teach Apple’s design ethos. As Chen points out, Picasso’s progression is echoed in the evolution of Apple’s mouse, which started as a ten-sided brick with a button, today is a single piece of curved plastic . Apple University is a competitive advantage. Apple commands 6x the operating margin of its competitors because of its design and marketing prowess. After leaving Google, I discovered startups are more open and collaborative with their learning than most large companies. At conferences, events and coffee meetings, startup founders and employees freely share many of the insights into product design, marketing, customer success, and engineering best practices. One could argue the entire open-source movement is a giant continuing education program for software engineers. This fast-paced knowledge sharing is a key part of what makes Silicon Valley such a hotbed of innovation. It’s wonderful that massively profitable, public companies can make these investments. But, how should founders incorporate these ideas into their startups? Most early stage startups can’t afford the expense in time or capital to create education programs. But they can fund continuing employee education on a smaller scale the form of sales training, marketing workshops, guest speakers, management coaching. In the current recruiting environment, I expect this type of perk is be a strong selling point to prospective employees and a powerful retention tool. I think most people who have been through similar program will attest, it’s an amazing feeling when your company and manager invests in your personal success in this way. The loyalty engendered is hard to overstate. As a startup grows and scales, it’s easy to forget about deepening employee education. But the enrichment both in knowledge and network building is invaluable. Furthermore, it’s a terrific investment in the business’ competitive advantage, its people.

When I started in the venture business and met software companies, I never heard the words customer success during pitches or throughout diligence or in board meetings. A few years later, customer success has become equal in importance to sales and marketing and engineering and product within SaaS companies. The steady increasing drumbeat of the Customer Success mantra is reflected in Google search traffic, whose volumes have tripled since 2009 . So, why now? I’ve been fortunate to meet two experts from McKinsey’s SaaS practice: Monica Adractas who is now head of customer retention at Box and Brian Stafford, a partner. They explained to me customer success is a decades-old discipline. For example, banks and telecom companies have mastered the practice of customer success over the past 20 or 30 years. Both of these industries are characterized by commodity goods, slow growth in the absolute size of the market and intense competition. Stealing share from competitors is the only way to grow. Not surprisingly, best-in-class customer success becomes a key differentiator. But, the SaaS world isn’t marked by any of the characteristics of the banking and telecom sectors. SaaS spending is $18B and growing at about 20% per year . While competition exists in certain segments, SaaS penetration is just a few percentage points of the total software market, according to our internal analysis. As Brian and Monica explained to me, SaaS startups are discovering the importance of customer success because of two important properties intrinsic to SaaS companies: the sales process and the delivery model. In traditional enterprise sales, the salesperson sold the customer a product once for a perpetual license and committed the customer to pay an annual service fee, often 15-25% of the price of the software. Companies like Tableau and QlikTech among others pursue a similar model in which customers pay for their own customer success. In contrast, SaaS businesses face renewal sales processes constantly. Each time a customer sees the monthly or quarterly or annual subscription payment, they wonder, should I be paying for this? Renewal conversations occur with much greater frequency than with perpetual software sales. Startups that manage customer renewals better than their peers grow faster and require less capital . Additionally, the buyer is now much closer to the end user. Unlike the enterprise sale to the head of IT, where software is pushed down from the top, SaaS companies take advantage of the consumerization of IT . Positive and negative feedback about the product flow much more freely and quickly to the buyer, accelerating both purchasing and churn decisions. Consequently, maintaining customers requires a nimble customer success team. Last, the as-a-Service delivery model empowers a SaaS company to initially develop a Minimum Viable Product, and iterate and improve the product over time. To ensure customers maximize the value from a constantly evolving product, a startup must provide on-going training and persistent education in order to achieve engagement and true product/market fit . Often, these conversations provide the customer success team with valuable product feedback to share with the product team. SaaS is transforming enterprise software. SaaS products evolve faster, are cheaper to operate and are closer to the end user than enterprise software has ever been. But to achieve their true potential, SaaS startups must master Customer Success and help customers understand how to master these new tools. Advances in the sales/renewal process and the product delivery demand it. Read more about customer success here

More than 100B mobile applications have been downloaded since the launch of the Apple iOS and Google Play stores. As the number of users, downloads and apps have exploded, the dynamics of the app store have also changed. During the past 18 months, the competitive behavior within the Free Apps section of these app stores has evolved substantially in four meaningful ways: First, the Android Play store has become substantially more welcoming to startups/new entrants than 18 months ago. The chart above compares the competition in the Play store in early 2013 and in mid-2014. On the x-axis, I’ve plotted plots the rank volatility[1], how much a typical app moves in ranking in 30 days on the x-axis. On the y-axis, the chart shows the percent of applications that exhibit that volatility. I’m using rank volatility as a proxy for competitiveness: more changes in rankings in the app store implies more competition and a more efficient marketplace, which should help the best apps rise to the top, even if they are new to the app store. In 2013, apps most frequently moved only 1-2 slots, meaning if an app became #1, it was very difficult to displace. In mid-2014, apps’ rank volatility is far more uniformly distributed, meaning mobile apps are moving up and down all the time, implying strong competition and a vibrant market. Second, the iOS store has also become more competitive. In 2013, many apps controlled their rank, and observed rank volatilties of less than five slots. Today, the fraction of those controlling applications has fallen by 80%.  However, unlike the Play store which exhibits a relatively uniform distribution of rank volatility, meaning a roughly equal numbe of apps move 3 slots and some move 75 slots, apps in the iOS store tend not to see swings of 50 or more very frequently. Just like in 2013, today 75% of iOS apps see a volatility of less than 50. Third, the typical app in 2014 swings 10-30 ranks per month compared to 1-5 ranks eighteen months ago. There’s much more jockeying for position. The counterpoint to a greater ease to reach the top 10 or top 50 is that it’s easier to fall as well. This data implies startups must be much more attentive to their app rankings. Staying at the peak of the charts demands more sophisticated organic and paid acquisition strategies, but more importantly, developing differentiated products. Fourth, competition varies by category in both stores. The chart above shows the iOS store and the chart below, the Play store, with the volatility broken down by app category. The concentrated spike in Social Networking indicates very small app rank volatility (the top spots are hard to unseat). Contrast that shape with the statistical mesa of Weather. These differences aren’t surprising. Social Networks tend to create power laws with their user bases - the big become bigger - and this behavior is echoed in the charts. On the other hand, Weather apps, which rebroadcast the same weather data, see much greater movements in app ranks as new and better products are released. The story with Google Play is similar below. During the past 18 months, all the metrics for app stores have grown dramatically especially the number of users and the download counts. The size of the audience for mobile apps presents an even more compelling distribution opportunity for startups to acquire users. In addition, the increasing efficiency of mobile app marketplaces means very few apps are unassailable. The successes of mobile-first social networks like Instagram and SnapChat, despite Facebook’s dominant position in social networking, are concrete examples of this trend. Because of the greater efficiency of these marketplaces, the best apps will rapidly rise to the top and others will quickly fall out of favor. In short, it’s a great time to be a mobile startup with a differentiated product. [1] I’m using the standard deviation of the ranks to create this volatility metric.

When starting a company, founders often decide between two structures: the S-Corp and the LLC. But, as James Surowiecki writes in “ Companies with Benefits, ” there is a new option called the B-Corporation, the Benefit Corporation. The Benefit Corporation became an option in 2010 when Maryland’s legislature signed it into law. Subsequently, nearly twenty states have followed suit including California and Delaware. In the past four years, more than 1,000 companies have become B-Corporations including some very well known brands in technology and consumer goods: Warby Parker, Patagonia, Seventh Generation, Method Soaps, Etsy, New Belgium Brewery, Ben & Jerry’s, among others. In addition to maximizing shareholder value, the goal of nearly all corporations, Benefit Corporations strive to impact society and the environment in a positive way.  The charter of a B-Corp dictates the board of directors must consider the best interests of the corporation and the effects of its decisions on the company’s workforce, its customers, community and societal factors, and the environment. While many S-Corps, C-Corps and LLCs commit to social missions, the vigor with which they pursue these missions can wane. Additionally, there is no process or standard by which to judge the company’s progress. In contrast, B-Corporations cannot waver. B-Corps must elect a Benefits Director who is responsible for ensuring the social mission of the company is balanced with the financial mission. The Benefit Director must solicit an annual audit performed by a third-party. If the board fails to direct the company properly, shareholders of a B-Corporation can sue the company. I like the idea of committing to a set of important values in the company charter, particularly for mission driven companies. Because I wasn’t familiar with B-Corps before reading Surowiecki’s post and because I haven’t worked with a B-Corp, I don’t yet know the intricacies of the structure or the challenges that may arise from it. If you’re considering a B-Corp, I suggest consulting an attorney to understand the implications in more depth. But on the surface, the B-Corp structure seems to be a powerful way for founders to irrevocably imbue a company with a social mission. Because new directors, who may be investors or independents, must adhere to the charter, the B-Corp ensures the core company values, the same ones a business was founded to promote, become a permanent fixture of the way the company does business.

For consumer products, the power of mobile distribution is hard to overstate. Facebook serves more than 1B mobile users each month. Angry Birds reached 50M users in 35 days , a feat that took Instagram 18 months and Facebook more than 3 years. But the distribution advantages of mobile app stores hasn’t been observed as powerfully in SaaS or enterprise software for driving revenue. The majority of the top 20 slots of the Business Apps Category in the iTunes store aren’t occupied by startups. Nor has the story of a 3 year-to-10M user story been written about an enterprise application, yet. The difference between consumer and the SaaS startups’ effectiveness leveraging mobile app store distribution hinges on the end user. In the case of consumer companies, the end user is the buyer. In SaaS, the end user is very infrequently the buyer. This is why mobile SaaS companies must employ a two-step value proposition , first convincing the end user to download and use the app, and second, using this data to initiate a sales process with the decision-maker within the enterprise. This second step, at least to date, has been the limiting factor in using mobile-app distribution to drive SaaS company growth. However, SaaS mobile usage patterns are certainly following the lead of their consumer counterparts. It’s not uncommon for many SaaS startups with mobile apps to see 30-50%+ of their usage on mobile, a figure now common in ecommerce and other consumer categories. There’s no question that mobile has impacted SaaS companies’ businesses. At the very least, SaaS companies must build a mobile application to maximize engagement with their userbase. Perhaps in the near future, an innovative startup will find a way to target both the end user and the enterprise decision maker through the mobile store. Until then, mobile app stores will remain great end-user acquisition channels, but won’t replace the inside-sales process to close customers.

Through last week, 80% of fast-growing technology companies who reported Q2 earnings had met or exceeded expectations, on average by 4%. As the earnings season has progressed , the tech sector is showing impressive signs of strength and predictability in the underlying companies’ business. Startups benefit from a booming public market for three reasons. First, strong earnings buoy public technology share prices which drives M&A. The chart above shows the relationship between beating earnings and Enterprise Value to Trailing-Twelve Month Revenue Multiple (EV/TTM Rev). The correlation exceeds 0.53, indicating a moderately strong connection. As a consequence of higher stock prices, stock increases in value and cash becomes easier to raise and relatively less expensive, both of which entice tech publics to acquire startups, extending the current vibrant M&A market. Second, the valuation multiples commanded by public companies cascade to some extent to the private markets, first to the later stage businesses raising pre-IPO rounds, and eventually to the earlier stage markets. After the correction of about 40% enterprise companies and of 25% in consumer names , the median enterprise revenue multiple has popped back up 7.4x from 5.2x and consumer has increased similarly to 7.0x. Anecdotally, I haven’t seen much of a decline in early stage startup valuations after the February correction in the public markets. And the recent increase in multiples implies there is no deflationary pressure on startup valuations from the public markets. Third, the relative predictability consumer and enterprise publics indicates a relative fertile environment for startups to sell into. Advertising-driven models, SaaS business models, consumer hardware and marketplaces are all represented in the earnings figures so far. There are some EPS negative outliers, most notably Amazon. But Amazon’s  massive EPS miss has more to do with large scale capital investment in AWS than a lack of a profitable business or customer base. Below are the updated Revenue Surprise and Earnings per Share Surprise charts for the tech companies in the consumer and enterprise baskets I’ve been tracking. This represents about half of the companies in those baskets, but at this point, should provide a pretty representative view of the state of public technology companies. Overall, business is go, go go for technology companies despite the blip earlier this year in the stock market. And as the public companies exceed expectations, they will be pulling startups up with them.

I’ve listened to thousands of fundraising pitches in my six years so far at Redpoint. Some with demos, some without. Some with hockey-stick charts, and others just an idea. I’ll never forget one meeting when the founders presented an entirely hand-drawn deck on 12 pieces of paper.  The extent of founders’ creativity is hard to over-state. Most founders do cover the essentials of a pitch in their presentations . But what distinguishes the best pitches? It’s a question I hear all the time from founders looking to polish their pitch. In addition to assuaging the 11 Risks VCs Evaluate , the best fundraising pitches convince prospective investors of inevitability. The most successful pitches argue the market will unfold inexorably in the way the founders envision on a relevant time scale. And, that this startup in particular will dominate share in that new world. There is no prescriptive way I can recommend to consistently argue inevitability. Some founders use data. Others use logic. Still others use emotion and passion to do it. But in the end, these exceptional storytellers make you want to believe, suspend doubt, and disregard the great risks that all startups face all along their journey, and get involved with the business. The best resource I’ve found for understanding the techniques of great storytellers is Nancy Duarte’s book, Resonate . It’s the only book that explains the cadence and structure of great storytellers, comparing and contrasting Steve Jobs’ style with Richard Feynman’s and many others. There is a craft to creating a pitch that conveys inevitability. It takes time and thought and effort. But, investing the time to sculpt that story is well worth the work. The story will yield dividends during every investor meeting, press conference and candidate interview.

Customer Success is a relatively new discipline in the Software-as-a-Service world. Consequently, there are many unanswered questions about how best to build and manage great Customer Success teams for SaaS companies. Because the financial impact of a great CS team is compounded monthly and can meaningfully increase the growth and decrease the cash needs of SaaS startups, it’s critical for CS leaders to get it right. Last night, I attended a dinner with many heads of Customer Success from prominent valley SaaS companies. We spoke for quite a while about the best way to structure and motivate Customer Success teams to balance customer care and account growth. One VP of Customer Success described an innovative approach to managing this balancing act. The diagram above entitled the “Performance CSM Sales Motion” captures her team’s sales motion. First, the sales team engages and signs either a pilot or full contract with a customer. Second, an account manager, tiered by customer size, engages that customer through the initial deployment. As time passes and the customer’s usage of the product grows, a third person becomes involved: the up-salesperson. Around the time of the customer’s renewal period, the up-salesperson begins a new sales process to grow the account, and the account manager disengages during that process. Ideally, the up-selling process is successful and then, the motion repeats. The account manager ensures a happy and successful customer and the up-salesperson intervenes again when product usage spikes and during renewal times. If not, the account manager picks up the account and the up-sales process is tried again later. To enable this type of sales motion, this VP of Customer Success structured her team differently than most Customer Success organizations I’ve seen. Traditional Customer Success Management, depicted above, has the quota-carrying salesperson transferring a post-sales customer to a non-quota carrying customer success manager, who is responsible for account management ad account growth. Some companies do create a small up-sell quota for the CSM, perhaps 10-15% of their compensation. But many do not. The Performance CSM model adds a third person belonging to a third team, the Up-Salesperson on the Up-Sales team. The Up Sales Person carries a quota and is compensated with a sales structure, while the CS Manager is salaried. By splitting the responsibility of customer care/happiness from up-selling responsibility, this VP of Customer Success has been able to build a team that both satisfies customers and grows accounts effectively. Also, the Up-Sales team is structured and managed in an identical way to the Sales and the CS team, which could be by region or by product/solution or customer account value. This is important because it builds strong relationships across departments, since the same Sales, Up-Sales and CS members work together and provides a consistent experience for customers. As the number of SaaS companies increases, and their sophistication in serving customers deepens, I expect to see refinement of the Customer Success model. Today, there aren’t many wide-spread best practices. But techniques like the Performance CSM model are big steps in that direction.

One of the most important changes is the workplace in the last 20 years is the notion that most employees are free agents. We are hired and fired and resign at will. It’s a markedly different era than the career salarymen of IBM’s heyday who remained with the company for decades from college graduation through retirement. In this highly-competitive talent market, where every employee is a free agent, hiring and retaining talent has become a key strategic advantage. So, which are the best tools to create a vibrant and attractive working environment? I’m sure this is a question on every founder and CEO’s mind. In The Alliance , Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh describe the talent management strategies which succeeded at LinkedIn. In particular, they adopt a metaphor coined by VP of Product David Hahn during his nine years at LinkedIn: the Tour of Duty. A Tour of Duty has a defined mission, clear objectives, and a bounded time frame. The book describes three different types of Tours of Duty: Rotational Tours : rotational tours cycle an employee through a few different departments over the course of several years. The employee benefits from a breadth of learning and exposure to different teams, and the employer tests longer-term fit across different departments. Several companies have management rotation programs. Some of the best known ones including GE’s Early Career Leadership Program and Google’s APM program , among many others. Transformational Tours : transformational tours are bounded by individual progression and are typically negotiated by manager and employee with the aim of transforming the employee into someone who can meaningfully change the trajectory of the business. They are often longer in duration than rotational tours. Foundational Tours : a smaller group of people will be able to embark on foundational tours, which the book defines as exceptional alignment of employee and employer. Jony Ive at Apple. Jeff Weiner at LinkedIn. Eric Schmidt at Google. These there employees joined a company and transformed it by melding their vision with the company’s. Foundational tours can last decades. Achieving success in a of Tours of Duty demands a similar process to most well designed projects. First, a shared sense of mission and values between employer and employee must be established. Second, the company must take the time to understand the short and long term career aspirations of the employee, and craft a tour of duty with relevant daily work that will help the employee achieve those goals. Third, employers and employees must define success criteria for the Tour of Duty. Fourth, employer and manager should provide each other feedback on progress throughout. Finally, the next tour of duty must begin to be defined before the current one is completed. I wasn’t familiar with it before reading The Alliance, but I really like the idea of a Tour of Duty. It aligns the mission and work of an employee with a business, and ensures both are benefitting from the relationship. In order to attract and retain the best talent, startups have to create a culture of trust, respect, learning, accomplishment and shared values/mission. The Tour of Duty concept is a framework to help companies foster that culture.

I’ve never paid much attention to earnings reports in the past. But as I’ve been analyzing the tech industry more and more, and the stock market has begun to surpass record highs , I’ve been wondering whether the persistent bull market in tech is healthy. Or at the very least, whether the companies pushing the industry forward are able to understand the environment and their businesses well enough to meet the commitments they make to public market investors. To get a better sense of this, I’ve charted the Revenue and EPS (earnings-per-share) figures for two baskets of public technology companies, a consumer and an enterprise basket. Through the end of last week, about 25% of the public tech companies in these baskets had reported earnings for Q2 2014. I intend to update these charts each week or so, as more companies report to refine the analysis. The chart above shows Revenue Surprise, which is the difference between the revenue reported by the company and the expectations of analysts. Analysts expectations are guided by the company during previous earnings announcements. The theory goes that a well-managed publicly traded company should be able to hit its revenue plan. A company that guides investors to a certain revenue and earnings target and meaningfully misses its target should be concerning. So a positive or zero surprise is a good thing. If many tech companies begin to miss targets, it might be a sign of tougher times ahead. So far in Q2 ‘14, fourteen of the twenty companies exceeded revenue expectations. Yahoo has been the worst miss to date with a 4% miss, but on the whole, the companies who have reported to date seem to be hitting their plans. Looking at Earnings-Per-Share (EPS), half of the companies exceeded their guidance. Amazon is the notable case, missing its target by more than 100% because of greater costs in their core business and significant investments in new businesses like the Fire phone. Aside from Amazon’s outlier, the rest of the field seems to be evenly divided with similar variances. It seems the majority of EPS misses to date are are consumer companies: Amazon, Angie’s List, Google, GrubHub, Pandora and Yahoo. Looking at the data by industry, the initial data shows that on the whole, enterprise companies have been outperforming their earnings targets by 25% (median), compared to 0% for consumer. This could be an indication of unanticipated strength in the enterprise market or greater predictability of those businesses, but it’s worth more research to determine if that’s truly the case. So far, the public technology companies that have reported earnings seem to be able to achieve their targets, with a handful of negative earnings outliers. I’m curious to see how the rest of the earnings season unfolds.

“Advice is one person’s experience generalized”, an entrepreneur told me once. “It’s a single point of view with all kinds of survivorship and attribution bias. Advice can be a terribly dangerous thing, because it can be used as a shortcut for thinking.” When I asked how he responded to requests for advice, because as a successful entrepreneur he was often solicited for it, he replied that he first shared the structure and the framework he used to look at the problem. Only after discussing that, did he reveal the details about he and his team had arrived at a decision. Each time someone asks for advice, I remember that conversation and the wisdom that entrepreneur shared with me. And I wonder whether what I’m about to say is as helpful as the little piece of paper tucked into a fortune cookie, an out-of-context recommendation, that can be easily misinterpreted. When I reflect on the best advice I’ve received in my life, it has never been the counsel that provided an immediate point-of-view on an answer. Rather, it was the guidance that started as a single probing question that I couldn’t answer immediately, a question that invited me to look upon the puzzle with a new perspective and demanded deeper thought. A little Buddhist Koan. I suppose that’s why I gravitate to frameworks and data when I write. Both are starting points for a series of questions about what is similar and unique in different cases; what applies and what doesn’t. This process of comparing and contrasting, of testing and defeating assumptions, that’s what leads to insight. By accepting advice at face value, we simply copy someone else’s answer, which is just as valuable as following the recommendation of a fortune cookie. When someone next asks you for advice, I challenge you to take a moment and think about the right question to ask or the right framework to frame the problem, rather than the best recommendation to make. It might be the best advice you’ve ever given.

How much is my business worth? It’s a question every entrepreneur, founder and business owner asks themselves. This is particularly true during acquisition conversations with a prospective buyer. Because most companies are privately held, the acquisition details of the roughly 10,000 businesses who sell themselves for less than $500M each year in the US remain hidden. There are enormous forces at play in the M&A market that indicate M&A activity will increase substantially in the next few years. Consequently, every business leader ought to develop and maintain a good understanding of their business’ market value. As the data in the chart above shows, the amount of capital held by large public companies has roughly doubled from $675B to $1.2T in 5 years, a burgeoning war-chest that will fuel increasing M&A activity for years to come. In addition to an abundance of public company capital for acquisitions, private equity firms have amassed a 10 year high of $412B in dry powder, more capital for M&A. Two years ago, we invested in Axial, a company which has capitalized on these trends and has since become the largest market place in the US for M&A transactions, with more than 200 businesses joining the platform each week. Today, Axial released a valuation tool to help CEOs all over the US estimate the value of their business. Axial’s Valuation Tool uses discounted cash flow analysis and collects a few bits of information about a company to provide a Zillow-like Zestimate of a company’s value. Because the DCF model uses profitability as a core variable, the estimator won’t work for many startups whose main concern is growth. But for the millions of businesses in the US which do generate a profit, Axial’s Valuation Tool works very well. In addition to helping business owners understand the value of their business, Axial connects business owners with acquirers, lenders and investors, providing entrepreneurs clarity in a traditionally opaque market. Last, the company provides advice and guidance on how to start and manage M&A processes. The Internet has a unique ability to create more efficient market places and networks. We’ve seen it with classifieds and collectibles, real estate and resumes. Axial’s ambition is to do the same with in the $200B annual M&A market , by helping founders and CEOs maximize the value of their companies.

Through the first six months of 2014, VCs have raised about as much as all of 2013 . If this pace of fund raising continues, 2014 would mark the biggest year for VCs since 2001, when the industry raised about $38B . This new money hasn’t yet hit the startup fundraising market in earnest, as the chart above shows. The second quarter of 2014 is the sixteenth largest by capital deployed sinced 1995, making it a top quartile quarter, but to break into the top five, that figure would need to triple. Nevertheless, we will see a spike in the next six months as firms begin investing from new funds. Which startup sectors should expect to benefit from this surfeit of capital? ![image]( https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/share_of_dollars_by_sector.png " width=100%/> Each quarter, the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Reuters gather data on the VC industry. I’ve used this data to draw the long term investment trends across the US venture capital industry. The chart above depicts the VC sector investment trends within this data and compares the share of VC dollars raised by entrepreneurs in particular sectors each quarter. Consumer startups have been raising between 15-20% of dollars for the past few years and that share seems to be on the rise. But make no mistake; software investments are the real story. VCs have doubled their allocations to software compared to five years ago. This shift to software has been at the expense of Infrastructure investments which saw their heyday in the 2000 era when the nervous system of the internet was built and scaled. Health startups have garnered a persistent share of about 20% of dollars. Meanwhile, Energy investment has collapsed, plagued by capital intensive projects with very long success horizons. ![image]( https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/share_of_investment_dollars_by_stage.png " width=100%/> Which rounds should become easier to raise? The NVCA’s data on share of investment dollars by stage is plotted above. Keep in mind, the total number of investments has remained relatively constant at roughly 350 per quarter over the past few years . In that relatively calm environment, there has been a marked shift to Early Stage/Series As investments on a dollars and number basis, at the expense of Expansion Stage/Series Bs. Later Stage/Growth Investments seem to be relatively constant. It’s hard to predict whether the doubling of dollars into VC bank account will translate into a consistent pattern of investment both by stage. Some of the funds raised may be dedicated to a particular stage for example, and will skew the results in the future. But if past trends are any indication and with twice the capital entering the market in 2014,  the market for early stage software and consumer investments should be quite strong over the next 12-18 months, provided the public market remains steady.

In 2008, when I started working at Redpoint I knew very little about how the venture business worked, and before I started at the firm, I wanted to prepare by learning as much as I could about the industry. Unfortunately, not much was written about venture capital at the time. In fact, I found only two books: a textbook on private equity and venture capital by HBS professor Joshua Lerner, and an out-of-print collection of 32 VC interviews called “ Done Deals ,” published in September 2000. I bought a second-hand copy on Amazon and read it cover to cover. This past weekend, I opened Done Deals again for the first time since I started at Redpoint, some six years later. It was surreal to read the interviews again because some of the quotes, particularly the ones about competition aptly describe today’s environment. And other statements are pure anachronisms. I’ve copied my favorites below. Bob Kagle, Benchmark I was at TVI for 12 years. In early 1995 we decided, as a group, not to raise another fund together. It was a collective decision in which we, in some sense, decided to declare victory, because the partnership had been tremendously successful…I think at one point in time we had 25 companies each with a $250M market cap. Corrected for inflation, the $250M in market cap is about $375M in 2014 dollars. While those 25 companies’ valuations may still not seem that enormous in today’s environment, the key difference is fund size. TVI’s funds were much smaller that the multi-hundred million dollar funds typical of institutional investors today. Louis Borders of Borders Books is launching a company by the name of Web Van. If you think of groceries and drugs and general merchandise that are brought to your door in two hours, you’ll have the idea. ..It’s a business when Web orders is an absolutely pivotal enabling technology. It’s like deja vu all over again with the number of local delivery companies. The only difference is today, we might replace the word Web with mobile. Ann Winblad, Hummer Winblad In the early 90’s, we took companies public only if they had four or five quarters of profit, with 20% growth per quarter in revenue and earnings. Several of our companies were the first in the 1990s with billion dollar market caps. What a difference 15 years make. Most of today’s IPOs are substantially larger and more sophisticated companies larger than in the late 90s. The typical 90s venture backed IPO generated $20M in trailing twelve months’ revenue compared to the roughly $75-$100M today. One key difference is in the public markets which seem to prefer management teams to operate their businesses with negative net income to grow faster. By mid-1999, $300M was being invested in Internet companies each week. Just to put this in comparison to the beginning of the dot-com bubble, in Q2 2014, VCs invested $208M per week in internet companies. By my estimates, VCs are investing less than 1/3 of of the roughly $100B deployed in 2000. Mitch Kapor, Accel The business plan that Sevin Rosen had invested in projected first-year revenues of $8 to $10M. My first plan was $3M to $4M, but I raised the estimates. We actually did $53M in revenue in the first year. In 1983 dollars! And then we tripled that in ‘84. Mitch Kapor founded Lotus. Reading through the book now, I have a much greater appreciation for the rate of revenue growth Lotus at launch. I don’t know of any company since that has achieved that growth rate or first year revenues. Don Valentine, Sequoia A lot has changed in the venture business since we first began. The nature of deal-making has changed, as has pricing. People are willing to pay higher prices because they feel that the public markets and company buyers are willing to pay more. The business is much more competitive, and people are constantly bidding against each other. Just as true now as back then. John Doerr By 1990, Intuit had one million happy customers and revenues of $33M. Then Scott [Cook] decided it was time to take Intuit to the next level…KP invested $4.7M for 12% of Intuit… our $4.7M never went to the company’s bank account, but purchased shares directly from the company’s founders. The terms at which a software company raised capital back then were completely different. Intuit would generate $122M three years later, growing at least 90% per year, with $14M in net income. The company raised $5M at $40M post, or just about 1x revenues, compared to today’s SaaS companies which trade at 6-10x revenues Reid Dennis, IVP In 1952 to 1953, I was the only person working in the financial district of San Francisco who was trained as an electrical engineer. Learning about the industry through the words of the investors who have seen it through decades is fascinating. Today, there’s much more written about the industry: more statistics, more bloggers, more books. And that collective history will only serve to benefit entrepreneurs and investors alike.

Last week, Twitter released a feature enabling users to download organic tweet data . Naturally, I put my data through its paces to see if I could find any best practices for this blog. Below are the conclusions, which are tested to 95% confidence. I’ve also linked below to the code for recreating this analysis for your audience. Engagement rate, defined by Twitter as clicks, highlights, and favorites of a tweet is relatively constant throughout the day. But impressions, the total number of views of a particular Tweet, spike right at the beginning of the workday, from 8-11 and then at the end of the workday, from 3-5. Not surprisingly, retweets, which drive impressions and reach, are most common from 8-10 and from 4-5. Readers are most likely to click on an embedded link in the morning. 6am just as successful as 8-10am. Amazingly, Twitter user behavior, at least for my content, has no statistically significant difference by day of week. The length of the tweet has no impact on engagement. The average tweet reaches at best 19% of my followers, implying tweet recirculation is important . In summary, the best time for me to tweet is between 8-10 am every day and then from 3-5pm. I’m going to change my Buffer schedule to reflect this data. I’m also going to recirculate Tweets more aggressively. For those seeking more detail, I’ve posted the five most interesting charts from the analysis below. Bars in red are better than the bars in blue with 95% confidence. In case you’re curious to understand your own Twitter audience behavior, the R code to replicate this analysis is found here .

Vik Singh wrote a great post in VentureBeat last week titled “ Why Salesforce Needed to Buy RelateIQ ” in which he talks about a new era in SaaS, the Predictive Era, the era of intelligent software. We’ve just seen one of the first acquisitions in the category with RelateIQ*, but I believe we will see many, many more for a few reasons. First and most importantly, prediction provides competitive differentiation in an increasingly competitive market. It’s no longer sufficient in most horizontal SaaS categories to provide a cloud-based alternative with similar features to traditional software incumbents. RelateIQ showed this to some extent in CRM. The company uses natural language processing to reduce data entry. But this trend is as true for email marketing tools as logs analysis, for calendars as lead prioritization tools. This differentiation is made possible because tens of thousands of customers already store the data required to feed machine learning algorithms in the cloud. As a result, predictive SaaS companies can easily access this data. For example, Vik’s company, Infer*, uses a customer’s Salesforce data, among other data sets, to predict which leads will convert to help sales teams prioritize their time. By prioritizing sales leads better, Infer doubles the effectiveness of the sales team. Third, machine learning is becoming an increasingly available skill set in the job market and the predictive ability of predictive models is improving. Last, the costs to build models has plummeted as cloud infrastructure costs have fallen . Amazingly, Amazon has reduced prices 42 times in the past few years. Predictive SaaS companies will face a few challenges as they go to market. First, these companies must rise above the noise of the market. Many companies promise prediction and learning, but few truly deliver it. This is key to winning customers at scale from incumbent players. Second, predictive technologies work better with larger data sets. This typically means predictive SaaS companies should focus on mid-market/large customers and/or teams within businesses that generate large amounts of data. Last, the company has to create a machine learning team. I’m really excited by the potential of prediction in SaaS. My partners and I at Redpoint have been actively investing in predictive SaaS and are proud to back RelateIQ, Infer, and Refresh among others. Particularly in the broad horizontal SaaS categories, prediction will be one of the key differentiating factors for SaaS in the next five years. (*) Denotes a Redpoint company

Listening is hard, as my friend once said, because you run the risk of having to change the way you see the world. That line stopped me cold when I was reading In the Light of What We Know because it’s so true. To set aside the way we’ve thought about an idea in the past and consider it as if it were a totally new concept is what a Buddhist might call Beginner’s Mind . It means taking the time to reflect and consider new perspectives. Consequently, listening is one of the greatest opportunities to learn. Because truly innovative companies create something new, they often change the way an industry works. This means many of the old ways of doing things have to be redefined, and learned; and this learning often must take place very quickly for the company to survive, particularly in competitive markets. Listening to customers and colleagues is often one the most important tools for learning and developing those new processes. Even the strongest willed leaders do it. Ed Catmull is a co-founder of Pixar, arguably one of the most creative institutions on the planet, having developed many of the most loved digital characters in recent memory, like Buzz Lightyear. Pixar’s movies have grossed more than $7B , and the average film grosses more than half a billion on a $120M investment - simply an amazing batting average. Catmull has written a book on creativity and in it, he shares a surprising story about working with Steve Jobs. “In all the 26 years with Steve, Steve and I never had one of these loud verbal arguments and it’s not my nature to do that. …  but we did disagree fairly frequently about things. … I would say something to him and he would immediately shoot it down because he could think faster than I could. … I would then wait a week … I’d call him up and I give my counter argument to what he had said and he’d immediately shoot it down. So I had to wait another week, and sometimes this went on for months. But in the end one of three things happened. About a third of the time he said, ‘Oh, I get it, you’re right.’ And that was the end of it. And it was another third of the time in which [I’d] say, ‘Actually I think he is right.’ The other third of the time, where we didn’t reach consensus, he just let me do it my way, never said anything more about it.” Business Insider article on Creativity, Inc. , a book by Pixar’s CEO Being open-minded to a change in the way we see the world is at the heart of listening, and ultimately learning. It’s one of the core skill sets of great companies because it provides them the capacity to be nimble and evolve as these companies shape and redefine their markets.

See an updated version of this post: Trends in the Startup Acquisition Market in 2015 The venture-backed startup IPO market has remained strong over the past five quarters, with 20 or more IPOs in each of those quarters . I was curious how the strength of the IPO market has impacted the acquisition market. In particular, how the number and value of startup acquisitions has changed, and more specifically, whether there are any trends in the sizes of acquisitions. To get a better sense of these trends, I’ve analyzed the Crunchbase acquisition data for US tech companies over the last 4.5 years. Looking only at disclosed acquisitions, I bucketed the past four years’ worth of acquisition by size: from $0-50M, $50-100M, $100M-500M and $500M+ and graphed the trends across those buckets. If you’re curious, the share of disclosed vs non-disclosed acquisitions has remained relatively constant over this period at about 80% of transaction values not disclosed. The chart at the top of the post shows the number of acquisitions remained relatively stable through 2012. But in 2013, activity increased across the board, and in the case of greater than $500M transactions, the number doubled. Six months into 2014, the number of the largest acquisitions (32) already exceeds figures from 2010-2012 (average of 18), indicating the trend of a growing number of large acquisitions is continuing. As the total number of large acquisitions has increased, so has the average and median value of the largest acquisitions. In 2014, the average large acquisition totaled $6.6B and the median reached $1.7B. The median is 50% greater than the previous four years. In other words, the big are getting bigger. I suspect the cause is the rise of growth capital, the delay of startup IPOs and consequently, the substantially larger size of the largest acquisition targets. Aside from >500M bucket, the typical value of an acquisition has remained relatively constant. The startup M&A market is healthy and stable in the sub-$500m range, and the M&A activity in the largest segments is vigorous and increasing, moving very much in stride with the IPO market.

It would seem hardware startups are booming. First, the amazing success of the GoPro business and IPO , which set a 23-year high-water mark for a consumer hardware company. Second, there seems to be a growing number of hardware startups bubbling in incubators like Lemnos Labs and Highway1 . Third,  Kickstarter and other crowdfunding sites have enabled hardware startups to mitigate one of the biggest risks in starting out: obtaining a reliable proxy for consumer demand. But do the data support the idea that the hardware ecosystem is as vibrant as it seems? The chart above shows the sizes and frequency of hardware investment in the US since 2010 across different investment stages (Series A, B, C and Seed), using Crunchbase data. Each investment is a red circle.  Each plot also shows a linear trend line for round sizes in gray. The most salient data point from the chart is the sudden increase in the sizes of hardware seed rounds in the past 24 month or so. Before 2013, there were very few hardware seed rounds exceeding $1M, but in 2013, 56% of seed stage hardware companies that raised rounds, raised more than $1M. Other segments of the market, namely Series A, B and C, have kept their typical investment size relatively constant. The bar chart above shows the investment pace by year by Series. Note, the 2014 data is through May. Series As and Series Seed volumes spiked dramatically in 2013, more than doubling the previous years’ investment counts. Series C is relatively constant and Series B varies a bit, but I suspect mostly because the volumes are relatively small. Only about 5 hardware companies raise Series Bs each year, according to this data set. I wonder how the 2014 market will evolve. On one hand, the seed volumes this year are much smaller than I expected, but that may be due to companies operating in stealth, rather than an actual decline in investment activity. I’ll have to wait for the Crunchbase data to fill in before drawing a conclusion. Overall, though, there’s no question hardware startups have witnessed a recent surge particularly in the seed market both in number of seeds raised and the average sizes of those seeds. In 2013, these hardware startups raised nearly twice as many Series As as the preceding few years, a strong positive signal. Hardware is in vogue and hardware startups are attracting the capital they need to  grow, in greater and  greater numbers.

Benjamin Morris, a writer for arguably the best computational journalism publication, fivethirtyeight , published “Lionel Messi is Impossible” which describes in words, statistics and charts why Lionel Messi is one of the greatest players in the world. Even if you’re not a soccer/football fan, the article is worth reading because it’s one of the finest examples of synthesizing data and a story to convey a point I’ve read in a very long time. Data is one of the most powerful ingredients to supporting a point of view. It’s one of the reasons I publish data analysis on this blog. But data alone isn’t enough - not nearly enough - to be compelling. The story woven from the data makes an article or post or argument successful, not the other way around. Morris’ article is superb for three reasons. First, each chart succinctly conveys a single point. The charts are simple but the analysis underpinning them is not. Achieving that simplicity from complexity isn’t easy. Second, and fortunately so, the data present a very clear and consistent story. Each plot depicts Messi’s exceptional performance as a striker compared to his peers. Without such an exceptional career and statistics, this story would have been far less compelling. In other words, the data clearly supports the narrative. Third, Morris openly discusses the blind spots of each analysis and has anticipated the readers’ questions himself, which is a terrific way of managing doubt. Two thirds of the way through the article, for example, Morris changes the analysis from Messi the individual, to Messi the team player. “By this point, it should be evident that Messi has at least a little bit of skill. But there’s still heavy lifting to do: We have to show that he actually makes his team better.” Simply put, “Lionel Messi Is Impossible” is a terrific example of great computational journalism. And I’m hopeful that this kind of thinking, presenting and story-telling will become much more common both in the press, but also within companies and startups. There are a huge number of ways to deploy this skill within companies: whittling user stories and personas from data to improve product design, carving insights from sales and marketing performance data to illustrate best practices, and distilling the success of customers into white papers and sales collateral. We’re just at the beginning of sophisticated, data-supported story-telling. But it’s a trend that is improving the way we communicate and support our arguments. Instead of telling and opining and pontificating, we’re showing and exhibiting and revealing, which is ultimately, a more powerful way to tell a story.

I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man I’d sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town He’d tousle my hair and say son take a good look around. This is your hometown My Hometown by Bruce Springsteen Hometown investors, the local group of angels and VCs within a startup community, are an essential part of startup ecosystems. They can be great connectors, providers of advice and most importantly, suppliers of the venture capital to enable startups to grow. I was curious if hometown investment patterns differ across the 10 major cities in the US. I’m defining hometown investment is the share of dollars raised by a startup contributed by investors based in the startup’s hometown. For example, a NYC startup that raises a $1.5M seed from New York investors and then a $5M A from Boston investors would have a 23% hometown investor share. Using Crunchbase data, I calculated the hometown share in the 10 major startup cities in the US over the past 4 years. The chart above shows the fraction of hometown dollars by city and by fundraising stage for Series A, B, C and Seed. I had to make some assumptions about the data, particularly in the case of multi-investor rounds because of the granularity of the Crunchbase data, so there is some error rate I can’t control for in the data. But the data is interesting despite the higher error rate. The data exposes three tiers of hometown investor behavior: Tier Cities % Hometown Investment 1 San Francisco 53% 2 Austin, Boston, Chicago, New York, Washington 24% 3 Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Portland, San Diego, Seattle 11% Not surprisingly, San Francisco Bay Area which is the largest startup market has the highest hometown investment share at greater than 50%. In other words, 50 cents of every dollar raised by San Francisco-based startups is invested by San Francisco investors. In the second tier of hometown investor cities, 24 cents of every dollar are hometown dollars and for the third tier, it’s 11 cents. It’s important to note that the discrepancy in hometown investor share increases as a company raises later rounds. In the seed stage, hometown investors exhibit similar investment rates, somewhere between 15-25%. But as the round size increases, even at the A, institutional VCs with larger fund sizes skew the data to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Though we don’t have direct knowledge of the fundraising processes of each of these companies, which makes it impossible to compare the length and difficulty of each process, it’s fair to presume companies based in the Bay Area travel less to raise their rounds compared to other founders in other cities. Nevertheless, at the outset, it’s the hometown investors in each of these cities that provides the capital to get startups off the ground and they seem to be contributing equally across most of the major startup cities in the US.

A terrific SaaS VP of Marketing once told me, “If the sales team is focused on hitting this quarter’s revenue target, then the marketing team ought to be focused on next quarter and the following quarter.” In SaaS companies, one of the marketing department’s primary responsibilities is generating sufficient customer interest to enable the company to achieve their revenue targets. If that’s the case, determining how and when to scale a sales team in a SaaS company is contingent upon the marketing team’s metrics. It would be a mistake to hire a swath of salespeople, assign them quotas and then fail to provide them with enough inbound lead flow to succeed. In that case, marketing would be the limiting factor in the business. Of course, some startups ask their salesforces to generate their own leads. But after reading Aaron Ross’s Predictable Revenue and seeing the process implemented in several SaaS companies, I believe asking salespeople to generate leads in addition to closing them is be suboptimal in most cases Most SaaS startups hire a salesperson or two before hiring a marketing team. During the initial phases of discovering the sales pitch and refining the process, this sequence makes sense. But as a SaaS company scales, the company must begin to mechanize the sales process. A sales process is mechanized when the company has a high degree of confidence in the marginal revenue contribution of the new salesperson before hiring him/her. And the prerequisite to sales mechanization is consistently generating a pipeline large enough to feed the sales team. How big of a pipeline is necessary? The table below sketches out the math for a typical inside sales rep. Parameter Value Inside Sales Quota ($k) 350 Average Selling Price ($k) 10 Sales per Year 35 Lead-to-Close Success Rate 20% Total Leads Required per ISR 175 Marketing Lead Contribution 50% MQLs per Inside Salesperson per Year 88 MQL Sales Pipeline per ISR per Month ($k) 73 Inside Sales Quota - Quota varies from about $250,000 to $750,000, depending on the product, the sector and many other variables. Average Selling Price -  Also called revenue per customer, this the average amount a customer pays to use the product. There is a large large variance by company and by sector, but 50% of products fall within $5-$100k , across the basket of public SaaS companies I track. Sales per Year - This a division of the quota by the ASP and is the number of sales at the ASP a salesperson must close to achieve quota. Lead-to-Close Success Rate - This is a measure of how effective the sales team is at closing leads, and also a metric of how well qualified the leads are before they reach the sales team. Total Leads Required per ISR - Given the ISR’s quota and the close rate, this figure is an estimate of the total volume of leads a salesperson requires in a year to achieve quota and close the target number of sales per year. Marketing Lead Contribution - As the Bizo and Oracle research shows, marketing contributes about 20-60% of leads . The remainder are generate by the sales teams’ outbound efforts. I’ve taken the midpoint of the survey estimates for this calculation. MQLs per Inside Salesperson per Year - Given the marketing contribution, this is the gross lead count for each salesperson to achieve quota. MQL Sales Pipeline per ISR per Month - The total value of the leads marketing will generate in a month, according to this plan. For this hypothetical example using approximate data, the marketing team must generate about $900k in pipeline per year per inside salesperson to hit plan. Before investing heavily in growing a sales team, SaaS companies should understand if the marketing team can generate sufficient leads to feed the sales team’s pipeline, which is the key to salesforce mechanization and repeatable growth.

Earlier this week, the Commerce Department announced US GDP in Q1 2014 fell by 3% , the most in a quarter since the recession. I’ve linked to the WSJ’s chart depicting the trend above. The decline was 3x greater than forecasted. Silicon Valley seems unfazed. As I wrote about earlier this year, we’ve seen a decline in the public markets of about 25% in consumer stocks and 45% in enterprise stocks . But since that time, public tech companies have witnessed a small recovery. Both enterprise and consumer companies are up 18% from their 10 month lows. Below are two charts showing the “average” consumer and enterprise tech company’s share price progressing over time, compared to their share price 10 months ago. A value of zero means the stock is at the same price as ten months ago. A value of 10 means the stock is 10% higher than 10 months ago. Consumer has been impacted a bit more than enterprise but on the whole, both categories of companies are increasing in value again, despite the broader economic challenges in Q1. And forward revenue to enterprise value multiples are on the rise again. As of today, the mean next-twelve months to enterprise value multiple is 7.5, up from 5.5 in May . The businesses created in Startupland are real companies, generating meaningful revenue, growing quickly and changing industries. Despite large institutional investors cycling out of growth stocks and into value stocks, which caused the April decline in many names, tech is booming and as a result, seems to be insulated from the broader economy. If you’re curious about the movements of individual names over the past tens months, the share prices for the roughly 50 companies across both baskets are below.

Google revealed many novel projects and products at yesterday’s Google IO Conference. At the moment, I’m most curious about the development of Android Wear, in part because of the beautiful Motorola 360 watch and in part because I suspect connected watches bring substantial change to the mobile device market. It’s easy to write off watches as a niche product. But the addressable market of Android users is now large enough that even a single digit market penetration means tens of millions of users and a potentially interesting new platform for startups to build applications upon. Android counts 1B monthly active users on the platform. A 5% marketshare implies 50M watch users. The total mobile market is now sufficiently large that even niche segments amass substantial user bases. For example, phablets, phones with 5 inch screens or larger which are frequently scoffed at, now represent 21% of Android sales . Additionally, watches have the potential to cannibalize fitness tracker sales, particularly for the less serious athletes, because Motorola’s first watch, the Moto 360, has embedded hardware necessary to offer much of the same functionality within the watch. To put that market in context, $330M of Fitbits and Nike Fuel bands were sold in 2013 sales or approximately 3M units. Third, since the era of Motorola’s RAZR, the mobile phone has become a fashion accessory, a status symbol. Watches fit naturally into that social dynamic. Moreover, watches can be easily customized and changed to meet the demands of many different customer segments: high and low end, men and women, casual and formal. In some European countries, it’s not uncommon to have a utilitarian phone for work and a beautiful phone for the weekend. Why not the same with a watch? Also, watches have the potential to change the negative social perception of checking a phone during a meeting or dinner. People do it all the time, but it’s impolite. A watch on the other hand, permits less obstrusive interruptions. Last, the Android Wear software looks incredibly useful, exactly what Dick Tracy might have wanted in his 2-way radio. Users can tie voice commands to 3rd party applications like calling an Uber. Speaking to watch is a better UX for a user because it’s faster than pulling a phone from a pocket, unlocking it, firing up the app, selecting your location and then clicking the Dispatch UberX button. This opportunity to tie a voice command to an app creates stickiness for app developers. Smart watches won’t be for everybody, but Android Wear and smart watches don’t need to be to grow into an important consumer product and eventually development platform. We’re right on the precipice of a potentially large and interesting new way to enable users to interact with the world.

Last week, the team at Wharton in San Francisco invited me to speak at the Entrepreneurs Workshop. I chose the topic of the “Five Forces Shaping the Fundraising Market” and prepared a Mary Meeker style presentation, with a chart and a bullet point on each slide, to illustrate the forces in tension. It was great fun. I’ve embedded the slides from the presentation above and will link to the video once it’s live. To help provide some context to charts, I’ve summarized the five forces below. These are the five major forces shaping the fundraising market today: The Fundraising Market is Stable, Despite Public Market Fluctuations. The dollars in and out of the venture market are relatively constant. LPs are investing into venture capital at a steady, and likely increasing rate. Over the last five years, dollars into the venture industry has remained at or below the 12 year median. 2014 looks to be a bit of a stronger year. VCs are investing at a relatively constant pace and at a relatively constant average dollars per investment. The public market correction in consumer and enterprise stocks in February was real and significant, deflating consumer by 25% and enterprise by 40%+. Many of those companies have rebounded some since the lows, but institutional investors have broadly cycled from growth to value stocks. Valuations may be more varied but total capital invested in startups is constant. Startups are Much More Capital Efficient than they Were Ten Years Ago. Startups require 50% of the capital of 12 years ago to become publicly traded companies or reach twice the revenue on the same dollars invested. Some outliers are substantially much more efficient than that. This efficiency is driven by lower cost-of-customer acquisition because of better acquisition channels and lower infrastructure costs. For the Most Attractive Startups, Seed Rounds Have Replaced Series As. Seed investment dollars have tripled in 4 years, driven mostly by VCs. When VCs participate in seed rounds, round sizes are on average 3x larger. VC seed round sizes have continued to grow by about 10% each year since 2010 and the number of MegaSeeds, i.e., those seeds greater than $2M, has grown by 5x in 3 years. Series Bs Are The Hardest Rounds to Raise. The growth in seed rounds and seed stage companies has expanded the number of companies raising Series A. The Series A market has responded somewhat. Total Series As have roughly doubled as seed volumes have tripled. But Series B rounds have remained flat. Because the capital allocated to Series Bs has remained flat, competition is increasing for those dollars and follow-on success rates have fallen. Growth Stage MegaRounds Have Replaced or Delayed IPOs. Megarounds, private market investments similar in size to typical tech IPOs of $75-200M, have become increasingly common, growing by 3x+ over the last four years. This capital enables larger startups to delay IPO and the regulatory overhead accompanying it. The fundraising market is stable because today the many forces in tension, dollars in, dollars-out, exits, competition, and the public market, all balance out. I’m hopeful we won’t see a significant change in the market for a while. But if/when we do, it will be because one of these forces suffers a discontinuous change.

There’s a cyclicality to fundraising. Certain sectors rise quickly and become competitive while others decline. I’ve been wondering about the state of the market. First, which sectors are in vogue now in Seed investing and Series A investing? Second, is there a delay between the sectors attracting seed capital and Series A capital? In other words, do seed investors see trends before VCs do? The chart above shows the trends in the seed investment market. This data is Crunchbase data filtered for the largest 20 or so sectors from 2010-2013. Each graph shows the fraction of relevant seeds in a particular segment over time. The hottest sectors, those with a sudden increase in seed investment share, include some obvious ones: Hardware + Software, Health and Wellness, and Messaging. The hardware startup movement has been catapulted by the success of crowdfunding, and the quantified self movement has amassed some tremendous momentum as well. More interestingly, though, there are a few surprises: Automotive, ECommerce, and Fashion. The sectors in decline include Advertising, a challenging sector because of the market dominance of Google and Facebook, and Big Data, whose investment share had spiked two years ago creating a swell of competition, and Android. Let’s contrast the seed investment patterns with Series A patterns. I ran the same analysis for the top 20 or sectors in the Series A market. The patterns are similar but not identical. Some winners like Hardware + Software, Health and Wellness, and ECommerce are consistent. But Automotive and Fashion didn’t garner large enough Series A share to surface in this analysis. Series A investors seem to be more bullish on Android companies than seed investors do; perhaps it’s an artifact of latency. The Android startups which raised seeds in 2011 and 2012 raised As in 2013. Series A investors are pursuing Analytics with more gusto than seed investors. Which raises the question, how quickly do Series A investors respond to the trends in the seed market? The chart below overlays the Series A trends across the Seed categories in the top chart of this post. Looking at the data on an annual basis, and though there are exceptions, Series A investors quickly respond to trends in the seed market. In fact, the investment patterns have an annual correlation coefficient of 0.83, indicating a very strong synchronicity. Series A investors follow the patterns set by seed investors, or at the very least, both tend to invest in the same markets at  the same time. Getting a bit more granular, we can compare the investment correlation patterns by quarter. Same Quarter +1 Quarter +2 Quarters +3 Quarters +4 Quarters Correlation Coefficient 0.68 0.65 0.63 0.64 0.49 The table above shows the data. The coefficient, indicating similar sector investments, is highest during the same quarter and degrades slightly for the next three quarters and then falls suddenly nine months later.  When a sector becomes hot in the seed market, it’s hot for another nine months in the Series A market, and then it begins to cool.

Jill LePore’s New Yorker polemic “ The Disruption Machine ” attempts to debunk the incredibly popular Innovator’s Dilemma, a theory written by HBS professor Clayton Christensen. I’ve been reading the debate around it with some interest. It’s becoming a really interesting conversation but I think the debate is focused on the wrong thing - whether or not these ideas are absolutely correct, even axiomatic. They aren’t always true. But that doesn’t mean these concepts are useless. Quite the opposite. This morning, Nassim Taleb introduced a second idea into the debate when he wrote to Marc Andreessen: The Lindy Effect is an idea credited to Albert Goldman and says “the future career expectations of a television comedian is proportional to the total amount of his past exposure on the medium.” In his book Antifragile, Taleb expands this theory to all of human development. Taleb summarized his view on the theory in an op-ed titled “ The Surprising Truth: Technology is Aging in Reverse ,” published in Wired in 2012. While Taleb’s Wired Op-Ed explains the Lindy Effect, it struggles to apply it broadly: But what about a technology that we currently see as inefficient and dying, like print newspapers, land lines, or physical storage for tax receipts? People often counter my argument by presenting such examples. To which I respond: The Lindy Effect is not about every technology, but about life expectancy — which is simply a probabilistically derived average. The first challenge with both the Lindy Effect and the Innovator’s Dilemma is neither are predictive, as Taleb says above. Neither Taleb nor Christensen maintains a list of the industries or companies likely to be disrupted, for example. Both theories are great descriptive tools for describing history, but not predicting the future. The second challenge is that both are theories supported by selective examples. Christensen’s examples are, in large part, undermined by LePore’s research. The Lindy Effect works until it doesn’t. The paper book will continue to flourish until the point the ebook takes over. Same with ceramic plates. Despite those flaws, both theories are incredibly useful as frameworks to describe industry dynamics. The entire freemium world is predicated on Christensen’s Innovators Dilemma. Enterprise incumbents, constrained by large costs-of-customer-acquisition, can’t compete with startups who acquire customers for near-free , harkening Christensen’s mini-mill analogy. The Lindy Effect describes the decision-making inertia captured in the aphorism “no one gets fired for buying IBM.” With one phrase, a founder can summarize the competitive dynamics within an industry. Disruption will happen in certain sectors and long-incumbent technologies will continue to prevail in others. In some sense, these are the main forces in tension in most sectors. While these neither theories apply to every industry nor every set of companies competing with each other, they are useful descriptive frameworks for talking about industry dynamics, despite their flaws.

Recently I met a startup founder who explained a technique for building his product roadmap in a novel way. “We research what our users are doing three minutes before they start using our product and the three minutes after.” I like the idea because it is a simple and ingenious mechanism for brainstorming product ideas, and this type of product development exploration evokes empathy from a product team, which is a the first step of the Stanford d.School and IDEO’s Design Thinking Processes . The 3 minute techniques surfaces three potentially interesting avenues for a product’s future development. First, it helps a product team explore how the product’s scope might expand to include the tasks a user currently performs immediately before or after using the current product. Broadening a product’s feature set to include adjacent activities should increase engagement and ultimately retention. Second, the 3 minutes technique should reveal the users’ mindset at the point of using a product, which has implications for design. Great product design is telepathic .  The secret to telepathy is empathy. Is the user in a rush? Does the user have a particular task to complete when logging into the product? How can the product rise to anticipate the needs of the user in this mindset? Third, this technique reveals the cues that trigger a user to log-in. To be successful, products must change user behavior .  Understanding which of hundreds of potential triggers like summary emails, push notifications, an internal workflow process, a particular time of day or week is critically important key to enticing users to return to the product time and again. I’m curious to know if you have other techniques like the 3 minute technique for exploring user workflows, building empathy and developing a product roadmap to anticipate user needs. Let me know in the comments.

Since it was first written in 1982, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol , the mechanism for sending emails, has remained largely remained unchanged.  Today SMTP delivers 70 trillion emails to 5B inboxes each year . Overwhelmed by tens of thousands of emails, most of us can sympathize with Nick Bilton, who said: There is no escape: Email is probably most invasive form of communication yet devised. Unlike SMTP, email is changing very quickly. In particular, email is undergoing a great unbundling, similar to Craigslist’s, in which startups are seizing upon important use cases of a generic service and building a better, dedicated version of it as a stand-alone company/product. This is happening to a certain extent in consumer products like ephemeral messaging (SnapChat) and location sharing (Glympse). But the trend is much broader in B2B products. I’ve seen it first-hand when we switched to RelateIQ as our CRM. Instead of going to my email inbox in the morning to see what’s new with the opportunities we’re evaluating at Redpoint, I go to RelateIQ. First, to be able to see across the inboxes of my partners, and see all the companies we’re speaking to. Second, to be able to quickly find information relevant to a particular company or person: all the email/meeting history. Third, to enforce a workflow around email, e.g., timely follow-ups.  All of these emails to and from startups, I handle within RelateIQ, not Gmail. This trend of segmenting email into a dedicated, smart-inbox-with-workflow is broader than CRM. Customer support software like Zendesk is probably the oldest example of an app that segments a chunk of email and wraps it with prescriptive workflow. LinkedIn’s InMail is a similar system for recruiting. Yammer has removed water-cooler emails from inboxes. Contactually segments email for network relationship management. Similarly, I believe every major category of large volume, workflow email will be segmented into a dedicated app in this way. Most users won’t want more than a few separate inboxes, perhaps 1-3. But those 1-3 inboxes will be disproportionately valuable because users will live in those dedicated inboxes. These dedicated apps enable users to win their time back by providing all the context users need to act upon the email. Mobile is an important driver for email segmentation because the lack of contextual information makes it even more difficult to process emails than usual. Machine learning is a second key enabler because it enables filtering, categorization and smart reminders. At this point in email’s unbundling, the volume of email in our business inboxes hasn’t declined, and it may never decline because most of the automation is on the outbound side, making it easier and easier to send larger volumes of email. When both sender and receiver have intelligent workflow apps or are trained to log into workflow apps first, the most effective way of reminding users to return to workflow won’t be email reminders or push messages. And then, perhaps email volumes will fall. But, even if email volumes don’t decline, workflow-based email products will enable us to process much larger volumes of email than we are today.

Several weeks ago, I wrote a post about the Optimal Contract Value for a SaaS company. I wondered whether startups serving enterprises might be more or less valuable than those serving small-to-medium businesses (SMBs). Interestingly, the data showed there was no optimal customer value to build a publicly traded SaaS company. Having written that post, I began to wonder about other differences between different types of SaaS companies. In particular, do SaaS startups serving SMBs spend more or less than their counterparts in the mid-market and enterprise? And which type of SaaS startup grows the fastest? To answer those questions, I’ve pulled together data from a basket of 46 publicly traded SaaS/Cloud companies and segmented them based on their average annual customer value (ACV) into three buckets: SMB (<$10k), Midmarket, (>=$10k to < $100k) and Enterprise (>$100k). Below I’ve charted the median trends of these companies as they progress from their founding over the next ten years. These four charts contrast sales & marketing investments and revenue growth trends across the three different SaaS startup segments. The chart above depicts the Sales & Marketing (S&M) spend across the three segments. The median SMB SaaS startup spends significantly less on sales and marketing through year 4 of their lives. Presumably, these startups are driven to find more cost-effective means of customer acquisition, like freemium , because the smaller ACVs can’t accommodate larger cost-of-customer acquisition. As the company’s revenue grows, however, SMB companies’ S&M expenditure converges with Midmarket and Enterprise companies. The mid-market and enterprise companies can afford to hire large sales and marketing teams to acquire customers and spend statistically identical amounts on sales and marketing throughout. The next most important question, of course, is how those sales & marketing investments translate into revenue growth. The chart above shows that despite the important differences in sales and marketing spend, the SMB companies in the dataset (who have been successful enough to IPO), have sustained equivalent revenue growth rates to their sales-team-driven brethren. Presumably, these SMBs SaaS startups found a scalable customer acquisition channel that either complemented or wholly replaced the sales and marketing teams in the early days. If you’re curious about the median gross S&M spend by segment, the chart above shows that. And the chart below plots the median revenue by segment. These two charts do show one counterintuitive trend: Midmarket SaaS startups tend to generate more revenue than either SMBs or Enterprise. In Segmenting the SaaS Market for Sales Success , we showed that the number of employees in very small, medium and very large companies is roughly equal. So, for a startup pricing per seat, the market opportunity is equivalent. But the substantially larger revenues of Midmarket companies shows that these companies are able to penetrate their market more deeply and ultimately capture more revenue. Perhaps these companies strike the best balance between large enough ACVs to justify sales investment and minimize the customization often required of large enterprise software: this powerful combination minimizes sales costs while accelerating sales velocity.  Or so the data suggests. It’s important to note that the dataset I’ve used is quite small and the number of data points on any given year for a given segment number no more than 10. This means that for most of the comparisons, there is no statistically significant difference between the data of SMB, Midmarket and Enterprise companies’ sales & marketing investments or revenue growth, which is itself an interesting conclusion. There is only one exception to this:  the S&M expenditure of SMB SaaS companies is significantly lower in their early years than in other segments. Also, these benchmarks are medians and they mask the variance across companies. Each of these companies pursued unique approaches in the market that enabled them to become leaders in their field and the aggregate statistics will never be able to communicate those unique stories. Thanks to Dan Siroker who inspired this post.

Is it better to raise your startup’s seed round from only angel investors, or is it better to include a VC or two? Several founders on the precipice of launching their seed fundraising processes have asked me this question. It’s a very difficult one to answer hypothetically because there are many different variables to balance. For example, VCs may invest larger sums than angel investors. The imprimatur of a VC’s investment in a company might help convince potential customers and recruits. But some might argue their money brings potential signaling risk. So I’ve tried to answer the complex question using Crunchbase data from 2009 to today. Below, I compare and contrast the fundraising histories of about 3700 startups that have raised seeds. About 1/3 of these startups raised exclusively from “angels.” I’m using the word angels broadly; it includes individual investors, incubators and accelerators. The other 2/3s raised from a combination of sources but include at least one VC. The typical seed round with VCs has 1.6 VCs involved . I’ve filtered the data to look only at VCs who have invested in at least 50 companies during the past 5 years to ensure we’re only looking at truly active market participants. Metric Angel Seeds VC Seeds Series A Success Rate 33% 54% Mean Seed Raised $M 1.3 1.6 Median Seed Raised $M 1.2 1.5 Mean Series A Raised $M 7.3 7.4 Median Series A Raised $M 5.3 6.0 This data surfaces three observations: Startups with at least one VC in their seed round raise Series As 64% more often than do angel-backed startups. I can’t prove causation, i.e., that having a VC involved is the cause of this increase because of the limitations of the data. But I believe the next observation sheds some light onto this trend. VC-backed seed rounds are 23% larger on average, which is statistically significant to greater than 99% confidence. This makes sense. VCs typically invest from larger funds and are more willing to invest more dollars in seed rounds. And, we’ve previously shown that larger seed rounds correlate to higehr follow on rates for Series As . A longer runway enables startups to experiment more, and ideally become larger, more attractive investments for Series A investors. Curiously, there is no statistically significant difference in the size of Series A rounds between the two categories of startups. Successful angel-seeded companies raise just as much money as VC-seeded companies. In other words, a great entrepreneur can come from anywhere . To further prove the point, I’ve charted the distributions of Series As below. Angel seeds are in blue and VC seeds are in red. They are, in fact, identical. Now to dig into the signaling risk question. The table below contrasts the financing histories of VC-backed seeds as a whole with the 351 companies in the data set who raised their Series A from a VC participating in their seed. Metric Insider VC Leads A All VC Seeds Mean Seed Raised $M 1.6 1.6 Median Seed Raised $M 1.5 1.5 Mean Series A Raised $M 7.2 7.4 Median Series A Raised $M 5.8 6.0 This time, there are two important conclusions: Insider VCs lead Series As in about 26% of their seeds.  The remaining 28% of seed-financed startups who raised As accepted terms from new investors. In other words, an equal amount of startups raise Series As from VC insiders as outsiders. Startups who raise Series As from outsider VCs fare just as well as those who raise from an insider VC. Round sizes are nearly identical, both in the seed and A, mean and median. Furthere, there’s no statistically signficant difference across any of the metrics. In other words, the presence of a VC investor in the seed round doesn’t seem to impact a startup’s ability to raise a Series A at market terms. Raising larger seed rounds improve the odds that a startup will be able to raise a series A. It’s easier to raise larger rounds from VCs than angels simply because of fund size differences, but the source of the capital, whether angel, incubator or early stage VC doesn’t meaningfully impact a startup’s ability to raise a Series A at a market price. Nor does raising a Series A from a VC insider.

For the past several years, early stage VCs have entered the seed market with vigor. VC’s entry has resulted five different important trends in the past five years: The total dollars entering the seed market has increased by 132%. The mean seed round size has increased by 114% to $1.4M. VCs’ typical seed investment has grown by 50%. Mega-seeds, those seed investments over $2M, have reached historic highs exceeding 80 instances in 2013. The mean mega-seed round is $2.26M during the past five years but in 2013 that figure reached $2.8M, which implies mega-seeds have replaced traditional early Series A. Though total number of seed investments increased by 30% comparing 2013 to 2011, but astoundingly, the total dollars entering the seed ecosystem has increased by 132%. The impact of VCs on the seed market is hard to overstate. I’ve taken Crunchbase data and split the seed financings based on those with venture investors involved and those without. The typical angel round size over the same time period is shown below. Over the past six years, the average round size has varied from about $200k to about $500k most recently. The median rests around $150k. Let’s compare this with the trends of seed rounds with VCs. Seed rounds with VCs are much bigger and have doubled in size in 5 years from $1M to more than $2M. The growth is statistically significant with greater than 95% confidence for all years. The trend is real. As these round sizes increase, I wondered if VCs are investing more and underwriting larger investments or if VCs are syndicating more. The Crunchbase data indicates the average number of investors in a seed round involved with a VC is about 1.6; the median is 1.6. This data implies VCs are writing larger checks into seed investments. The next question is whether those larger checks occur throughout the ecosystem or only in certain segments. Let’s evaluate the quartiles of seed rounds over that time. A quartile analysis will tell us whether the trends impact the market as a whole or just certain parts of the market. The quartile chart above shows that the top of the market, the 100% quartile has reached unbelievable heights, with the most competitive seed rounds, aka MegaSeeds, raising in excess of $5M for the past few years. In these cases, seed rounds are simply highly syndicated series As. Though it’s hard to see in the chart, every other quartile has increased by more than 50% over the time period. One could argue the top part of the market is pulling the rest of the market up. Additionally, the wave of newer institutional seed funds could be contributing to the increases in round sizes. The number of MegaSeeds has been steadily increasing from below 10 to more than 80 in about 5 years. And the chart below shows the distribution of MegaSeed round sizes over the time period. The mean mega-seed round is $2.2M over the time period and exceeded $2.75M in 2013. The seed market five years ago was a much quieter market than it is today. As VCs have entered the market, they have increased the number of seeds and the dollars entering the market dramatically. Over time, the increased competition in the market has steadily increased the size of seeds which has now reached a point that the largest seeds have replaced the traditional early Series A.

Marketing investments are unlike any other investment a startup. They are the least-tangible, least-measurable investments and that’s why they are perceived as the riskiest investments. After raising a round of capital, a startup’s management team has a pool of capital to invest. They can choose from different projects: growing the engineering team to build products faster, spending more on infrastructure to speed page load times, moving to a bigger office, adding salespeople to prospect more customers. All of the aforementioned products have long-term value and the benefit of the investment can be seen immediately. New hires are in the office every day and will remain with the company for years. The speed benefits of faster infrastructure accrue to the company daily and a better product engenders a happier customer base. But marketing spend is different. A dollar spent to distribute a marketing campaign may buy ad impressions that the company never sees At Google, we ran into this problem often. An AdWords advertiser would call their salesperson and say, “We spent $50k on AdSense last month, but our CEO couldn’t find our ad. Can you send me a screenshot of the ad running on the placements we bought?” Those CEOs were searching for tangibility beyond the impression and click reports offered in the AdWords UI.  Their dollar had vanished, so they thought, unlike the new salesperson making calls a few feet away from the CEO’s desk. On top of this, if you believe the tired aphorism that half of marketing dollars are wasted, but no one knows which half, then the odds of making money with marketing spend is about the same as playing a hand in BlackJack.  Like a scratched off lottery ticket, I could argue residual value of a marketing campaign is often zero or very close to zero. Poof! Once, spent the dollar is gone. Of course, that’s probably too strong a statement. A performance marketing campaign can generate leads for the sales team to close, and a content marketing campaign can increase brand awareness, or a brand advertising campaign can improve the brand’s perception and thereby increase the value of the brand. The challenge with the latter two examples is the lack of tangibility or method to measure it, which is at the core of what makes marketing investments unique and challenging. And the challenge with performance marketing is the attribution problem: which of the seven ad units the customer saw actually triggered them to buy our product? The first, the six in-between and/or the last one? Yesterday, I spoke with a sophisticated marketer and she mentioned a marketing concept that was new to me called ROMO or Return on Marketing Objectives. In addition to a pure return on investment (ROI) calculation, ROMO includes measurements of changes in brand equity value, Net-Promoter Score and brand-recall metrics to measure the impact of a marketing dollar. Broadening out the way to measure of marketing spend makes sense to me because it helps articulate more of the value of a dollar of marketing spend. After all, intuitively we know Superbowl ads increase brand awareness , which can be incredibly valuable, even if the ads don’t immediately increase sales. I’m not sure if we will ever get to point where we can truly quantify marketing and eliminate the risks startups face in spending marketing dollars. Understanding the chemistry between an ad unit, or a blog post, or a tweet and a prospective customer may be too difficult or simply impossible to measure for certain types of marketing spend. Finding ways of getting a sense of marketing impact, like ROMO, may be helpful in the meantime, though, to describe some of the broader impacts of a dollar of marketing spend.

HBS Professor Michael Porter created the Five Forces Framework in 1979 in a landmark book called Competitive Strategy . One of those forces, the threat of substitutes has intrigued me for quite a while because in the world of the Internet, the prevailing wisdom on switching costs argues they are trivial on the web. After all, how difficult is it to change from Google search to Bing search? This is the question Google wrestled with during its search share battle in the mid 00s. In most of the consumer web, I’ve come to believe switching costs are significantly greater than I ever suspected. A few months ago, I switched my home storage from Dropbox to Google Drive. On the surface, the services are identical, perhaps differing a bit in price. I thought, no switching costs in this market. But transferring the files from Dropbox and uploading them to Google took an entire weekend of file uploads. It was grueling and my wife asked me why I spent all the time to switch for such a tiny gain. Next, I replaced Rdio with Spotify. Both services have for all intents and purposes identical content libraries, but the user interfaces differ which required learning something new and the playlists didn’t port. I had to rebuild them from scratch. Again, time spent for a tiny gain. Switching from one product to another requires effort: the time to learn new software and build new behaviors. This is why so many US businesses still use Excel for their book keeping and Word for everything else. No time investment is required to keep the business going. I’ve been reflecting on this idea of greater actual switching costs in consumer web in the context of Apple’s WWDC announcements. The new products that I suspect will succeed are the ones that reinforce existing behaviors. Connected, the software that enables an iPhone to talk to a Mac to receive calls on the Mac, transfer work seamlessly across devices and fire up a Wifi hotspot is a good example. I bet many people will use that feature because it reinforces existing behavior. I wonder about the features that require behavior change for no gain. The location sharing feature that competes with Glympse. The ephemeral messaging feature rivaling SnapChat. These match third party software feature for feature, but if a customer switches, they’ll face the same question my wife asked me. Why spend the time? To entice millions of users to change requires more than copying and convenience. It’s just not enough to reduce the switching costs by creating feature parity. The product has to motivate users to learn something new. Otherwise, most people will struggle to justify the time investment, which is the hidden and often most important contributor to the switching costs.

In his book Behind the Cloud: The Untold Story of How Salesforce went from Idea to Billion Dollar Company and Revolutionized an Industry , Marc Benioff shares the 111 plays he learned through Salesforce triumphant rise to the most valuable SaaS company in the world. Play 15 is my favorite from the book. Benioff writes “position yourself either as the leader or against the leader in your industry.” Play 15 highilghts the most frequently forgotten of marketing’s four Ps, positioning. Positioning is easily forgotten because it’s the least tangible of the four. Price immediatly impacts revenue. Product, well, everyone has a point of view on product. Placement in today’s ecosystem means ad placements, most often. In performance marketing, the numbers speak for themselves. Positioning can be amorphous. Without a concentrated focus on unique positioning, a company’s persona in the market muddles with competition in a customer’s mind. In Benioff’s words, positioning means: Every experience you give a journalist or potential customer must explain why you are different and incorporate a clear call to action. This does not require a large team or big budget; it just requires your time and focus. Mastering positioning creates huge advantages for a company. Play 38 sums it up well. “Make Every Customer a Member of Your Sales Team.” In other words, equip your champions to make a sale on your behalf. If the purpose of enterprise sales is helping customers get through their own internal buying processes, strong and clear positioning empowers internal evangelists to help close deals. Getting back to Play 15, there’s a simple brilliance to Benioff’s advice of positioning a company either as the leader or the rival of the industry. The company instantly becomes part of every conversation, every blog post, every sales process. This is precisely what happened as Salesforce lobbed a stone at the Siebel’s foot. With an unwavering resolve and a simple but powerful NO SOFTWARE positioning, Salesforce overtook the leader in the CRM market, Siebel Systems in less than a decade. In particular, Salesforce employed guerrilla marketing tactics at Siebel events. In San Francisco, Salesforce hired mock protesters to proclaim the end of software, drawing crowds and police and making Salesforce a major topic at the Siebel conference. In Cannes, Benioff’s team rented out quite literally all the taxis and converted them into mobile Salesforce marketing booths ferrying Siebel conference attendees from the airport to the venue. In San Diego, Salesforce replicated this play with bike rickshaws. Because of the simple, powerful and clear positioning against the market leader, and a relentless insistence to be part of every Siebel event, Salesforce injected themselves into every buying conversation. Positioning is one of those intangible marketing concepts. But the intangilibility shouldn’t get in the way of understanding its potency to dramatically alter the the trajectory of a business. When combined with the three other ps, Positioning can pack quite a punch.

Is there a common characteristic of successful freemium companies? Piotr asked this question earlier this week. This is the framework I’ve seen work well for freemium startups. At its core, freemium is a novel marketing tactic that entices new users and ultimately potential customers to try a product and educate themselves about its benefits on their own. By shifting the education workload from a sales team to the customer, the cost of sales can decrease dramatically. So, freemium can be a huge strategic advantage in a competitive market because those companies that successfully implement freemium can scale faster and more efficiently than traditional sales-driven companies might. Successful freemium companies do three things: First, they use free to market, educate and win mindshare. The nature of sales processes is evolving as Daniel Pink eloquently argued in his book To Sell is Human . The Internet enables potential customers to research products much more deeply before engaging with a sales person. Freemium is the ultimate embodiment of that change because customers can use the product before buying it. Second, freemium startups leverage usage data to improve their product. The large amount of users using the product enables A/B testing with statistical significance, a non-trivial strategic advantage. Marketing teams can sift through the data to understand market segmentation and funnel efficiency, and product management can parse the data to improve the on-boarding experience. Third, freemium startups gather information about their customer base to prioritize their sales efforts. When customers sign up or download a free product, freemium companies should gather data about the user to understand who they are and analyze the usage patterns of these users. With enough user data, it’s possible to predict with great accuracy which users will become large accounts. Yammer employed this tactic to prioritize leads for the inside sales team, with great results. The measure of success of a freemium campaign is revenue, aka converting a user to a paid customer. There are many different sales movements, triggers to generate some value from a user. But I bucket them this way: Convert a free user to a paid user in exchange for certain advanced features or more of the product, eg Evernote charges for offline access, Dropbox charges for more storage. Win several users in a team and leverage the social proof to convert a team or department though inside sales. I’ve called this the Two Step Value Proposition , eg Yammer wins the end user and converts the IT admin who seeks control over the app, Expensify wins the expense reporter with a mobile app but ultimately converts the finance team of a company to paid by offering policy management. Leverage one free user to win many other free or paid users. In some cases, lots of free users increase a company’s rank and visibility in the app store, attracting customers. In other cases, incentivized referral programs like Dropbox’s enable free users to continue to free-ride in exchange for driving revenue from others. A nice quid-pro-quo. Freemium models can be attractive, but they don’t work in every case. Startups should consider freemium when three conditions are met: the number of potential users numbers in the tens of millions, free distribution is a competitive advantage in the market, the product downloaded by a free user has a simple and straightforward value proposition, and the marginal cost to serve a user is negligible. Freemium conversion funnels tend to be very lossy. On average, 1-4% of users convert to paid, so a startups needs a huge number of users to be able to drive meaningful revenue from a single-digit percentage of users. To reach $100M in annual revenue, a freemium business charging $100 per year with a 4% conversion-to-paid rate would need a total user base of 25M users. Because the freemium model relies on customers to educate themselves, freemium is best used as distribution advantage in established markets with incumbents who bear large customer-acquisition costs. An ancillary benefit, freemium companies can draft behind the sales and marketing efforts of the incumbent behemoths. Initially, freemium startups often serve a smaller customer segment, but can address them more profitably than the incumbent could as a result of a more efficient sales process. Because customers are educating themselves, freemium products have a very short window of attention to seize and convince a user to convert to paid. Therefore, the product has to be straight to the point and solve an immediate need or eliminate pain. Most important, the marginal cost of supporting a free user must be close to negligible. If the cost-to-serve a free user is significant, the freemium model will demand lots of cash to support hordes of free users, and this growth path can be unsustainable if a startup really must acquire 25M users, for example. Freemium doesn’t work for many different businesses, but deployed the right way, freemium marketing strategies can be a hugely strategic weapon for startups.

What are the tradeoffs when considering different sales hiring plans and which is the right one for your startup? There are many different considerations in creating a sales hiring plan. Balancing them all can be tricky, but thinking through the trade-offs is important to scaling the business well. First, let’s compare the financial impact of three different sales hiring strategies: six sales people hired at once, two sales people hired for each of three quarters and one sales person hired each month. In this hypothetical example, the sales people have a $350k annual quota, cost the startup $100k annually, and achieve their quota over six months with the following attainment percentages by month: 0%, 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. The plot at the top of the post compares the MRR trajectory of these three sales strategies. No surprise that hiring the six sales people immediately grows the top line of the business faster. aAfter about the 8th month, all sales strategies reach the same constant growth rate created by six sales people achieving quota. Next, let’s look at the cash implications of each strategy. The chart below shows the net revenue, so the total revenue minus costs of the sales people’s salaries. The Six At Once strategy is 3-4x more cash intensive at the beginning but the net revenue breaks zero one to two months before the other two strategies. In short, the Six At Once strategy values growth over cash and on the other extreme, the Two Per Quarter values slow and steady progress. These two simple models overlook some very important considerations when crafting a sales hiring strategy. Namely: Not every sales hire will be successful. It’s common to see sales attrition rates of 25%-50% annually. With employee turnover at those levels, the negative cash impact of strategies like the six at once can be much larger and ultimately delay the revenue ramp for several months. This is important to model if only to understand the impact on the company’s burn rate. Not all startups building sales teams have built turn-key sales processes in which the customer is identified, the sales process is mechanized,  the infrastructure to create, sign and close contracts is in place, and incentive structures are relatively well-crafted. In fact, most won’t have, so hiring large teams out-of-the-gate may lead to significant under-attainment of quota because of questions and uncertainty around the sales process. Sales materials may not be developed. Qualified lead flow may not be systematically generated. Customer objections may not be well understood and handled. Sales training efforts may not yet be mature enough to support large growth in the sales team. The company needs the right sales management in place to be able to handle a Six at Once strategy, whereas more incremental strategies are much more natural for small product or engineering centric teams to digest. The addition of a sales team to a product-focused company will also alter and ultimately enrich the culture, but the company may need some time to adjust. Understanding the impact of a sales hiring plan on a startup’s business is important both for good financial management of the company, but also to ensure the company is able to meet its revenue targets. Because the sales team imposes demands on the marketing organization for leads and the engineering organization for product delivery and the finance organization for contracts and quotas, growth in the sales organization will cascade into other teams as well. But this simple framework is a good way to get started understanding the impact a sales hiring plan might have on a startup.

Last week, Redpoint held our annual Founder Day gathering. At the event, I listened to the stories of Felix Baumgartner’s record breaking jump from 120,000 feet, heard about the astonishing comeback of the US America’s Cup team and took part in a creativity workshop led by a Stanford Design School professor. In short, the event revolved around doubt. Baumgartner halted the Stratos Project twice during its seven year development. Quite naturally, he was terrified of the jump from space. Ten months before competition, Jimmy Spithill and his crew capsized and destroyed their $10M America’s Cup catamaran that had required twelve months to build. After overcoming that ordeal with round-the-clock shifts to build a new boat, the team found themselves down 1-8 in a race to nine points. The ultimate successes both teams achieved are glorious and unique, and that’s where most of the attention naturally flocks. But the most interesting parts of the stories for me were the doubts, the flubs, the catastrophes; and the processes teams use to recover from them. The successes in both of these cases are very different. But to hear the team captains describe the process to realign and reorient their team, I’d have thought they were working on the same project or sailing the same race. The team leaders used the same cliches to describe overcoming adversity: reinforcing a vision, developing a strong team culture, being open and honest about past failures but always looking forward. All these phrases I’d heard many times before. These banal dictums from successful teams all sound the same because they are the same. And they are often repeated because they’re effective. They are mantras, daily practices of teams to build internal momentum. Later in the day, an IDEO consultant/Design School professor walked the audience through a creativity exercise. We drew portraits of our neighbors, played word games and role played. The professor explained this type of activity formed the basis of practicing creative thought. The goal of the exercise is to stop being so self-aware, let go of our self-doubt and enjoy creativity. Creativity is IDEO’s competitive edge in the marketplace. Ensuring the company can routinely innovate and bring new ideas to old problems is a key to their success. Hearing these three stories about the practice of enabling great teams to accomplish incredible goals was inspiring. The most important learning for me is that great teams have processes, patterns, routines, and the discipline that enables them to recover from near-disaster and overcome doubt.

BYOBI is an acronym I first heard on a telephone call with a VP of Technology at a large corporation. The word is almost unknown today, but I think that it will be one of the largest trends to impact data in the next five years. BYOBI means Bring Your Own Business Intelligence.   This VP of Technology was struggling to enable the sales people, marketers, engineers and others within his business to access the data they needed. The monolithic solution that they had adopted, (I can’t remember if it was MicroStrategy or Cognos or BusinessObjects), satisfied the needs of the one department that had catalyzed the purchasing decision many years ago. Several years on, his team had become inundated with custom data requests that the tools failed to answer and petitions to purchase new types of software.  Unfortunately, his data architecture just wouldn’t allow him to respond to those needs. The image below is a simplified schematic of his architecture. This is the way business intelligence software used to work. On the left-hand side, engineers transform data from handful of databases kept on premises into an internal data warehouse. The data is then modeled and optimized for answering the questions the business has today. Reports and visualizations are then built for easy access. Inevitably, those questions will evolve and new ones will crop up. But at design time, those questions are impossible to anticipate. Inevitably, the BI tool fails to live up to its potential and teams can’t access the data they need. What’s worse, with the explosion of cloud and SaaS software use, the data fragmentation problem has exploded. Now, company data isn’t stored across a collection of databases within the company’s firewalls, but is scattered across thousands of servers all over the world. A diaspora of data. Nevertheless, teams within the company still need to access and process and analyze that data irrespective of where it resides. Faced with this problem, he decided to dramatically transform his data architecture into BYOBI. The image below illustrates BYOBI architecture. There are four fundamental changes with BYOBI: End users decide which reporting/visualization tools to use. Cloud/SaaS databases are now a key data contributor, in addition to the on-premises databases. The different layers of the BI stack have become unbundled and line of business users decide which tool to use, instead of IT. Reporting and visualization occurs primarily on raw data, not data that has been transformed or optimized a priori . Two key innovations enable this tectonic shift in BI, faster databases and better data modeling. Redshift, BigQuery and others are taking the data world by storm because their performance benchmarks are staggering over huge data sets. This enables next generation BI tools to provide real-time responsiveness over all the data, not just a sample of data, as in the past. Data modeling enables data scientists to encode the structure of and relationships among data sets into one compact file and then enable everyone within an organization to ask and answer questions of the data in the correct way, without help. Emboldened by newfound confidence of having one consistent source of truth, the organization becomes empowered to be more decisive and move faster. With this BYOBI architecture, end users decide which tools are the best ones for their use cases. IT’s responsibility becomes data access enablement rather than data request fulfillment. Consequently, the entire team is happier and more productive. BYOBI will become the dominant data architecture over the next ten years. As this shift happens, the newcomers like Looker, which provides novel data modeling and data exploration tools will take significant share from the hegemons of legacy BI. For proof of this coming fragmentation in BI, look no further than Tableau’s success. Now a $4B company serving more than 10,000 customers, Tableau proved end users could influence BI buying decisions. But this is just the beginning of the BYOBI trend. BYOBI will disrupt the $13B business intelligence world, creating massive share shift, giving rise to new, massive companies and enabling teams all over to run their businesses more effectively.

I’m a perpetual freeloader. Like a houseguest who has overstayed his welcome with hundreds of people, I depend upon the generosity of strangers - in particular, software teams. I’ve used HelloFax to sign documents for years, but I haven’t paid them a nickel. The same is true for GMail, Google Docs, TripIt, TypeKit, UberConference, LogMeIn, Evernote, the list goes on. For all of these companies and products, harboring freeloaders like me is part of their growth strategy. At the product’s launch, free plans generate the majority of new users and eventually customers for the business and in the case of B2B companies, leads for the sales team. The positive goodwill engendered by a free product feeds word-of-mouth and the product achieves lift-off. All of this is possible because in small numbers, the marginal costs to support perpetual freeloaders are insignificant. In the past few weeks, I’ve been working with two growth-stage B2B freemium SaaS companies outside the Redpoint portfolio which both have significant perpetual freeloader populations. Like those above, both products launched with free tiers. As word spread about these great products, larger customers started to pull the companies up-market, flourishing contracts 100 to 1000x+ larger than converted-from-free customer base. For 12-18 months, these startups reoriented their product direction and sales effort to focus on these larger customers. Consequently, the businesses grew at a terrific clip. At this point, these startups are exploring how to grow faster. In both of these cases, the freeloaders have become a point of focus. How do we update pricing to generate more revenue from these customers? is the question they each proposed to me. The implication of that question is that the carrying costs of the free tier have become too large to sustain. But before changing pricing, it’s worth asking the question for any startup with a free tier of the value of the free customer base compared to their cost. Because the calculus of that decision for a company at a growth stage may be very different than one just starting out. Every business will value the free tier differently. But here’s the rough framework for determining the value of a free tier to a startup that I’ve been using: Marginal cost to support free customers as a percentage of revenue - includes the infrastructure costs, customer support costs, product management and engineering time, marketing time Marginal benefit in leads and ultimately revenue from the free tier -  benchmark the lead quality, conversion rates, average contract value and ideally ultimate LTV of customers in the free tier compared to customers acquired through inside and outside sales, and marketing/demand generation campaigns. Softer benefits of a free tier - perceived brand benefit of the free tier, potential impact to mobile app rankings or other distribution channels The free pricing tier can be an amazing growth engine. It can be an end unto itself, a lead source that fuels a company to an IPO as in the case of LogMeIn or it can be a booster rocket to moving up-market and pursuing larger customers. In the latter case, the free tier drives a company to support two or even three different customer segments (small, medium and large businesses). This increased breadth taxes the organization. In addition to the growing infrastructure required to support the free tier, customer support, engineering, product management and product marketing carry the burden of managing the needs of very different customer segments. Periodically examining the value of the free tier as a growth engine and comparing the costs to support it is essential as freemium SaaS companies evolve. I suspect for most businesses keeping the free tier is the way to go because the positive brand impact and lead generation capability outweighs the marginal cost per customer. But for some businesses, jettisoning the free-tier booster rocket as the company evolves to focus on an enterprise business will free a business to focus on the opportunity up-market.

One of the single most effective tools SaaS companies can use in order to grow faster isn’t tweaking the product in a particular way or implementing an AB optimization framework or adopting new marketing tactic. Rather, it’s financial judo for structuring contracts and cash collection. Cash is the lifeblood of startups. Cash empowers management teams to invest in all kinds of growth mechanisms. So, it’s no surprise that maximizing a company’s cash to invest in growth is a good thing. The most effective way I’ve seen of maximizing cash in SaaS and subscription businesses is asking customers to pay at the beginning of their contracts. The chart above contrasts the difference in a hypothetical startup’s cash position over the course of 24 months. This hypothetical startup generates $50K in MRR in month 1, grows by 15% month over month and burns $300k per month. The startup has just raised $6M in Series A financing. It’s no exaggeration to say that in one scenario, the startup just scrapes past bankruptcy and in another, the company’s coffers overflow with more than $10M in cash in the bank. The magnitude of the change in the company’s health is hard to overstate. The chart shows five different scenarios: Monthly payment - customers pay each month Quarterly payment - customers pay at the end of each quarter Biannual payment - customers pay at the end of each six month period Annual postpay - customers pay at the end of the year Annual prepay - customers pay at the beginning of the year At months 12 and months 24, the startup’s cash position converges on the same point. But in between, there are huge differences in cash, particularly in the second year. It’s plain to see that annual prepay is the most advantageous position for the company, In the annual prepay scenario, the company generates negative working capital. Customers are financing the company’s growth by lending the startup money at effectively zero interest. The startup can take that capital and double down on growth if it makes sense for the business, a luxury the other parallel financial universes don’t allow. To accomplish this transition from monthly payment, for example, to annual prepayment requires retraining of the sales team and also perhaps adjusting the sales compensation plan. But it can be done. Wildfire moved from a campaign billing model to an annual prepay model over the course of three months and during that time period moved 80% of revenue to prepayment. Needless to say, this small initiative had a disproportionate impact on the financial health and the consequent growth trajectory of the business. Managing  cash collections and structuring sales contracts are some of the most impactful initiatives a SaaS company can undertake to maximize their chances of success, particularly in the early days of the company’s life. Thanks to Derek Draper who inspired this post.

At an Internet of Things conference last week, I took part in a panel in which we discussed the future of connected devices. Will simple products win or will complex products dominate in the IoT?, we were asked. I think the question misses the point and raises another problem about the Internet of Things more broadly. It’s not about Things. It’s about Services. Software-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service. Simplicity and complexity are two sides of the same coin. Great products are simple on the surface, but devote tremendous energy under the surface to handle complexity on behalf of the user. Great products are like ducks . Ducks are calm above the water despite paddling furiously below it. For Internet of Things products to be successful, user interfaces must be simple, just as in any other product. It’s table stakes. The complexity that lies underneath should be tucked away. That’s the problem with the name Internet of Things or connected devices. The majority of the user value isn’t about the things at all, but the services that power the things. In fact, the most successful connected devices should disappear from a user’s mind altogether. That the devices are connected at all or even exist should simply be forgotten. Most of the magical technology experiences hide complexity with simplicity in this way. Apple’s motto “it just works” captures the notion succinctly. Hail an Uber with the push of a button while a logistics and voting system finds the right driver. Photograph a receipt on Expensify and have the contents automatically transcribed for you. Dig through data on Looker, while a database creates the right queries to answer your question instantly. The promise of the internet of Things is a world where objects think on our behalf, what I’m calling anticipatory computing , for example checking into a flight automatically as I enter an airport terminal. Or an air conditioner that automatically changes its settings depending on the weather. In both those examples, technology disappears into the background, enabled by data. Data will lead the revolution. It will lead to a revolution in platforms that enable the collection and use of data, like Electric Imp. The data will lead to a revolution in the analysis of that data and consequently in the infrastructure from server to database to business intelligence suite, which is why 75% of companies surveyed by the Economist in 2013 are pursuing initiatives in the Internet of Things. While the initial winners in the IoT category will be consumer facing products, I suspect the vast majority of market value creation will happen behind the scenes, in service companies and database companies, analysis companies and platform companies to build products that the end-user will never see: the SaaS and PaaS products that enable magic to happen. When we achieve that vision of intertwining data and technology to transform connected devices into forgettable wallflowers, then the true promise of the Internet of Things will be realized, and the moniker will simply vanish because it will be meaningless. At that point, the real value will remain in the services behind the scenes processing terabytes of data to help people live better lives.

Fenwick’s report on the state of the venture market and I came across these three data points that summarise one facet of the market in Silicon Valley succinctly: 11 venture backed companies raised funds at a valuation of over $1 billion in Q114, more than did so in all of 2013. Hedge and mutual funds participated in 23 venture deals through mid-April, compared to 41 in all of 2013 Investment in later stage comprised 47% of all dollars invested in Q1, while Series A investment fell to a five quarter low at 15%. The late stage venture market has been booming spectacularly in Silicon Valley. This source of capital enabling companies to remain private longer and become larger before an IPO or sale. After reading the report, I became curious about the trends in the US broadly, so I ran three quick analyses on Crunchbase data. First, the median investment sizes by round are relatively constant for the earlier rounds (angel, series-a, series-b). But Series C+ have seen a steady growth over the past 8 years. This indicates the growth in the size of later rounds has been broadly felt. Second, as a share of the total venture dollars raised, growth rounds have been growing nearly monotonically, pushing the Series A and Series B share below 20% each. This implies that the lion’s share of venture dollars and in particular, the newer larger funds are invested in growth rounds. If the fundraising trends in Q1 continue for the year, VCs will raise twice as much capital in 2014 as 2013 ($36B vs $17B). The majority of those dollars will pursue late stage, pre-IPO opportunities rather than bolster the early stage market, provided the private market remain relatively insulated from the correcting consumer and enterprise companies in the public market. Third, geographic concentration seems to be increasing. San Francisco has seen a meteoric rise of share of venture dollars invested, growing from less than 10% to more than 20% last year. Curiously, Palo Alto’s share has skyrocketed, driven by one investment in particular: the Cloudera $750M round. So, the recent decline in SF’s share of dollars seems to be an aberration. New York has also been growing steadily. The venture market is changing rapidly. Mega-rounds are now part of the modern venture landscape. Geographic concentrations are shifting. Startups are becoming larger and larger. I suspect there will be a retrenchment in later stage investments both in the Bay Area and across the US more broadly. It’s still unclear to me how this growth investment market correction will impact earlier stage investments. Most of the Q1 data predates the February public market correction. Q2 will be an important bellwether to gauge the bullishness of the venture industry for 2014.

In this week’s New Yorker, Jill Lepore reviews Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace , a book whose author asks the question, what is the work place of the future? The information worker is a relatively new concept. Peter Drucker coined the term in the 50s. By then companies had already developed new ways of housing information workers. The very first information workers were accountants hunched over “Bob Crachit” desks in the back rooms of factories. Booming railroad companies demanded more organization and created offices within the new skyscrapers along the Chicago skyline. With these new offices came stacks of paper and folios, and cabinets in which to file them. Then, the Mad Men wrought an era of typewriters and mahogany corner offices. Next, Bell Labs invented the suburban office park, moving offices from the city as part of post-war suburbanization and in the 70s, Herman Miller crafted the now-ubiquitous cubicle, which was called the “Action Office” when it launched. Oh, the irony. Throughout these eras described in the book, four parameters characterize each period: office location, the tools used within the office, the layout of the office and the vibe. How are these evolving for today’s workers? In the Bay Area, San Francisco is exerting a strong gravitational pull on startups and has arguably become the nucleus of the Bay Area. The dictaphones, typewriters, mimeograph machines and desktop computers of yore have been replaced by standing desks adorned with Apple Cinema Displays, bike racks hang from the joists in hallways,  exposed brick and beam has replaced sheetrock and plaster, and conference rooms have become smaller often connected to the world by video conferencing. Gone are the cubicled Action Offices, replaced by open floor plans, which are now seemingly a thing of the past . The most prominent change, though, is vibe. To see what I mean, sit in the log cabins adorning the 5th floor of the Twitter offices, or lounge in the heavy industry, hexagon-decked metallic kitchen of the HeavyBit incubator, or the mushroom conference room at AirBnB. Vibe is the embodiment of a company’s culture in furniture, food and decor. Vibe is a recruiting tool, a PR weapon and a competitive advantage.  Vibe is so important for Heroku that the founders hired a Chief Vibe Officer. The use of the workplace in this way is novel. I suspect laptops and mobile phones will also change the way we craft and construct our workplaces. I suspect we’ll see many smaller conference rooms in offices than we have in the past. Also, because of the combination of mobility and urbanization, much more work will be completed outside the office in cafes and parks and home. It’s fascinating to trace the arc of our workplaces and the impact our tools and work have on the places we spent most of our lives in. Increasingly, the four walls that surround us are embodiments of our values.

Yesterday, I spoke on a panel at the Gainsight Pulse conference with Aaron Ross, the author of Predictable Revenue , Jason Lemkin of Storm Ventures who authors SaaStr , and Brian Stafford, a customer success expert from McKinsey. It was great fun to be on the panel and discuss how customer success is transforming SaaS companies by increasing revenue growth, decreasing capital needs, building better products and consequently retaining more customers. I’ve embedded my slides below. Many customer success leaders were present and I had a great time chatting with a few to understand the state of the market. To summarize the zeitgeist, customer success leaders in the session and throughout the conference voiced four challenges/problem/questions they face today: education, justification, attribution, and team structure. Gainsight Pulse Presentation by Tom Tunguz Customer success (CS) within SaaS startups is a relatively new idea. Consequently, the benefits of CS aren’t widely appreciated within the ecosystem which means in many companies, customer success teams must educate management teams about the impact they can effect on an organization. This can be a long process. The most salient misunderstanding about CS is that customer success is a revenue generating team, not a cost-center. In addition to mitigating churn, CS teams increase account revenue, which in many SaaS companies, can grow to be multiples of the first year’s customer value. By dramatically increasing CLV, CS teams can actually generate as much more or more revenue than sales teams over the life of a customer. Part and parcel of the education process is justification. Customer success teams must justify the investment of building a CS team, often at the expense of headcount in another team. Constrained by headcount budgets and burn requirements, startup leadership teams often must choose between hiring an additional sales person or investing in a customer success person, for example. Because the early and fast revenue growth of early stage startups can mask churn and because the impact of a customer success team is most often seen during renewal windows which can be many months away, arguing for additional CS headcount at the expense of immediate, revenue generating salespeople is an uphill battle. Once granted approval to build the CS team, a customer success manager must decide the structure of the team including reporting lines, compensation and collaboration with other departments. I believe CS teams should have a say in the types of customers sales teams pursue, because CS teams often own renewal rates and a key part of customer retention is sourcing the right customers at the top of the funnel. A customer success leader must also craft a compensation plan to incent the team to retain customers and grow accounts in the right way for the business. Key to creating the right compensation plan is measuring the success of the team…which is the fourth challenge. Last, the CS team must measure its performance, which raises the question, how to properly attribute the efforts of different teams to growth in a customer’s value. In the words of an audience member, “What are the best ways for a CS team to measure its impact on the renewal or upsell rate?” Attribution is a challenge faced by marketing and sales teams already. It’s no surprise that CS teams should also wrestle with this idea. I suggested AB testing, though I’m certain there are much better methods. Though well known to other industries characterized by slow market growth and intense competition including financial services and carriers, customer success is relatively new for fast-growth SaaS companies. Despite the initial challenges facing customer success teams, I’m excited about the innovations to come in customer success in the next few years. Companies at the forefront of customer success will benefit disproportionately from their investment with faster growth, happier customers and better capital efficiency.

Startups are in a state of perpetual change. During a startup’s first few years of establishing product market and winning the first set of customers, this state of change is obvious. But as a startup scales, the company must adapt by learning and reinventing. Whether it’s building the processes to grow the team, creating new sales and marketing initiatives to pursue adjacent customers, developing customer success teams or handling an unforseen crisis, this process of reacting to the market and evolving the company happens at every level in each function. How does a startup team steel itself to persevere through the ups and downs? Through combination of ruthlessness and grit. I’m not using ruthlessness in the totalitarian sense, but in an introspective, brutally honest sense . Founder/CEO of Constant Contact, Gail Goodman said it best You have to face yourself. You have to be unbelievably ruthless about what’s working and what’s not working. As CEO, you will have to change hundreds of times to face the different challenges in the different stages your business will go through. As a startup grows, each role within the company will change dramatically through the arc of the business. To persist through those changes the company and market demand of a team requires grit, a subject that Carol Dweck, a researcher at Stanford, has studied extensively. In her words, Grit is the disposition to pursue very long-term goals with passion and perseverance. And I want to emphasize the stamina quality of grit. Grit is sticking with things over the long term and then working very hard at it. And the key to grit is mindset. Dweck observed two different mindsets in her research : a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. A fixed mindset implies a belief that intelligence is static; people are born talented and gifted, and those characteristics are immutable. A growth mindset holds that one’s ability to learn can be improved with effort. Our ability to learn can change with time and that the problems we face are puzzles, opportunities to learn, rather than tools to reinforce intelligence. In other words, the mind has a plasticity, a flexibility, an ability to evolve. I’ve reproduced a graphic contrasting the two mental models below: My mental model for a startup team’s successful evolution is a feedback loop of ruthless honesty and growing through grit. In other words, candor about what’s working and what isn’t, coupled to a commitment to learn and evolve over long periods of time. I’m curious if others have a different mental model they use when thinking about a startup’s evolution. Let me know in the comments.

Predictability is sexy. Startups that have tuned their growth engines well enough to accurately forecast their growth, presuming these growth rates are attractive, will command much higher valuations in the market, simply because there is less risk in the company. As a result, investors prize these companies disproportionately. The challenge with predictability is predictability isn’t an end state. A business doesn’t become predictable one day and remain in that state in perpetuity. Rather, predictability is a discipline that must be practiced by managers and management teams within startups. Further complicating things, predictability is a product of many different teams’ efforts. Engineering and product teams set goals and deliver products on time . Marketing teams seek to generate sufficient marketing qualified leads (MQLs) to enable sales teams to achieve their sales quotas. Human resources must create a process to hire the right people when the business needs them. As Peter Drucker said, “you can’t manage what you can’t measure.” The same is true for predictability. Andy Grove, the former President of Intel, and author of one of my favorite management books , wrote about a technique for measuring predictability in his book, High Output Management , called the Stagger Chart. I’ve produced a hypothetical stagger chart for a fictional SaaS company’s revenue above. Along the horizontal axis is the forecast for each month. Along the vertical axis, are the months in which a forecast was made. Making this a bit more tangible, the second line, the February line with the numbers 36*, 41, 47, 60 and 75 is the four month forecast made in February. In February, the company generated $36k in revenue and the management team predicted $41k in March revenue, $47M in April revenue and so on. This chart tells the reader three things: The actual revenue growth for the business. The numbers in red with asterisks are actual figures. Looking down a column tells the reader how the forecasts for a particular month have changed with time. For example, March’s forecasts became stronger with time. June, on the other hand, fell with time. When the forecasts fall out of line, as they have in June, something is wrong or some key expectation hasn’t borne out, and the team should investigate the cause for the deviation. These types of charts can be applied to most activities of a startup including sales dollars, new customers, marketing leads, hires, churn….the list goes on. By asking for predictions and then retrospectively evaluating the predictions and how they change with time, management can ingrain more predictability into the business, and also develop a toolkit to find some of the leading indicators of changes within the business.

Has there been optimal time of year to raise a seed round? The chart above shows the number of seed rounds by quarter of the year from 2009-2013. At first blush, it would seem that the first quarter of the year is the most attractive period to raise a seed round. But that’s a faulty conclusion. First, there’s no statistical difference between the number of rounds raised in each quarter, according to a t-test on the four years of Crunchbase data I tested. Second, there is a meaningful difference in the size of rounds by quarter. The chart below depicts the mean and median size of seed rounds by quarter. Interestingly, seed rounds in Q4 are on average up to 15% larger, and in median are up to 60% larger than Q1. The t-test shows a p-value of 0.00012, meaning the difference compared to Q1 is statistically signifcant. But the difference between quarters 2, 3 and 4 aren’t material. Digging one level deeper, I’ve charted the distribution of seed rounds by investment size below. This data spans the last 4 complete years. Q1 is the least attractive quarter in which to raise a seed round. Of those companies who do raise a round, the median and average round size is smaller in Q1. Possible reasons for this trend? I wonder if there isn’t an investor dynamic where investors are more cautious at the beginning of the year and less so at the end. Much like media buyers who look to spend their excess budget at the end of year, investors may be looking to hit their dollar investment targets. Secondly, there might be some material differences in the time of year that startups are founded which would impact their fund raising timing and change the competitive dynamic during the course of the year. Last, it may be a statistical aberration caused by some indeterminate factor in the data. It’s important to note the data doesn’t give us any indication of fundraising success rate. I don’t know how many companies tried to raise and didn’t succeed or the fraction of companies who raised but didn’t achieve their total round size target. That data would help us understand the degree to which competition influences round sizes over the year. On the whole, Q1 does seem to yield smaller seed investments than other quarters during the year.

Some of the best content to be found about startups is locked in books. Thomas Kjemperud asked me yesterday for a 140 character recommendation of one book for founders. Reducing my list to just one and condensing an argument for why founders ought to read it in just 117 characters was just too great a challenge for me. Instead I’ve written a blog post about the nine favorite books I’ve read over the last five years have helped me understand startups and the processes that make them successful. They range from written 70 years ago to written in the past 3 years. They have been written by salespeople, CTOs, speechwriters, consultants and magnates. These are the books I go back to, time and again, when I have a question or I’m looking for an insight. If they weren’t all e-books, they would be dog-eared and foxed. Here they are: How to Castrate a Bull describes the creation and dramatic success of NetApp, the storage company. Unlike most business stories which are penned from the point of view of the CEO, this one is written by the CTO/founder, David Hitz. Hitz lived on a ranch in his youth and draws parallels between the activities on the ranch, like castrating bulls (!), and building a startup. For example, from Hitz’s point of view, politics is the art of getting groups of people to come to a common conclusion by developing consensus. Consensus is a state where all are willing to provide their consent for a decision to take place - not necessarily reaching total agreement, but allowing for the process to go forward. Other chapters focus on risk, including evaluating the risk of entering new markets, of changing corporate culture and attitudes, and of changing CEOs. The Essential Drucker condenses the extensive writings of Peter Drucker, one of the most respected management thinkers of the last century. I’ve written posts about his views on Communication , Optimal Team Sizes , The Myth of the Generalist , a team member’s Obligation to Dissent . Drucker coined the term information worker and presaged the changing nature of work resulting from people managing data instead of machines. Despite the age of his writings, many of his insights ring true today. Business Model Generation proposes a visual technique for creating and understanding business models for companies. Each time I meet with a company, I write down the BMG framework in my notebook and fill it in.  The BMG is clear and simple but comprehensive. The book also includes many examples of successful companies’ models which helped me understand those companies better. But for founders, it’s a good technique to think through different ideas. Predictable Revenue is the classic SaaS sales handbook. Written by Aaron Ross, one of the first salespeople at Salesforce, Predictable Revenue is one of the first books to describe the inside sales model with sales development teams, inside sales reps and account executives, and the processes that unify them into one coherent performant organization. Some of the techniques described in this book have since been outmoded, but the broad principles still apply. The Success Equation describes a mental model for risk. I heard about this book because David Lee from SV Angel wrote about it. I read it and I loved the concept.  when we make decisions, particularly business decisions, our goal is always to maximize the expected value of an investment. But the expected value is a combination of both skill and luck.  Playing a match of chess, I have a 50% chance of winning because both sides start out as equal. That’s the luck part. But if I were to play against the Grand Master, the skill part would become much more important. Understanding this equation, the importance of skill and luck in each major decision involving risk helps us to ensure we are making the right calls. It’s a quick read but a fascinating book that forced me to reflect on my decision-making processes for investments. To Sell is Human who is a former speechwriter for Al Gore penned this book to proclaim dead the hard sale. Pink’s book argues that the most successful salespeople today, unlike 30 years ago, are the ones who listen to customer needs and match a product’s features and functionality to serve those needs.  With a huge volume of information about different products at their disposal, today’s customers are far more sophisticated and consequently demand a different sales process. This book made me  reflect on the right characteristics of a salesperson within a company that is pursuing an education sale versus an execution sale . Like Peter Drucker, Peter Senge is another extraordinary management thinker. In his book, The Fifth Discipline , Senge Describes the four principles that have been well covered in management science before: team learning, shared vision, mental models and personal skills mastery.  But the fifth one, the one the book is named after, is Senge’s stroke of genius: systems thinking. Systems thinking, despite its esoteric name is actually quite simple. Systems thinking means looking at a business as a collection of positive and negative feedback loops. Virality is a positive feedback loop. Poor customer support experience leading to churn is a negative feedback loop. Senge argues that management teams ought to consistently develop an understanding of the feedback loop that govern their business and manage those loops actively. High Output Management is Andy Grove’s seminal work on management. It is the origin for the practice of OKRs, the management technique that Intel and Google, among others, use to set goals for the company and align everyone in achieving those goals. Zero to One is the compilation of Blake Master’s notes from Peter Thiel’s Stanford class. There are some profound insights in the book. My favorite is the idea that entrepreneurs should develop a secret. A secret is not an unknown. Rather, it’s something just not widely believed to be achievable or feasible. In other words, it’s an insight, a thesis that isn’t widely held that creates a business opportunity.

Last week, we reviewed the state of the public SaaS market and observed the average company had lost 33% of its value from their highs. How have newly public consumer companies fared in the same environment and what does that mean for the tech industry broadly? I created a basket of most of the venture-backed consumer IPOs since 2010 and added bellwethers Facebook and Google. Above is a chart of these companies enterprise value (market cap minus cash) over the past six months. In that time period, the average public consumer company has fallen 25%. but this fall isn’t broadly distributed across categories. i bucketed each of the names into 8 categories: social, real estate, media, gaming, financial, ecommerce, consumer services,  and ad tech. social, real estate and gaming have seen the biggest gains, while financial and ad tech companies have suffered the biggest losses. Social has been powered by Facebook’s growth driven by their phenomenal mobile ad success, which is offsetting Twitter’s decline. Both Trulia and Zillow have made gains in the public markets, making real estate one of the only two entirely positive categories. Gaming includes only Zynga and traces that stocks growth in the past six months. I didn’t include King because the company has too few data points. The financial category suffered because of Green Dot’s implosion to negative enterprise value! and also because Xoom has declined in line with the market. BrightCove and RocketFuel have both lost > 25% from their highs and pushed the ad tech category lower. Below is a chart showing the difference from peak enterprise value by stock. The red line is the median loss across all names. Boingo and Zulily don’t show bars because they are currently at their six month highs. The consumer market hasn’t seen as significant compression as the internet names. Part of this difference is the enterprise-value-to-revenue multiples never reached the same highs as SaaS companies. The median EV-to-next-twelve-month revenue multiple across consumer today is 3.5, 30% lower than of the current SaaS market , so there was less room for the stocks to fall. But there is a correction nonetheless and that correction has impacted different categories of companies differently. Some of these changes are company specific, particularly in the case of the financial sector. But I suspect there are broader themes too: eg, positive ones for real estate and negative ones for ad tech. Overall, we’re seeing a broad correction in public tech valuations.

At a board meeting last week, one of the VPs of Marketing I’m lucky to work with presented a brilliantly simple way of explaining the evolution of a startup’s marketing tactics. I’ve drawn a diagram of the idea above, which borrows heavily from McKinsey’s 3 horizons . Startups have many different marketing options at their disposal: SEO/SEM, print, radio, TV, mail, affiliate, content marketing…The list goes on and on. Faced with this litany of options, how does a startup maximize their marketing effectiveness? Initially, a startup’s goal is to find a channel with profitable unit economics (where the cost-of-customer-acquisition is less than the gross margin over some lifetime-value estimate) with as small an investment as possible to minimize burn. To find that viable acquisition channel requires lots of testing, so fast testing cycles of different advertising tactics are paramount to determining the viability of a channel. Fast iteration cycles tend to be at the bottom-of-the-funnel, when potential customers are at the point of purchase. Typically, when startups get started startups experiment and pursue success in direct-response advertising including cost-per-click, cost-per-lead, cost-per-install and other forms of performance advertising. These channels can offer quite a bit of volume and can enable a company to grow to some scale. But as the startup begins to saturate the marketing channel, the unit economics of the channel stabilize or potentially worsen. Next, the startup begins to expand to more and more direct response advertising channels and pursue the same strategy. At a certain point, the marginal returns of continued investment in bottom-of-the-funnel customer acquisition strategies begins to winnow. Before such a point occurs, the startup should move up the funnel and begin to experiment with middle-of-the-funnel tactics, where potential customer leads are educated and nurtured. Moving up the funnel implies addressing a broader universe of new customers at the expense of longer customer-conversion times and a decreased ability to measure the effectiveness of a dollar of marketing spend. But, having built the systems and processes to measure the effectiveness of performance advertising, a startup is in a much better position to evaluate middle-of-the-funnel advertising, like content marketing, lifecycle-marketing and others. Last, having built the middle-of-the-funnel channels and begun to measure and tune these channels then enables the startup to move to address the top-of-the-funnel, to build broad awareness of the company with products like billboards, radio and TV, etc. Again, because the startup has instrumented the middle and bottom of the funnel, the impact of top-of-the-funnel can be measured, to a certain extent. Said another way, at its outset, a startup should focus on customers who will convert in 30 days, focus on those channels and master them. Once a playbook has been established, then a startup should aim to reach ever broader audiences with riskier (or less measurable) channels, first in the middle of the funnel and then the top of the funnel. In this way, a startup can match the growth needs and the predictability needs of each type of marketing channel with the needs of the startup, namely the ability to grow and also demonstrate compelling unit economics and repeatable growth, the cornerstone of successful fundraising.

Earlier this week, I wrote about the increase in cash compensation and decline in equity grants to VPs of Engineering and Product in startups . I received a lot of comments about the analysis, and in particular hypotheses to explain the data. I dug a bit deeper into the data set to find an explanation. Founding employees keep more equity today than ever through the Series A and Series B. On average, founders retain 30-33% more equity than 4 years ago through those first two rounds of institutional investment. For the statisticians out there, this change is statistically significant with greater than 99% confidence on an average yearly sample size about 200+ data points per year per role. The chart above shows the trends in four graphs. The graphs are broken out by last Series of investment (A, B, C and D) and show the equity compensation trends of CEOs, VP of Engineering and VP of Product. The gray shadows around the lines represent the 95% confidence intervals. In 2014, the median founding CEO equity stake after raising a Series A is 21% up from 15% in 2009. The trend is similar for Series B companies. On the whole, the founder stakes for founding VPEng and VPProduct have remained relatively stable. The much higher variances of equity stakes for these two positions make it difficult to draw a statistically significant conclusion about trends. Let’s compare founder equity trends with non-founders, in the chart below. Non-founder equity grants have remained relatively constant over time, with a recent spike in post-Series A CEO compensation apparent in the last year. If the capitalization table of a startup has 100%, and the compensation for founders is increasing and the compensation for non-founders is staying constant, whose share is contracting? Venture capitalists. Pitchbook’s Q4 Series A and B valuation data , copied below, shows a greater than 44% increase in median startup valuations during the same time period as the compensation study above. But Crunchbase data indicates that round sizes have remained relatively constant. So, on the whole, as valuations in startupland have increased, investors have held their check size relatively constant and consequently, founders are retaining more equity in their businesses.

What a difference three weeks make! Since I wrote “ The Correction in SaaS Company Valuations ”, SaaS company valuations have continued to fall. As a basket, SaaS companies have fallen 33% from their highs (median), wiping all the gains for the last year. To make that point more explicit, below I’ve charted the total value of public SaaS companies over the last ten months. In that time period, the aggreggate enterprise value has fallen from greater than $150B to $117B today. And these share price decreases have been distributed across all the basket of SaaS companies. Below is the distribution of share price changes from the 10-month highs, which doesn’t quite follow a uniform distribution, but shows that only one stock is currently at its 10 month high. The others are off on average about 30%. It would be hard to claim the underlying businesses have worsened since February. To my knowledge, none of these SaaS companies growth trajectories have changed nor has the business environment entered a less fruitful period. Netsuite , Marketo , ServiceNow have each announced better than consensus earnings. Why is the correction happening then? I believe it’s a reversion to the mean. Public institutional investors are rotating from growth stocks to value stocks , because growth stocks multiples have far exceeded long term norms.  Let’s look at the ratio of Total Enterprise Value (TEV) to Next-Twelve Months’ (NTM) Revenue during the past ten months. The chart below shows that data. The ratio grew from 6x to 8x before falling to 5.3x in April. Let’s put those figures into historical context. Over ten years, the median TEV/NTM Revenue, the blue line, has been 4.9x, the black line, far below the 7-8x of recent months. During the financial crisis, that number fell, but a year later SaaS companies suddenly began to appreciate dramatically in value. Throughout these past ten years, and despite the fact that the basket of stocks has changed, the median has been 4.9x. At their lowest point in 2009, the basket reached 2.8x. I think it’s unlikely we touch the lows marking the financial crash. Because the publicly traded SaaS companies continue to grow and because the economic environment is relatively stable, I’d argue the multiples will revert to right around the median, in the 4-5x range. This data supports Jason Lemkin’s contention that SaaS valuations could fall by up to 50% , if the public and private markets move in tandem. There are a few important implications of these corrections, much of which Jason touches on in his post: Private market valuations for SaaS companies will likely decrease for most companies in the short term and the sizes of the rounds raised will follow suit. Because cash will become more expensive, some companies may choose to pursue slower growth, lower burn rate models. Some startups may face valuation-to-revenue mismatches when/if they need to raise follow on rounds. But there will still be a class of outliers which are able to command premium valuations and multiples when raising capital because the market opportunities afforded to certain SaaS categories are so massive, that the disruptive capability of these companies will remain prized in the market. M&A prices may decline, but I’m not sure M&A activity will fall. The stocks of public SaaS companies have fallen in value so their purchasing power and willingness-to-pay has diminished. But the cash balances of Microsoft ($87B), Oracle($37B),  HP($14B), IBM ($10B), and SAP ($5B) haven’t changed. These behemoths will continue to purchase growth in strategic sectors through M&A. This reversion to the mean is a healthy evolution of the SaaS market. Multiples couldn’t expand forever and instead of a run-up and a collapse, we’re observing a large orderly market correction in the public markets. Thanks to Brian Cayne and Josh Stein, who inspired this post.

Since 2008, there has been a secular trend to increase cash compensation and decrease equity to startup management teams. Tho two tables below tell the story for VPs of Engineering (VPE) and VPs of Product (VPP) across the US broadly and in the SF Bay Area. VPE US SF Cash +10% +16% Equity -19% -17% VPP US SF Cash +26% +8% Equity -31% -25% In the past 5 years, VPEs have benefitted from a 10 to 16% increase in their cash compensation, but have seen their equity grants fall by 17-19%. The same pattern holds true for VPPs: an 8-26% increas in cash and a 25-30% drop in equity grants. Above, I’ve charted the cash compensation trends, (salary+bonus), for the different roles and different locations. The Bay Area (marked as SF) is in red; the US is in blue. Below is the same chart for equity. I’m using a data set that polls the compensation of several hundred venture backed companies in this analysis. I’ve chosen to use non-founder data, in other words, executives who have been hired into startups, because that market has more liquidity and should reflect true market prices better. Why is this happening? The recent larger investments in startups could make them more cash rich and therefore more generous with cash than equity. Increases in cost of living in different regions might compel new hires to ask for a greater cash/equity split to offset inflation in living costs. Or there might be some bias in the data set towards later stage companies whose success more assured. To determine the real cause requires more analysis. Nevertheless, startups across the US and across different management positions have meaningfully changed their compensation structures to favor cash over equity in the past five years.

The chart above compares the contribution of two hypothetical inside sales people with $400,000 quotas to an early-stage startup’s finances. In this case, contribution is the 18 month revenue of sold customers tallied cumulatively minus the salary costs of $100k annualized of the sales person. I’ve modeled a six month linear ramp for the sales person to reach 100% of quota. The red line shows the case for a successful sales hire. Through the first three months, as the salesperson ramps, his contribution to the business is negative because his salary costs outweigh the lifetime value of his sales. Note, I haven’t included the recruiting costs here, just wages and commission. Starting in the fourth month, new customers closed by the salesperson begin to offset his costs and by month 5, the company is better-than-breakeven on the hiring decision on a customer lifetime value basis. The blue line shows the impact of the bad hire. The wrong person is initially hired and fired in month 3 and immediately thereafter, a successful candidate is found. Because the startup must incur the quota ramp again, the contribution dips 2x lower than in the success case, about -$20k in month 5, and the investment on sales hiring isn’t recouped until 8 months after the initial hire. This stutter-step also has an impact on the revenue trajectory of the business as shown by the chart above. The hypothetical failed sales hire delays the revenue of the business by 3 months. As a company’s revenues grow and the number of people within the salesteam increases, these effects become less and less important. But at the beginning, the impact to the trajectory of a business can be material. In addition to the unquantifiable costs to company culture and moral, there are three quantifiable costs of a bad sales hire: The additional recruiting costs and time of finding a new person The opportunity cost of not having converted active leads into revenue The delay in the revenue growth of the business

One of the key metrics that I don’t think gets enough notice when reviewing the health of a SaaS business is revenue-at-risk or RaR. For SaaS businesses with quarterly or annual contracts, each month some subset of the customer base’s contracts must be renewed. The RaR is the sum of the revenue from these customers in a given month or quarter. RaR is a useful measure because it captures the company’s opportunity to minimize lost customer revenue. Identifying customers at risk and proactively engaging them, cultivating a relationship and providing them account support can meaningfully improve a SaaS company’s churn rates. I’ve seen two ways to calculate RAR: a probabilistic method and a customer-by-customer method. The probabilistic method multiplies the MRR by the historical monthly revenue churn rate. That figure is multiplied by 12 to annualize it. Probablistic_RAR = MRR x Revenue_Churn_Rate x 12 The probabilistic RAR is top-down, so isn’t as accurate as the bottoms-up method. For example, some customers may have previously expressed a desire to renew, in which case their contribution to RAR should be excluded. The probabilistic RAR has a tendency to over-estimate the figure, but it’s useful as a back-of-the-envelope figure. The more accurate method, customer-by-customer RAR, requires each account manager or salesperson to keep accurate records in a CRM about a customer’s likelihood to churn. If that data is accurate, calculating the customer-by-customer RAR involves summing the revenue of those likely-to-churn customers by month. Once RaR is measured, then the company can begin to measure RaR-save-rate, the fraction of RaR that is prevented from churning through the efforts of the customer success and/or sales teams. CbC_RAR = Σ Customers_Revenue_at_Risk It’s important to state that RAR isn’t constant throughout the year. RAR fluctuates depending on customer contract renewal schedules and fluctuations in sales teams bookings activity. Because of the variance throughout the year, understanding Revenue-at-Risk is important for four reasons. First, RaR estimates help with cash-planning to ensure achievement of a target growth rate . Second, revenue-at-risk projections should be used to inform customer success staffing . Third, RAR-save-rate can be employed as a benchmark of a customer success team’s effectiveness throughout the year. Fourth, RAR is a tool to measure the effectiveness of the sales team in selecting the right customers to pitch. Revenue-at-risk is an important metric to monitor for SaaS startups particularly as they scale. Initially, when churn rates are small, implementing the systems to measure RaR may seem excessive. But as revenues grow, sales teams swell and customer accounts multiply, SaaS startups must able to estimate and manage churn effectively. For some code to generate a chart of Revenue-at-Risk, see this blog post .

Pricing is one of the hardest things for startups to get right because there is no universal and constant price optimum. As a SaaS startup’s product evolves and offers more features, the product’s price points should increase. As a sales team or marketing team engages different customer segments, price points may vary wildly. The contract for a F500 should have very different pricing than a startup , because of the stark contrast in the different companies’ willingness to pay and value associated with buying the product.  When competitors influence the market place, price points may change. Conferences, seasonality, news events, business development relationships, sales promotions all may impact pricing. Given the dynamic pricing environment, the most effective way I’ve found to pursue the right pricing is to test constantly and then compare different prices’ effectiveness at maximizing customer lifetime value. This is the process I’ve been using to benchmark different price points. Determining if Price Points Impact Revenue Within a one customer segment or across the entire customer population, divide the segment into two groups and sell at two different price points for a period of time that creates enough data to be statistically significant. My rough rule of thumb from statistics class is 30 in each bucket. Track these cohorts through the first renewal period, or multiple renewal periods, to measure revenue churn rate. Calculate expected value of a customer for each price experiment. The expected value I use is: revenue_from_initial_term+revenue_from_second_term x conversion_rate_for_segment - cost_to_sell_initial_period - cost_to_serve_all_time - costs_to_trigger_renewal_second_term - discounts/incentives/other This formula can be expanded to include as many renewal periods as the data allows. Use Student’s T-Test to determine if the means of the expected values across the different price experiments differ. In practice, I use a p-value of < 0.01 as a measure of determining if one pricing model is better than another.  In Excel, this command is TTEST() . In R, it’s t.test() . Graph the data on a boxplot to double check the distributions and make sure the conclusions make sense. This is my quick and dirty method for drawing conclusions from company data about which pricing models are working. Searching Google, I came across quite a few products that do this on the Salesforce App Exchange, but I haven’t seen many of these applications in the wild. I’m curious if other people have developed methods to test pricing for SaaS products across different segments that are more sophisticated or more automated.

Tien Tzuo, the founder and CEO of Zuora* and former CSO/CMO at Salesforce, knows SaaS businesses better than most. So when he pens an opinion about the subscription economy, a term which I believe he coined, I read it with great interest. Yesterday, Tien wrote “These Numbers Show That Box CEO Aaron Levie Is A Genius” , explaining Box’s business and growth in great detail. In the post, Tien argues two important points. First, current accounting practices don’t properly reflect the health of recurring revenue businesses, like Box. A dollar from a recurring enterprise costumer with a multi-year lifetime value is worth much more than a dollar from a one-time transaction, like buying a digital apple in an iPhone game. Because SaaS companies can forecast the revenue from existing customers with great accuracy, these businesses can make deeper and longer term investments than transactional businesses. The image below shows Zuora’s take on the income statement for a subscription business, which uses ARR, not revenue as the key metric. Second, there is a mismatch between an investment in Sales and Marketing and the revenue created by that investment. This image from David Skok’s great blog on Saas companies proves the point: The ROI for a large sales and marketing investment, say doubling a sales team, won’t be apparent for two years and will depress the sales productivity numbers and the margins of a SaaS business when using traditional accounting. Fast-growing SaaS companies like Box bet the deep trough of low margins and huge burn will eventually translate into enormous revenues over time with very strong ROI. In my analysis of the Box S-1 , I found the Box sales efficiency metrics registered at the bottom of the cohort. What the numbers don’t say is if that sales efficiency metric is for a fully ramped sales team. But if Box decided last year to increase the sales team by 40%, 40% of the sales teams in the company would still be operating at something like 50% of their quota, thereby depressing this metric. Tien’s point is that the true health of a SaaS business isn’t properly communicated with the accounting systems we have in place today. I agree with him and hope that we can move to a new, more accurate set of metrics akin to the ARR-based income statement Tien proposes as a way of comparing and contrasting companies with subscription business models. Redpoint are investors in Zuora

When the meeting first appeared on my calendar, I incredulous at the idea of a management coach. “A business shrink who would sap another hour from my frenetic day,” I thought. I was a few months into being a product manager at Google and stressed because I was in over my head. Most difficult of all, I lacked any type of formal authority. Google structured its product teams to have authority through influence, not direct management of engineering teams or marketing teams or sales teams. The brilliance of the engineers, marketers and salespeople I worked with amplified this challenge. We were all holding each other to very high standards. I walked into my first meeting with my management coach frazzled with the demands of the PM job and frustrated to be allocating an hour to the meeting. Unprepared, without an agenda, I introduced myself and sat down, not without an air of arrogance. Within the first five minutes, the coach had completely disarmed me. Her tool of choice: the open-ended question. How are you? Where do you want to be in a few years? What are you struggling with at work? How do you want to improve? With that series of questions and knowing that she had no agenda other than to help me and listen to me, she had made an ally of me and over time, I became a more effective and happier PM. During those sessions, I began to understand the impact of an unbiased, agenda-less observer - in other words a coach.  It was easy for me to be open with her and share my worries about my shortcomings as a product manager. There were no negative consequences of admitting them because everything we shared was held in confidence. My coach brought fresh eyes to problems, asked basic questions and pulled apart the challenges I brought to her each week. Because she wasn’t familiar with the inner-workings of the company, the people, the interpersonal dynamics, or the technology, I was forced to explain the situation, an exercise which often helped me put to words how I was feeling or dealing with the situation. These summaries also revealed the solutions: simplify, simplify. When presented with one of my problems, she would equip me with simple frameworks for structuring important presentations to the executive team (clear - describe the slide, content - deliver the content, transition - set up the next slide), sharing difficult feedback to co-workers, and techniques for effective delegation. I use many of them today. It’s been seven years since my first meeting with my management coach and I still see her and consult her with my challenges from time-to-time. A fresh perspective from a skilled unbiased friend/coach can be refreshing and insightful. It’s an investment well worth making, even for the most time-constrained people.

Last week, we proved SaaS startups are raising more than they have in the past and newer SaaS companies seem to be generating more revenue per dollar invested . But do newer SaaS companies actually spend less on sales and engineering than their older counterparts? In fact, the 2014 cohort of public SaaS companies spend more on sales & marketing and engineering than previous IPO cohorts. But this increased spend results in faster revenue growth and consequent higher revenue. I’ve prepared three charts and one table to compare the sales and engineering spending across different cohorts of companies over time, and the resultant effect on revenue growth. The chart above, Sales Spend as a % of Revenue and Median Sales Costs depicts the percent of revenue allocated to sales and marketing over the life of the company, by IPO cohort. Because startups are going public earlier and therefore release information about the earlier years of the company, we have more data on the newer cohorts. While we can’t make comparisons about the early years of startup sales spend across cohorts, it’s plain to see that across the past 4 IPO cohorts, sales spending eventually converges to about 50%. There’s no clear difference, then, in sales spending. Looking at the Median Sales Costs, which shows gross sales dollars in $M, the 2014 cohort does show accelerated spending compared to older cohorts. In combination with the chart above, these data points imply that greater sales investments generate more revenue than in the past. The engineering spend story is similar, but greater in magnitude. Newer companies have invested substantially more in engineering as a percentage of their revenue than their older counterparts. This may be because larger round sizes enable the creation of larger engineering teams earlier. It may also be because the pace of innovation has increased and fending off competitors means persistently building more products. I’m not sure, but the trend is real on a percentage basis as well as on a dollars basis. Looking at the gross dollars invested in engineering, the 2014 cohort spends  much more than the 2010, 2006 and 2002 cohorts, setting aside one outlier year in the 2006 cohort. The median spend is about $10M more per year in the 2014 cohort, starting in year 6. Summing up these two charts, the 2014 cohorts do in fact spend more on sales and marketing than their predecessors, and earlier on in their lives. This increased spending is enabled by larger raises earlier in the company lifecycle and actually leads to faster revenue growth, as the graph below proves. The 2014 cohort has the steepest, most consistent growth curve of any of the cohorts. Leading the way, a handful of outliers are adopting increasingly efficient models. Below is a table of the most efficient companies by cohort, showing their sales and engineering spend. There seems to be a bumpy, but persistent decline. IPO Cohort Minimum Sales Spend % Rev Minimum Eng Spend % Rev 1998 34 11 2002 44 7 2006 41 4 2010 35 8 2014 27 6 The table does show the most efficient company in the 2014 cohort to have spent less on sales than any other IPO cohort winner. But in the 2006 cohort, DealerTrack spent only 4% on engineering investment, besting the 2014 engineering winner, Fleetmatics. In summary, the data shows that newer SaaS companies spend more on engineering and sales & marketing than ever before but that increasing efficiency in the sales models can justify that investment with faster revenue growth. The data don’t show us why the increases in spending in sales and engineering result in more revenue, but they do suggest that cost per sales is decreasing either because of decreased costs of customer acquisition or increased average contract value or some other reason. In any case, the result is quite encouraging.

If you visit Yahoo Finance today, type in the ticker of every SaaS stock, copy and paste the image into a document, you might create a chart that looks like the one above. A cursory glance at the plunging lines in most of these names might send you into a panic, only to tweet in alarm that the bottom is falling out of the SaaS market. Chicken little. Chicken little. The problem with the chart above is the y-axis. In the chart above, the data isn’t presented with the right perspective. The y-axis should go to zero at the bottom. Below is a chart that accurately shows the trends. Far less alarming. Nevertheless, there seems to be a correction impacting the public SaaS market. The median SaaS stock has fallen 23% from its high over the past 9 months. Every stock but LogMeIn has fallen in that period. Notably, Rally Software has fallen by 54% and Jive by about 56%. Despite this recent downward pressure, these SaaS companies have actually increased their value in the trailing nine month period by 21%, on average. Additionally, SaaS companies still command a 9x Enterprise Value-to-Revenue multiple, likely one of the most generous multiples of most sectors in the market. Whether this correction is a short term, aberration or long-term repricing is challenging to say. Regardless, SaaS companies are still darlings of the public markets.

I’ve been following Casey Johnston’s journey on Ars Technica to switch keyboard layouts from the ubiquitous Qwerty layout to the Dvorak layout with great interest and empathy. ( part 1 and part2 ).  About six years ago, I went through the same process to learn Dvorak. It took me five tries to succeed. Judging by the volume and passion of the comments in that series, keyboard layouts are a topic many people are pretty passionate about. I suspect it’s because we’re all trying to eke out a little more each day from ourselves. Like many others, I type volumes on my laptop: emails and blog posts, tweets and instant messenger. Frequently though, the tendinitis I suffered from as a rower in college flares up. So, I dictate emails often and use text expansion software which reduces recurring phrases to just three key strokes. For example, when I type ttt into this window TextExpander converts it to “Thanks for making the time to meet me.” Despite those countermeasures, I’ve still had problems. I knew that there was no conclusive research proving the Dvorak layout is faster. But organizing the most frequently used keys on the home row seemed logical to me because the distance each finger moves would be dramatically lessened and I hoped it might relieve some of the pain. I tried five times over six months to make the switch. Reading through Casey’s journeys reminds me of that transition time. Instant messages were the most frustrating part because I would chat with my wife or my friends and their expectation of response times were much faster than my typing. After about a month of 10-30 minute training sessions each morning, though, I was off and running. Today, I’m probably about the same speed as I was in my QWERTY days, but typing speed isn’t a competitive advantage in venture capital, so I think it’s fine. About a year later, I changed the layout on my mobile phone to Dvorak too, purely for consistency. For a while, it wasn’t hard to keep the layouts separate in my head. But now Qwerty seems foreign. Keyboard layouts don’t come up in conversation very frequently but when they do, I brace myself for a good laugh at my expense. Just saying the word Dvorak screams nerd. Luckily, it’s a rare topic of conversation. The only times people uncover my secret are when they glimpse the keyboard on my mobile phone or try to use my laptop and the letters on the screen don’t correspond to those on the keyboard. It’s not for everybody, but I’m glad I made the switch. But, I hope my switch will soon be in vain and in the very near future, keyboards disappear only to be  replaced by something much more elegant so none of us are inclined to debate which layout is better.

Last week, we analyzed the fund raising history of billion dollar SaaS companies and determined SaaS startups are raising nearly twice as much capital as 16 years ago before going public. Given that trend, I wondered if there is there any truth to the idea that startups today require less capital than before to succeed. To answer that question, I’ve taken the same basket of public SaaS companies and computed a revenue-on-invested-capital (ROIC) across the four 4-year IPO cohorts from 1998-2014. The revenue-on-invested-capital is the revenue at IPO divided by the venture dollars raised pre-IPO, inflation adjusted and measured in 2014 dollars. In other words, the efficiency score marks the number of venture dollars invested to generate one revenue dollar at IPO-time.* The line chart above shows the trend across the four different IPO cohorts from 1998-2014. The blue line shows the median ROIC and the red line shows the average ROIC. Before 2002, the median ROIC never exceeded 0.9. But afterwards, in both the 2006 and 2010 buckets, the median exceeded 1.15, indicating a remarkable increase in capital efficiency. The trend is more pronounced in the average metric which grew from 0.82 to 2.0 over the course of the same 16 years. Even more astounding, the number of companies in each bucket has increased, indicating that this increase in sales efficiency is broad-based. Also of note, there are more outliers in the recent cohorts. These outliers, which ROIC scores greater than three, have much more efficient sales models than the typical SaaS company. They include BazaarVoice, LinkedIn, Medidata, SolarWinds,Tableau and Veeva. All of those companies were in the latter two IPO cohorts. Below is the table of the data to show these trend in a bit more detail. IPO Cohort Average ROIC Median ROIC Count 1998 0.82 0.82 2 2002 1.05 0.88 6 2006 1.78 1.15 13 2010 2.00 1.24 15 The average revenue-on-invested-capital has more than doubled during the 16 years, while the median ROIC has increased by 50%. While a t-test fails to prove with statistical significance that SaaS businesses are more efficient, the trend is certainly pointing in the right direction. But the average and median are hiding an interesting phenomenon, a tale of two types of companies. Splitting the 2010 IPO cohort in two, the medians look very different. There’s a new breed of SaaS company that is far, far more capital efficient than ever before. Why? Over the past 16 years, the sales models for SaaS companies become better refined and startups have begun to benefit greatly from the reduced costs of building and deploying on cloud infrastructure. The resulting efficiencies have begun to shine in the financial statements and imply some terrifically successful and efficient SaaS businesses are yet to be built! *Because Veeva is such an outlier, having raised $4.3M (inflation adjusted) and having generated $210M in the trailing twelve months of its IPO earning it a ROIC of 59, I’ve removed it from the analysis.

One of the cloud’s great promise has been cost-reduction and for a while, we’ve chanted a mantra that startups require less capital than before to get started and ultimately succeed. As the number of publicly traded SaaS companies has grown with time, it’s possible today to examine whether those statements are proven in the data, at least for those 41 publicly traded companies. I’ve gathered the financing histories of the 41 publicly traded SaaS companies and adjusted them for inflation. The chart above shows the amount of capital raised in millions of 2014 dollars by each publicly traded SaaS company before going public. Click on the image to see a bigger copy. The blue vertical line is the median across this data set, $70M. The median doesn’t tell the story because the variance across the different companies is enormous. At the top end of the range, Box has raised more than $400M. At the bottom end, Veeva raised only $4M - a 100x disparity. So it’s clear there isn’t just one way to build a hugely valuable SaaS company. There’s more to the story, however. The table below compares the financing patterns of SaaS companies over time, in cohorts of 4 years. The first row contains data from IPOs between 1998-2002, the second bucket contains data from IPOs between 2002-2006 and so on.  These figures are inflation adjusted and are in 2014 dollars. IPO Cohort Median VC$ Raised Median # of Rounds Median Round Size $M Median IPO Size Number 1998 42 2.5 17 97 2 2002 71 3.0 24 86 7 2006 66 4.0 16 122 13 2010 101 4.5 22 137 18 From this table, we can identify five key trends: The number of SaaS IPOs has more than doubled in the past 12 years. t The number of rounds of financing each company raises before IPO has nearly doubled from 2.5 to 4.5, i.e. Series B/C to Series D/E. These figures exclude seeds, which I’ve defined as rounds less than $1.5M. The total amount of cash raised before IPO has doubled from the ‘98 cohort, adjusted for inflation. The median round sizes across the life of the company have remained relatively constant. IPO offerings have increased by about 40% in size In other words, the typical round size for SaaS companies hasn’t changed materially over the past 16 years but the number of rounds has doubled, which has doubled the amount of capital a startup raises in aggregate before IPO. At least on the surface, the data indicates SaaS companies aren’t more efficient. That pattern may be driven by an increasingly friendly financing environment or because of increased capital needs of the business or many other reasons. So the next question to answer is capital efficiency. In a future analysis, I’ll calculate the ratio of revenue dollars to VC dollars invested to get a sense of the reality of cloud capital efficiency per revenue dollar.

As I’ve described in a previous post , this blog’s goal is to create and sustain relationships with readers across the startup landscape.  Tuning the engine is proving much harder than I expected and I suspect that  content marketers are facing similar issues. For example, over the past 18 months I’ve witnessed a halving of RSS subscribers to this blog. They have fallen from about 4,000 to about 2,000. I wasn’t sure what the cause could be, until I compared the RSS data with email subscriber data. The chart above contrasts the two data sets. Clearly, email subscriptions are cannibalizing RSS subscriptions. Logically, the next question to ask then is how to maximize email subscribers. I wondered if the most popular posts generate more email subscribers. Surprisingly, no. Below is a table of all the blog posts bucketed by total visitors generated in quartiles. There are an equal number of blog posts sampled in the 1000-1600 visitor bucket as the 2500-25,000 visitor bucket. The table compares average new email subscribers generated, the percent of visitors those signups represent and the median new subscribers. Visitor Bucket Average New Subs Avg New Sub % Median New Subs 1000 18.6 2.6% 12.0 1600 13.3 1.0% 11 2500 13.7 0.7% 12.0 25,000 12.5 0.2% 8.5 Although the average new subs in each bucket does vary, a running a t-test proves that the averages aren’t statistically different. In other words, the number of new email subscribers to this blog seems to be independent of traffic to the post. Through these two analyses, a few things became clear to me. First, it’s difficult to explore this data. Three different repositories store the figures needed to create this analysis: Google Analytics, FeedBurner and Mailchimp. Aggregating the data meant writing scripts to APIs and then manually cleaning and merging the data. I’d love to see the impact of comments on these metrics. But that means another API, another script and some more data cleaning. Second, it’s easy to draw the wrong conclusions from the data. Looking only at the average new subs number, I might have concluded writing more niche content, perhaps code heavy posts with engineers in mind, would increase this blog’s readership. But the t-test disproved that hypothesis. Third, all this work is time-intensive and for the content marketer looking to maximize daily impact, this type of analysis is cost-prohibitive on daily or even weekly basis. Marketing is being transformed and content marketing is a key component of that transformation, but the tools to make the right decisions about how to properly market aren’t yet in place. First, the data needs to aggregated, rationalized and unified. Then, a layer of analysis and statistics must be applied. With that in place, content marketers and this blog will be much more effective in serving the needs of their audience and achieving their goals. If you’ve seen any tools that might fit the bill, please let me know in the comments. I’d love to give them a spin on my data.

Last week, I had a surreal experience with Uber. It was mid-morning on Friday and I pushed a button to request an UberX as I walked out of Sightglass, the coffee shop deep in the South of Market district. When the car arrived a few minutes later, I got in. Without saying a word, the driver passed me his iPhone. Confused, I looked up from my emails and he mouthed to me, “I am deaf.” I understood and typed in my destination in South Beach into his Google Maps and returned his phone to him. Away we went. A few clicks on my phone later, I found the gesture in sign language for thank you, touching my chin and moving my hand forward. I signed “thank you” as I stepped out of the taxi cab. During that drive, I marveled at the change in the world over the past ten years. Instant taxi. Instant directions. Instant translation. Instant payment. The barriers impeding communication and commerce are being demolished one at a time. Antoine de St. Exupery wrote: The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them. At a time when it’s easier than ever to claim technology is divorcing us from reality, that moment reminded me of all the wonderful things we can do by virtue of the technology we’ve created.

Earlier this week, I attended the Spring YCombinator Demo Day. I’ve been attending for six years now. Each time, I’m impressed by the intelligence, ambition and the polish of the founders presenting companies only a few weeks or months old. As I listened to the pitches, I wondered if the types of startups founders decide to build at YC has changed over time and whether those trends are lagging or leading indicators of the market as a whole. At each Demo Day, the YC team provides investors a list of all the companies pitching and I’ve kept a few. To get a sense of the broader trends in YC companies, I’ve compared the Winter 2012 class and the Spring 2014 class by sector (consumer v. enterprise), segment (ecommerce, education, social, gaming, delivery) and by revenue model (subscription, ads, transactional). These are the trends I observed in the data: Mild shift toward enterprise: In 2012, 48% of YC startups were enterprise. In 2014, enterprise startups were 57% of the class. Within enterprise, there has been a shift toward industry specific Software-as-a-Service (vertical SaaS) at the expense of horizontal SaaS. Vertical SaaS startups comprised 29% of the 2012 enterprise companies and 40% of the 2014 class. To make this idea more concrete, here are two examples. VidPresso provides software to the TV broadcast industry and is an example of vertical SaaS. ZenPayoll, a provider of payroll services, serves many different types of businesses and is a horizontal SaaS company. Platforms-as-a-Service, which enable developers to build and scale applications (Heroku), have also seen a decline in numbers. In 2012, there were 5 PaaS companies while in 2014, I counted 2.
Shifting to consumer, social apps have fallen from 24% of consumer startups to 15% at the most recent demo day. Unlike the 2012 class, there were no gaming companies in 2014. Food delivery companies, education companies and consumer market places have cropped up in their place. As for revenue models, subscription remains dominant. 53% of 2012 YC companies chose this revenue model and 56% chose it in 2014. Also notable is a marked increase in the number of non-profits. The 2014 class graduated 6 of them, up from zero in 2012. All in all, YC startups do seem to be shifting with the market and/or YC partners are screening for startups that are more reflective of the environment. The shifts toward vertical SaaS and away from social and gaming apparent in this class are consistent with the patterns I’m seeing in the fund raising market. Unfortunately, the data isn’t able to tell us who is setting the trend. In any case, I’ll be tracking these trends in the future and hope to be able to draw more conclusions over time.

Imagine a city council meeting with three agenda items: a $100M power plant zoning approval, a request to build a $10,000 bike rack for city sidewalks and and a $100 proposal to buy refreshments for the annual picnic. The power plant discussion takes all of 3 minutes to reach approval, as does the refreshment budget. But the $1000 bike rack debate drags on for hours as council members debate the right materials, the best color scheme and the right way to announce the project. Cyril Northcote Parkinson , a British historian and operations researcher, penned this extreme example of decision-making in meetings in his book Parkinson’s Law . Paraphrasing the Wikipedia entry ,  the powerplant is so expensive, the sums of money are hard to frame. Electricity generation is also quite complicated. As a result, council members lazily skip over the seemingly impenetrable problem in the meeting, deferring to the team managing the project. The bike rack, on the other hand, is tangible. Each member has used a bike rack, and an opinion on which type is the best. In addition, the money at stake rests within a typical person’s spending. So, everyone involved wants to inject their point of view and derive satisfaction from having added value. The discussion drags on and the majority of the meeting time is spent on a relatively trivial topic. It’s easy to be swept up in the trivial and fun stuff, starving the big issues for the time and consideration they merit. Though the differences between projects never reach the extremes described in Parkinson’s hypothetical council meeting, the same behavior occurs. Sometimes I find myself in a conversation I’ve started and realize I’m focused on the bike rack, not the powerplant and wonder how I got there. I’ve seen a few different ways of trying to prevent this corollary to Parkinson’s Law from taking effect, including allocating differing time slots to particular agenda items, placing a stopwatch or clock at the center of a conference room, or providing a quick reminder at the start of a meeting about the relative importance of topics. Ultimately, I think awareness and mindfulness during the meeting is the best antidote; and a culture that welcomes a Parkinson’s Law critique. Have you seen the bike effect at your company? How do you combat it?

Yesterday, Box filed for its IPO and released its S-1 . I enjoy going through S-1s because quite a bit about a private company is revealed and though only a subset of information is released, the S-1 discloses some very important details about the business operations. Over the past several months, I’ve analyzed the basket of the roughly 40 public SaaS companies many different ways. With the Box S-1 in hand, I can now benchmark Box’s business against other publics, and in particular, SaaS companies nine years after founding. Box is also nine years old. Below are seven key comparisons between Box and the average public SaaS business. Box is among the fastest growing SaaS companies at this point in its life. Box’s revenue grew 110% in the last twelve months, about 2x the average rate of 53% of a SaaS company in its ninth year. The two closest companies in terms of growth rate are LinkedIn and Demandware. In their ninth years, LinkedIn grew at 115% and DemandWare grew at 105%. Box’s profitability in year 9 of its life is -136%. No other comparable company comes close in terms of net income % in their ninth year. Second place goes to Rally with -53%. To be fair, NetSuite did record an anomalous loss of -158% of revenues in its eighth year, before falling to -53% the following year. For context, the average public SaaS company generated -14% in net income % at year 9. Box’s burn rate is twice as large as the next comparable firm, and nearly 10x the average. To drive its torrid revenue growth in the last 12 months, Box burned $168M, which is more than twice the next-most-cash-lax company, ServiceNow, which burned $74M in its ninth year en route to generating $424M in revenue. Both of these massive negative net-income figures are head and shoulders above the average SaaS company, which burned $18M to drive $121M in revenue in their ninth years. Box spends about 137% of their revenue on sales and marketing. This sales and marketing expense figure is 3x the average of 42% of revenue found across all other publicly traded SaaS companies at this point in their lifecycle. The next closest comparable is Cornerstone-on-Demand which spent 86% of revenue dollars for sales and marketing. Of the remaining 18 companies in the data set, no other firm exceeded 62%. Box spends nearly 3.7x as much on sales and marketing as research and development. The average public SaaS business spends 2.5x at year nine in its life . Although this figure does put Box in the upper end of the spectrum, Box isn’t without peers. Salesforce spent 5.3x and CSOD spent 6.2x on sales and marketing vs research and development. Box’s average customer value (ACV) is $3,653, much lower than the median of 59,600 . Only RingCentral, a provider of SMB telephone systems, has a smaller average customer value. The typical paid account has 51 paying users, each paying about $71 per year or $6 per month. This ACV is likely going to increase substantially as 57% of orders last year were placed by companies with more than 1,000 seats, though it’s unclear how large the typical deployment is within these large companies. Box’s sales average quarterly efficiency over the last year is 0.4 compared to 0.97 for other SaaS publics. This figure implies a pay-back period of 2.5 years for each acquired customer.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t find churn figures in the S-1, so it’s difficult to make a judgement on long term unit economics. Only LogMeIn had a worse number of 0.27 in its ninth year. All in all, Box’s top-line growth is sensational, but this engine of growth requires absolutely gargantuan amounts of capital to fuel itself. Additionally, this capital need shows no signs of abating. The company’s huge burn rate and massively negative profitability figures indicate a lot of effort must be put into sales to drive incremental revenue growth. Compared to other publicly traded SaaS companies, Box is among the least in efficient customer acquisition. But in this market, which values revenue growth and seemingly ignores profitability , the bottom line doesn’t seem to matter as much as the top line. In that regard, Box is close to the top of the heap.

Over the past few years, I’ve debated the existence of a Series A crunch and found in that analysis that the volume of Series As was increasing. This trend hasn’t abated. The number of Series As has grown by 31% annually for the past 5 years, reaching more than 831 Series As in 2013, up from 284 in 2009. In short, no founder should be concerned about the Series A market. Rather, the Series B market is worrisome. At the moment, Series Bs are the hardest rounds to raise for startups. The data proves the point. The chart above compares the number of Series A rounds and the number of Series B rounds recorded by Crunchbase over the past eight years. Series As have grown dramatically, by more than 30% per year. In contrast, Series Bs lag behind at 10% annual growth. Before 2013, the Series B market was basically flat. Let’s dig one level deeper into the Series As and Bs by round size. The first chart below shows smaller Series As, those with investment sizes under $5M, drive the majority of growth in round volumes. $5-$10M rounds, the brown line, have grown more modestly. Relatively speaking, all other round sizes are flat and irrelevant. The Series B charts by round size tell us that sub $5M Series Bs are also the fastest growing segment, followed by $5 to $15M Series Bs. But the number of $5 to $15M Series Bs hasn’t changed since 2007. Again, larger rounds are largely irrelevant because their numbers are just too small to be significant. Despite the 3x increase in Series A rounds led, the Series B dollars haven’t grown to support an additional 400 startups in the market for a Series B. Needless to say, competition in the Series B market is heating up! I’ll speculate about why this is the case. Perhaps there’s a latency in the market and investors need a few years to seize upon the opportunity. Perhaps there has always been a significant difference in the size of Series B and Series A dollars because the post Series A companies are acquired or fail at a substantial rate. While there has been an enormous expansion of seed funds that catalyze Series A rounds, there has not been an equal expansion in the number of Series B firms, which require larger funds and are harder to raise as a first-time fund manager investor. I’m not sure which is the right answer or if it’s a combination of all of them. In any case, the conclusion is clear. Right now, Series Bs are the hardest rounds to raise. The competition for Series B dollars is about 3x as intense as a few years ago*. Now, more than ever, founders ought to reverse engineer their startup’s Series B pitch to maximize their chances of success. I’m assuming that the rates of company acquisition, company failure and general founder behaviors have remained constant over the past ten years. Unfortunately, it’s hard to prove this point using the Crunchbase data because it’s too noisy.

I’ve been getting a few questions about the tools I use to publish this blog, so I figured I’d write about it and reveal the machinery behind the curtain. I use four main tools Jekyll, Github Mou, and RStudio. Jekyll is the blogging engine; Github is the hosting provider; Mou is the app I use to write these posts; and RStudio is the place I analyze data and make charts. The most important tool is the engine. I chose Jekyll because Jekyll sites load faster than most other blogging platforms. Jekyll is an open source project created by two engineers at Github.  At Google, I saw the importance of page load times on user experience and that has always stuck with me. Also, I wanted the ability to instrument my blog to run experiments and understand the impact on reading habits which meant hosting my own blog rather than using a platform. Most blogging platforms (Wordpress, Tumblr, etc) store user posts in a database. When a blog post page is requested by a blog visitor, Wordpress pings the database for the post content, injects the content into the blog template and sends it to the browser. Said another way, content compilation occurs at the time of request. Jekyll works very differently. A static-site generators (SSG), Jekyll eliminates the database by compiling posts as I write them, instead of when the user asks for them. When a visitor arrives, the content has been prepared already. Because the website is pre-compiled, users load pages faster. SSGs have other benefits, too. Security is much stronger and hosting is cheaper. I host on Github Pages , which is about $7 per month. But the speed comes with a handful usability costs. There is no website to create a new post. Instead, I write the posts in a text-editor on my laptop. I use Mou , an open-source markdown editor, that has a preview pane so I can see what the final post will look like as I type it. Mou also has a spell-checking feature. I wish Mou or other tools also checked grammar the way Microsoft Word has for more than a decade. Also, there is no save or publish button with Jekyll. To publish new posts and fix errors in previous ones, I use git , a command line tool. Because the site must compile after each change, I wait about 5 minutes before a new post goes live. Though Github seems to have accelerated this process quite a bit recently. There is one project that provides a UI on Jekyll/Github sites called Prose.io . But I’ve found it’s very buggy. Because of these challenges, I don’t recommend Jekyll for everybody. Ghost is likely a much better alternative for most companies who need to control their own design. Svbtle and Medium are also wonderful options for individuals. An important difference between the two: Svbtle allows authors to use an existing domain name and Medium provides one for you. To analyze data and create charts, I use a code editor for R called RStudio and two terrific libraries from Hadley Wickham, dplyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for visualization. Plot.ly is a wonderful alternative particularly when I want to build interactive charts. For a while I used Excel/Numbers, but the programming nature of R makes it much easier to re-run previous analyses with new data. Also, R has a huge collection of different tools for creating box plots and maps, and also doing more sophisticated types of analysis like linear modeling and moving averages. I designed the site using Bootstrap.js , Twitter’s excellent library for responsive layouts. Typekit provides two fonts, P22-Underground for the titles and Minion-Pro for paragraph text. The blog is instrumented with Google Analytics with custom events . I’ve instrumented all the sharing actions (Twitter, FB, HackerNews etc.), the subscription actions (email + rss) and also the Read this Next feature at the bottom of the page. I’m missing a tool for automatically resizing images to the right dpi and width, to maximize page load times. Today, I do this by hand with Apple’s Preview if the file size is greater than 200 kb. That’s my blogging machinery. If you have suggestions on a better toolkit or thoughts on this one, I’d love to hear them. Send me a tweet .

Each morning’s news seems to bring another fund-raising announcement of ever larger scale. Just a few months ago, Pure Storage raised $150M in the largest ever venture investment in a storage company . These record financings certainly generate significant press interest. But how representative of the fund raising environment are these mega-rounds? The chart above breaks down fund-raising activity in US tech companies using Crunchbase data . Each chart shows the number of rounds raised bucketed by size from $0 to $5M and up to $150M to $200M from 2005 to 2013. Each bucket has grown over the past 8 years and most of them steadily. But there are a few outliers. $75M investments spiked in 2013. $150M and $200M investments have been relatively stable over the past four years. In addition to looking at gross numbers, let’s compare the growth rates from 2009 to 2013 of each of these buckets. The data proves what impressions from press suggested: the number of mega-rounds has increased by 150%-200% in the past four years. $30M-$50M and $150-$200M rounds rounds are 1.5x more common in 2013 as 2009 and $75-100M rounds have doubled during this time frame. The smaller, presumably earlier stage investments are growing at a good clip, too - about 50%. Interestingly, the number of rounds has a 0.977 R^2 value to dollars raised, meaning investors are pushing more and more capital through the ecosystem at effectively the same growth rates as the ones in the chart above. All of this is good news for entrepreneurs. There is more capital flowing through the ecosystem than four years ago. Additionally, there are investors that are increasingly willing to invest IPO-sized chunks of capital into private companies, enabling them to grow more, potentially acquire other companies and avoid the costs of going public until later. Needless to say, it’s boom times.

Last week, Sean Ellis made an interesting comment in response to this post on public SaaS companies’ growth rates : I’m guilty of giving the same advice to startup founders without providing a transparent rationale. This post is my explanation of why the 15-20% MRR growth number is a reasonably good target for post-Seed/pre-Series A SaaS startups to aim for. Let’s create a hypothetical SaaS startup called SaaSCo with a set of founders who aspire to a fund-raising trajectory like the one in table below. The numbers in this chart are rough estimates of what a fast growing SaaS startup might command in the market, but they aren’t based in any data or surveys. Round Raised in $M % Sold Implied Valuation in$M Seed 1 15% 6.7 Series A 5 20% 25 Series B 10 20% 50 Series C 15 15% 100 Presuming the founders of SaaSCo raise their target seed round, the founders want to leverage their newfound cash to grow the business to reach the next milestone, the Series A. To reach their target Series A valuation, and holding all other variables constant, the SaaSCo founders must grow their revenues by 3.75x, which is 25/6.7. As my colleague Jamie Davidson showed in his analysis of startup follow-on activity , the most successful time for startups to raise a Series A is about 9-10 months after raising a seed. Combining these two data points, the SaaSCo founders deduce they must increase revenues by 3.75x in about 10 months.  Backing out the monthly growth rates to achieve those numbers gives us the chart below. To satisfy both the revenue and timing conditions, the SaaSCo founders should aim for a 15%+ monthly growth rate. There are quite a few problems with this analysis. Most importantly, the fund-raising market isn’t completely rational or elastic so the presumption of a constant valuation-to-revenue multiple on SaaSCo is a fallible one. Also, there are lots of deviations in startup paths that are hard to predict, both positive and negative, so planning on constant growth is difficult. Last, we’re not taking into account the varying impacts of burn rate, churn rate and hiring needs demanded on the company by pursuing different monthly growth rates. But, this hypothetical models makes the case for 15%+ monthly revenue growth as a good rule of thumb for SaaS companies looking to raise a Series A soon. The same process can be used to create ballpark estimates for post-Series B and C companies as well.

After reading a few of the S-1 analyses on this blog , an entrepreneur asked me to look into the balance sheets of public SaaS companies. More specifically, how much cash should SaaS  hold? How much equity do they raise? And do they employ debt to grow? The chart above shows the median cash on the balance sheet by year of founding for publicly traded SaaS companies.  By its second year in business, the median SaaS company in this data has about $7M on its balance sheet at year two, from either the combination of a large seed round and Series A, or just a large A. The company grows quickly enough to raise a $12-$25M Series B in the next 12-18 months, which is year 3 or 4 in the company’s life. The business deploys that capital to continue growth at which point it raises another $20-30M in its Series C in year five, and another $20-$30M in year six which should be the final round before IPO. Most often, SaaS publics IPO in year seven, but this figure varies quite a bit. Let’s look at the net income data to see how much of the venture capital the median SaaS company consumes over time. The bar chart above depicts the median net income by year since founding. In year 3, the net income is about -$7M, then -$11M. The net annual loss peaks in years 5 and 6 at just about -$17.5M. In all, the median publicly traded SaaS company invests $60M to develop its product and grow before it goes public. In addition, it holds about $28M in on its balance sheet at IPO for a median total raise of about $88M before IPO. The typical size of a SaaS IPO is $82M, In total, the median SaaS publicly traded company raises $170M in total, through IPO. Now, for the question of debt. 60% of SaaS publics have employed debt of some sort before going public. But as the chart above shows, the median amount of debt is quite small, at or below $1M every year. In other words, the vast majority of SaaS growth to date has been paid for with equity dollars. This may be for a few reasons. First, the equity markets have provided large amounts capital relatively cheaply. Second, debt must be repaid. Most SaaS companies operate at negative net income, so the debt repayment is unlikely to be made from free cash flow. Instead, it will be repaid with equity dollars. If equity can be raised easily, why bother with debt? After IPO, it’s a different story. I’ve plotted the debt patterns by company above and changed the x-axis to be years before/after IPO. It’s much more common to see SaaS companies raise debt after IPO than before, at which point, they may raise huge amounts. Salesforce, for example, has about $2.5B in debt. NetSuite has about $200M. But these are exceptional cases, many years after IPO. In the early stages of SaaS companies, debt is either used in relatively small amounts, compared to equity, or simply not at all. I should note there are many successful paths to market and the median doesn’t mean the right path to market. I have written extensively about Veeva , which raised only $4.5M before going public. This analysis is for the median SaaS company in a basket of 41 companies with S-1s, and the median hides a lot of variation in the data.

At the time of the IPO, the median Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company generates $100M in revenue, creates $2.6M in profit and holds $85M in cash on the balance sheet. A company in this position typically raises $107M in its IPO and trades at 11x revenue, for a $1.1B market cap. The path to getting there is revealing. Below is a chart showing the median revenue ramp of the 41 publicly traded SaaS companies by year since founding. In year 3, the median revenue is $11M. In year 4, the revenue figures more than double to $25M, and then again to $55M. Note, the $11M number in year 3 is somewhat skewed by extraordinarily fast-growing companies. I’ve used data from public filings in this analysis and of the 20 companies profiled with data available in this time frame, only 5 of them (Veeva, Marin, LogMeIn, SuccessFactors, and DealerTrack), grew fast enough to IPO within a time period that would have forced them to disclose their year 3 revenues. By year four, the sample size doubles to nine. To see the trend in greater detail, click here . This chart shows the median growth rates of public SaaS companies by year since founding. 220% growth in year 3, and then about 110% growth for the next two years, and then halving once more for the next four years. As for profitability, the public SaaS companies in the data set spent 86% of revenue in Year 2, and 167% of revenue in year 3 before falling to the mid-fifties and reaching near-profitability in year 6. Of course, there is a substantial variance hidden within these summary statistics. For example, about 1/3 of the companies in the data set waited more than ten years to file their S-1s.  Two waited 18 years. But the figures do provide a rough sense of the magnitude of revenue and the pace of growth needed to take a SaaS company public.

SaaS companies are the darlings of the public market. The average publicly traded SaaS company enjoys twice as strong a revenue multiple as ten years ago. SaaS companies’ time to IPO has been decreasing steadily from over 10 years since founding to under 7. Despite the decrease in time to IPO, the average dollars raised at IPO has tripled from the early nineties and grown by 50% since 2000. I analyzed the 41 publicly traded SaaS companies comparing to understand the trends in SaaS IPO. The data set is here . Here are four charts depicting the trends. The average SaaS company trades at a 11x enterprise value to revenue multiple, up from 6x in 2006. It’s impossible to ascribe this multiple expansion to a single cause. It could be the growth rates of the companies in this basket, the relative attractiveness of this category compared to other stocks, a better comprehension of the value of these companies by public market investors, or the opposite! In any case, valuations for SaaS companies in the public market are at ten-year highs. The time commitment required to become a publicly traded company has decreased by third from about 12 years in 1995 to about 7 today. Some of this downward pressure on time-to-IPO may be because a company founded in 2008 needing ten years to go public hasn’t had the chance to appear in the data set. To improve this analysis, it would be useful to look at the 2014 IPO pipeline. Despite the decrease in time, the average size of a SaaS IPO has been steadily increasing by $7M per year. Some part of this is due to multiple expansion, mentioned above. Other hypotheses include startups leveraging more efficient sales channels (Veeva and Salesforce for example), more venture dollars raised to finance growth or even a changing customer base more receptive to SaaS offerings. Curiously enough, the average size of an IPO doesn’t change with age. I wondered if some companies waited a few extra years to raise larger IPOs, but the data doesn’t show that to be the case. The median offering size is statistically equivalent over quite a range times. For a boxplot showing this distribution, click here . All in all, there’s never been a better time to start a SaaS company or take one public. Valuation multiples are healthy, growth rates are strong and the time to IPO is decreasing. Quite an exciting time to be a SaaS entrepreneur!

One of the most important trends in the Internet at the moment is unbundling. Entrepreneurs are picking apart Craigslist and eBay, vertical by vertical . At the same time, other entrepreneurs have replicated the core functions and features of Facebook and LinkedIn , creating hugely valuable companies . But simply calling this trend unbundling doesn’t do the movement justice, particularly in the transactional web. The trend is more fundamental. Craigslist and eBay are the canonical internet market places. Craigslist is synonymous with internet classifieds. eBay coupled a payments system to the listings model, enabling user-to-user transactions at scale. Both eBay and Craigslist exposed the buyer to the seller in a transparent way. They avoid arbitrating or regulating disputes as much as possible, and push as much of the negotiation and price discovery as possible to the buyer and seller. For this, eBay charges 10% of gross merchandise value. Both companies provide large amounts of liquidity, a little bit of advice and take a relatively small stake of the transaction value. But the newest market places don’t operate this way. The newest market places don’t look like market places at all. Instead they operate more like agencies or stores. The new market places emphasize simplicity over transparency. Simplicity in price discovery; simplicity in quality; simplicity in customer support and service. In exchange, these new market places tend to extract much larger fractions of the transaction, upwards of 20%. here’s a table showing the evolution in a few of the categories: Category Listings Transaction Service Vacation Rental HomeAway AirBnB OneFineStay Used Electronics Craigslist eBay Glyde, Gazelle Clothing Craigslist Poshmark ThredUp Transportation Yellow Pages Hailo Uber Labor Craigslist ? TaskRabbit In these new market places, the supplier doesn’t hang his own shingle. The brand of the provider is enshrouded by the service. Uber drivers are free agents but customers don’t know which limousine service they work for. ThredUp doesn’t reveal the identity of its clothing suppliers to buyers, only their location. Guests at a OneFineStay resort may never know the owner of the house. Unlike the eBay and Craigslist models, buyers don’t need to know these identities because the company provides customer support and service on their behalf. This unified service model provides a higher-quality, more consistent and more satisfying experience. This is done in the name of driving more liquidity through the market place. More volume means more business for everyone. I expect the web will continue to move in this direction. Consumers benefit from better experiences. Market places benefit from substantially larger margin. The only question is for suppliers who operate at lower margins, which they trade for outsourced support and service.

Since the first transistor, increasing speed has been at the core of much innovation in Silicon Valley . Over more than three decades, Moore’s Law has remained the engine of progress in chip technology. I’ve been wondering if a analogous productivity law will be written for data. One level up the stack from the chip, software has benefitted tremendously from chip speed. I learned to code in Java, which I needed to compile before I could test my program. Each compilation required 3 or 4 minutes and this latency slowed me down. In comparison, the languages dominating today’s programming stacks provide instant feedback. I saw 90% time savings to write code when I shifted to Ruby. Two levels up the stack, applications also profit from Moore’s law. Apps can process more data, larger images, bigger movie files - and all of it much faster than before. But no where is the benefit more apparent to me than in data processing. At Google, I watched the company evolve its data processing technology from MapReduce to Dremel. Having left the Googleplex, I still keep tabs on innovations like F1 . Today, companies outside of Google are replicating this transition from Hadoop to Impala to Spark and other databases. While that change may seem intangible, much like an additional hundred million transistors squeezed onto a smaller chip, the benefit is real, concrete and massive. Today, with Redshift and Looker , a salesperson can analyze a few billion rows of data in a second. Not a data scientist or statistician or engineer. But a salesperson. The perfomance improvement throughout the entire stack, from chip to database to application, has reduced the feedback cycles to sub-second responses. The magnitude of that change can’t be overstated, because it makes all the petabytes of data companies generate and collect useful to everyone in an organization. I hope there will be a power law written one day that shows as the amount of data processed increases geometrically, the quality of decision-making within companies increases and so does their worth.

Most SaaS companies provide tools to help people accomplish a goal in a better way than they could before. A key part of a SaaS startup’s toolkit, then, is changing end user behavior. A startup that doesn’t change the behavior of a customer will see the customer churn in a few months or at the expiration of their contract. Customers don’t change their behavior for many reasons. Sometimes the friction to adopting a new workflow is too great. Other times, the value proposition isn’t compelling enough for users. Or, the use case is too infrequent for users to remember to change behavior. But to succeed, SaaS startups must turn motivation into capability. I’ve seen three ways for SaaS companies to accomplish this goal listed in order of effectiveness: Product : a really great product sells itself. People want to use it because it’s significantly better than whatever preceded it. Product is the strongest and most persistent way of changing behavior. It’s also the most scalable. A great user experience is repeatable with near-zero marginal cost for each user. Dropbox is a great example of how a dramatically better product sells itself and changes user behavior at scale. Looker’s simple tools for data exploration invite entire companies to ask and answer questions of their data. Sales : sales teams can sell the promise of a product and post-sales/customer success teams then reinforce the promise and train customers to operate a product. Sales-based behavior change is obviously much more expensive than product-based behavior change. As a result, it’s typically reserved for large enterprise customers and products serving those customers. Customer retention hinges on the company’s ability to sell the value proposition to end users and develop a process to scalably chang their behavior through training and support. Workday and Responsys are two good public SaaS examples of this kind of customer behavior change. Marketing : marketing can sell a dream and appeal to the aspiration of end users to be better at something or be on the cutting edge. Marketing teams can build tremendous interest in a new product category. But marketing can often be challenged in changing behavior, unless the team takes on the responsibility of engaging users after a sale. Post-sales lifecycle marketing makes use of product engagement data to trigger tutorials, encouragement emails and the like to reinforce product use. Yammer’s email notifications of updates on the network are one example of this kind of behavior. In another example, LinkedIn emails users how popular they are to encourage investment in the product. Figuring out the tactics and techniques to convert initial customer enthusiasm and passion for a project into new behaviors is key to long term customer retention and success in SaaS.

Over the last 12 years, the number of startups founded has grown each year by 25%, according to Crunchbase data . That’s quite an acceleration each year! See the chart here . As the number of companies in a sector grows, do the odds of successfully raising capital decrease? The chart above shows startup company formation rates, the number of new companies formed each year from 2004-2011 by Crunchbase sector. I didn’t graph the 2012 or 2013 data because the Crunchbase team told me the data sets need about 2 years to mature. Most of the categories are up and to the right. Advertising, hardware, messaging, music and PR are the notable exceptions with substantial decreases. On the whole, then, startups are competing with more and more other startups to raise capital. Below is a chart of the most competitive categories in 2011, those with the greatest rates of company formation. The first four tags: web, mobile, enterprise, and software are catchall. Then on down the list. Given this trend in 2011, and analogous trends in the ten years of the data set, we can evaluate the changes in ability to fundraise as the number of startups in a category increases. This last chart shows the correlation between the rate of company formation and the average dollars raised per company. On the whole, the relationship between the number of new companies founded in a sector in a year and the startup cohort’s ability to raise money is very weak, an average R^2 of -.11. So we can explain about 10% of the variance of dollars raised per startup through increased competition - not very much at all. In aggregate, the effect of competition doesn’t seem to be meaningful. At a micro-level, it could be that while several companies in a sector do compete for investment, they also each create awareness and excitement about the category which overall keeps the dollars raised per startup relatively equally. Though this is just speculation. In any case, these data don’t show any meaningful relationship between number of entrants in a category and fundraising success. The corollary to this analysis might be a startup’s biggest challenge isn’t its competition, but finding a way to grow scalably.

Raising capital from venture capitalists at any stage can seem like a very strange, ambiguous and amorphous process. I’ve written about the way Redpoint diligences/researches a startup and its market and what questions we tend to ask at each stage. In this post, I’ll focus on the process from entrepreneur’s point of view. When raising capital, entrepreneurs will see potential investors move through four phases of investment decision-making process: screening, socialization, diligence, and decision. I’ve drawn a schematic that illustrates this evolution above. The chart also shows a line indicating the progression from one step to the next, using data from my own investment funnels. Screening : the first call and/or first meeting. The screening step can include associates, principals and/or one or two partners. In this phase, investors are evaluating the risks of the investment , the market size, and the industry, to determine if it’s a fit with their fund size and investment goals . Looking at my CRM data, roughly 15% of startups continue onto the next stage. Socialization : excited by a startup’s pitch and prospects, the partner/team who met with the company will share their knowledge with other members of the firm. VCs typically ask for second meetings during socialization. In second meetings, founders  repeat the pitch to a broader group within the firm, though typically not the entirety of the partnership. If the deal team resonates with the founders and the opportunity and vice-versa, the deal team begins diligence. Again, about 15% of startups move onto diligence. Diligence : the deal team begins researching the opportunity and share their findings with the broader partnership. This includes evaluating the team, the market, product roadmap and sales pipeline. Behind the scenes, VCs call contacts in industry to refine their point of view. As the research progresses, VCs will often volley questions back to the startup, seeking clarification. Typically, the diligence process is focused on a few key questions like market size, defensibility, regulatory risk, or competition. Increasingly, investors and founders discuss deal structure and outline deal terms at this stage. After diligence, about 10% of startups continue to the final “Partner Meeting,” a meeting of all the partners in a venture firm, or the entirety of the VC’s investment committee. Decision : This the “Partner Meeting.” Beforehand, the deal team briefs the partnership on all the diligence materials, key questions, and deal terms. Founders pitch the entire partnership.  After the meeting, all the partners debrief on the opportunity. Some firms provide deal teams latitude to make decisions on their own; others have implemented rigid voting processes to seek approval for investment. Granted approval and with a term sheet in hand, VCs then must convince an entrepreneur to sign their term sheet and partner with them. In the past 2 years, I’ve been lucky to invest in three companies (Axial, Electric Imp and Looker), for a success rate of 6% in this stage, or 0.2% throughout the process. For founders, it’s important to understand where they are in the process with investors for two reasons. First, so as not to misjudge the finish line either by running out of capital in the midst of a process or presume success at too early a stage. Second, to build auction pressure in financings to create negotiating leverage on terms. Keeping VCs in stride with each other is one tactic to accomplish this goal. The first part to ensuring a successful fund raising process is understanding the milestones. But ideally, after this process is completed, a founding team and an investor have built a strong and mutually beneficial relationship that will last many years and throughout the company’s ups and downs.

The process of creating the right culture in a startup has always been mysterious to me. Each company’s culture evolves in its own way. I’ve wondered whether the culture is set by the personalities of the founders, or prominently displayed value statements and mission, or biases purposely imposed in the hiring processes like Google’s googliness filter. Or is understanding the psychological forces at play among employees the most important element? Maria Popova, the editor of Brain Pickings, recently wrote about one of these psychological forces called the Ben Franklin effect . She extracted this concept from a book on common self-delusions called You Are Now Less Dumb . In the post, which is very much worth reading, she writes we seem to believe that “we do nice things to people we like and bad things to those we dislike.” But the Franklin Effect rejects that idea. Our actions mold our beliefs, not the other way around. Quoting from the book: Your attitudes came from actions that led to observations that led to explanations that led to beliefs. Your actions tend to chisel away at the raw marble of your persona, carving into being the self you experience from day to day. It doesn’t feel that way, though. To conscious experience, it feels as if you were the one holding the chisel, motivated by existing thoughts and beliefs. It feels as though the person wearing your pants performed actions consistent with your established character, yet there is plenty of research suggesting otherwise. The things you do often create the things you believe. If the Ben Franklin effect is real and we reconcile our values to our actions, culture isn’t first written on a piece of paper and then manifested in the company. It’s the other way around. Employees’ behavior creates the culture which are then written down and posted on the wall. In which case, a startup’s most effective tool to influence culture is its hiring process. To create a strong culture, founders must select the candidates who will act in the ways consistent with the company’s values. Much easier said than done, particularly in this competitive talent-market. But at least with the Franklin Effect there’s some research to defend the hiring process.

A few days ago, Simply Business published an infographic and data on the acquisition patterns of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Yahoo . Looking at that data, I wondered which acquirers pay the most for startups. Ideally, this data provides some negotiating leverage to founders selling their businesses. I’ve prepared three charts and a table to tell the story. The first compares the average acquisition prices over the life of each of the tech monoliths. The y-axis is in log scale. A value of 2 means $10M^2 or $100M. On the whole, the average acquisition prices are all in the same ball park. Facebook and Google have outliers, demarcated by dots, which are WhatsApp and DoubleClick, Nest, Motorola for Google. Next let’s look at M&A activity by company.  Google is also by far the most acquisitive company, averaging 11 acquisitions per year since 1999. This is close to twice the pace of Facebook at second place with 6.7. Amazon and Apple are much less acquisitive. The last column shows the largest acquisition completed by the acquirer. Apple is notable for the contrast between the $40B in cash on its balance sheet and the $390M largest acquisition in the past 15 years. I suppose Apple believe the best innovations come from within. A note about data quality: in this data set, the large tech companies reported the values of on average 43% of their acquisitions, which are disproportionately the smaller ones. Google discloses the fewest transactions, only 35%. Undisclosed Total Disclosed M&A/Year Max Acq. $1B+ Amazon 22 37 40.5% 2.5 928 0 Apple 24 44 45% 2.9 390 0 Facebook 23 41 44% 6.7 19,000 1 Google 93 144 35% 11.1 12,500 4 Yahoo 44 87 49% 5.7 5,004 4 Now that we have a sense of activity and averages, let’s segment these acquisition histories by transaction size to get a sense of willingness-to-pay. I’ve divided the data into quintiles, five equally sized chunks of acquisitions. These quintiles are <$25M, <$40M, <$100M, <$330M and <$19B. The chart below shows the number of companies in each quintile by acquirer. Apple and Facebook seem to prefer smaller acquisitions or at least have a disproportionate share of them. Amazon makes fewer smaller acquisitions, prefering $100M+. Google and Yahoo show almost uniform distributions in their M&A. Next, let’s look at prices within each of these segments. The boxplot below shows the distribution of prices paid by each acquirer in each of the different quintiles. Facebook shows the largest acquisition averages in two of the five quintiles ($40M and $19B), Yahoo shows the largest acquisition average in one quintile ($25M), and Amazon and Apple round out the five. In the acquihire bucket, Amazon pays the least by a substantial margin. Google and Yahoo seem to offer the best prices; Apple has a lower average but a $15M mean still places Apple 50% above Facebook’s. In the $25-$40M bucket, Apple and Google seem to have a $30M ceiling on prices here, displaying almost no variance from it. Facebook and Yahoo show more flexibility. Next in the $40M-$100M bucket, Facebook and Google acquire throughout the spectrum. Amazon pays a premium, while Apple and Yahoo bargain-shop. In the $100-$330M segment, Amazon and Apple show the highest averages at around $250M, while Google and Yahoo have means of around $150M. Note the non-zero y-axis here, which artifically accentuates the differences. This is a bug in the plotting library I use. Last, in the billion-dollar bucket, the data is dominated by exceptions: WhatApps, DoubleClick, Overture, YouTube, Motorola. It’s hard to draw a conclusion. In summary, Amazon doesn’t seem to make acquihires, while Yahoo, Facebook and Google seem to acquire quite a few. Neither Apple nor Amazon make large acquisitions, while Yahoo and Google have 80% market share of $1B+ M&A in this data set. There seems to be no consistent pattern on M&A willingness-to-pay across these segments, so it’s hard to recommend a universal strategy to maximize acquisition price based on past behavior aside from speaking with the corp dev teams who tend to be most active in a given category or transaction size. This is just one way of looking at the data. I’ve tried to tell one story using a post-hoc analysis, but I suspect much of the variation in the acquisition data is driven by individual companies and transactions rather than a long-term acquisition strategy. If you’d like to perform your own analysis, you can download the data set I used here.

From zero to $19B of business value in five years; WhatsApp’s sale to Facebook is an important moment in the history of the consumer web. The deal proves distribution, reach and large user bases aren’t the competitive moats they once were. Apple’s App Store and Google Play have leveled the playing field to such an extent that a startup can command 10% of the market cap from a $200B company. To reach scale in the search-driven world of the web meant waiting 90 days to appear in the Google search rankings, maximizing inbound links, optimizing anchor text. In those web days, a startup couldn’t dream of appearing as the first search result on their launch day. It was an impossibility. But in mobile, this happens all the time. Startups launch and on their first day in the iTunes store, the app hits the top of the charts, # 1. This possibility allows the world to turn on its head very quickly, for Instagram to create a $1B company in 18 months with 30M users and for Whatsapp to amass a rabidly engaged mobile user base larger than Facebook’s. Mobile app store rankings don’t value historical relationships the way web search does. What have you done for your users lately, they ask? These near-instant feedback loops challenge incumbents to continue to earn the attention of their user bases with better products than rivals’ applications. As a result, Clay Christensen’s innovator’s dilemma surfaces not every decade, like the stories of steel mini-mills or hard drive makers, but every 18 months. Because the mobile user base is 10x larger than the PC world, because the older competitive moats don’t work, because the disruption cycles are so fast, competition in the consumer web has never been fiercer. Ergo, massive acquisitions. There will be a litany of cascading effects from this massive acquisition. I suspect consumer pre-money valuations will surge, founders will redouble their efforts to build strategically important services and innovation will accelerate. For incumbents, the race is on to save their businesses. For startups, the opportunity to disrupt has never been more accessible.

When a startup is confronted with the prospect of hiring a head of marketing, founders heads often spin. What should be the day-to-day tasks for this person? What skill sets are important? Because of the seeming abstract nature of marketing, founders sometimes delay finding a head of marketing until they feel acute pain, at which point they can clearly identify the attributes of the right candidate. But underinvestment in marketing, like underinvestment in infrastructure or software or product, isn’t a good idea. As a few of the companies I work with have sought to hire heads of marketing, I’ve been working through similar questions of how to define and describe the characteristics of the right marketing hire. There are three distinct marketing skillsets to weigh when hiring a head of marketing: marketing communications, quantitative marketing, and product marketing. Marketing Communications - aka MarCom, is the team reponsible for the brand and the voice of the company in the market place. Marcom teams typically create sales collateral, white papers, the content for content marketing, event materials and so on. Marcom is the least frequently employed skillset in startups because the effectiveness of the team is very difficult to quantify. Marcom is the mushy work most people associate with marketing. But the lack of metrics doesn’t diminish the value or impact of the team’s work. Marcom teams interact quite a bit with Public Relations (internal or external). Quantitative Marketing - aka growth hacking, is the team reponsible for marketing qualified leads (MQL). These teams are by nature technical, often performing significant data analysis to maximize return-on-investment of their marketing spend. For consumer startups like gaming companies, quantitative marketing teams buy ads across networks, test different creatives often supplied by marcom or another team and then optimize this process. In enterprise startups, the quantitative marketing teams are also called demand generation teams. They field inbound calls and inquiries and also make outbound calls to drum up meetings with potential customers. These leads are passed to the sales teams. Quantitative Marketing teams are most closely aligned with sales. Product Marketing - Though there are many different flavors of product marketing. In this case, I use the term the way Apple defines product marketing. Before launch, product marketers analyze the customer base: demographics, interests, needs segmentations, willingness-to-pay, etc. This data informs the product and engineering roadmap. Once the product is launched, product marketers position the product in the market, price and discount it, and own the commercial success of the launch. Product marketers work closely with product managers and engineering leaders at the beginning of a product’s lifecycle and then with MarCom and Quantitative Marketing teams after launch. By dividing the marketing skill set into these three buckets and deciding which skillset is the most important and which are nice-to-haves, it’s easier to identify the best head of marketing candidate for a particular role. The key to hiring the right marketing person is to match the needs of the company with a candidates skills. Distilling the needs of the company into these three skillsets helps dispel the amorphous fog around the word marketing.

Great entrepreneurs can come from anywhere . But do the locations of startups affect their ability to raise follow on capital? Do seed stage companies in the Bay Area face lower likelihoods of raising a Series A because of more competition? Or is it that New York based startups, because of a smaller ecosystem, face more difficulty? Using Crunchbase data , I charted the financing follow-on rates across the 12 US cities in which at least 10 seeds, 3 Series As and 3 Series Bs have occured in the Crunchbase data set from 2005-2014. The first two charts below contrast the success rates of post-seed startups raising an A having raised a seed and raising a B having raised an A. The third chart shows the success rates of raising a B having raised a seed round. A startup’s headquarters location seems to have no impact on the company’s ability to raise a Series A. Though there are variances between the low of Washington DC (11%) and the high of Seattle (29%), the differences aren’t statistically significant. In the Series B market, Pittburgh and Houston are two outliers where 100% of the recorded Series As raised Bs. Of course, the total number of companies in each case, is small, only 3. Setting aside those aberrations, again the differences between the markets aren’t statistically significant. These statistics don’t reveal any information about the difficulty of these follow-on rounds, or the terms of those rounds, or the time required to raise those rounds. But they do show the fund raising market is relatively efficient. Despite the concentrations of capital sources in places like Sand Hill Road and the Flat Iron District,  investors are willing to board planes to seek out and underwrite investments in great companies, no matter where in the country they may be.

When presented with figures and numbers and statistics, it’s easy to take the conclusions as fact. Numbers in a spreadsheet carry a finality, a exactitude that belies how inaccurate they can be. In 2005, Stanford professor Johannes Ioannidis turned the world of research and statistics on its head. He published “ Why Most Published Research Findings Are False. ” Ioannidis’ paper cast doubt on decades of research. More than 75% of experimental results  published in the world’s best journals couldn’t be replicated. The conclusions were results of bad experimental design, biases in the data , and statistical tools used incorrectly. A crisis of truth ripped through the research community. For the first time in about 90 years, researchers and statisticians are re-evaluating their methods. One of the major problems with data analysis are the imperfect methods we use . Every student in a statistics class has come across p-values. Despite taking 3 statistics courses in college, I found them impossible to understand each time because their interpretation isn’t intuitive. P-value measures how often a result will happen by chance. But p-values doesn’t answer the question to the answer most people care about: what are the odds the hypothesis about the data is correct? In addition to dissolving faith in the research process, bad data encourages wrong decision-making. In most cases, bad data is worse than no data at all. This is as much true for the research community as for startup management teams. Because of the tendency to believe numbers as fact and the high rates of error of the methods we use, data has to be the start of the decision making process, not the end. As Richard Royall, professor of stats at Johns Hopkins says, when faced with data it’s critical to ask three questions: What does the data imply? What do I believe? What should I do, considering both?

Has it become harder to raise money? is a question I hear all the time. On one hand, the total dollars invested by VCs is relatively flat at just under $30B per year, according to the NVCA . On the other hand, the stories of difficulty raising series As and Bs have become a steady drumbeat. To get some sense of the patterns, I analyzed 917 companies from seed through Series B over the past 14 years, using Crunchbase data. I’ve divided the companies into cohorts by the year they raised their seed investment. Click on the charts to view interactive ones. The chart shows the narrow funnel seed stage companies must pass through to raise a series A. There are three observations we can make from the chart. First, the number of seed investments in the Crunchbase data has increased by 4x in 4 years. Some of this growth is better data recording, but I suspect the majority of the growth is driven by increased seed investments. Second, the total number of Series As has also increased, but it’s hard to say whether that’s data accuracy or ground-truth. Third, the total number of Series Bs is remaining relatively constant, even for the newer cohorts, like the 2012 class. Across all these cohorts, the mean success rate to raise an A after a Seed is 27%, to raise a B after an A is 35%, and the whole way through the funnel, Seed to B, is 11.5%. Said another way, only 12% of companies who raise a Seed will raise a B. If you’re wondering how these trends have changed over time, this next chart will answer that question for you. The x-axis shows calendar year and the y-axis shows the % of companies that raised a round. The blue line shows the percentage of companies raising an A after a seed; the orange line shows the percent of post-Series A companies raising a B; the green line shows the percent of post-Seed companies who have run the gauntlet successfully to raise a Series B. The secular decline in all of these ratios screams of increased competition. According to analysis by my partner Jamie Davidson on typical periods between financings peaks around 9 months so the follow on rates for Series Bs should be accurate up until the 2011 class, which gives these startups more than 2 years to raise their B. Data from 2012 and 2013 will show lower success rates because most of these companies won’t be mature enough to be in the market for a B. Despite the noisy data, it’s reasonable to conclude the financing market has become more competitive, driven by an increase in the total number of startups raising seed capital and a relatively constant inflow of capital into venture capital.

The average seed stage startup has a 20% chance of raising a Series A according to Crunchbase data for IT startups who raised seed and Series A rounds between 2006 and 2013. But this figure varies significantly sector by sector. Below is a chart of the different startups’ sectors and their rates of raising Series A capital net of the mean of 20%. To contrast two diametric examples, 40% of seed-stage search startups raised Series As, while on average only 10% of hardware startups raise Series As. For an interactive chart, click here . Search, transportation, finance and analytics startups have the best rates of Series A financing. On the other hand, startups in the messaging, hardware, real estate and legal sectors have a much harder time, typically about 50% worse than the average company.  Web and Software effectively equal the average because they are the most broadly applied tags. Since search is the best business on the internet , I’m not surprised by the high follow-on rates in that sector. Uber’s succcess has spawned a handful of similar businesses, driving the transportation category. Finance was quietly booming , but since Bitcoin broke 1000:1 USD:BTC exchange rate, financial innovations are hard to miss. Analytics is likely the catch-all for big data. The startup sectors facing a harder road to Series A rounds are either competing in vibrant and fiercely competitive sectors (messaging), capital intensive sectors (hardware), or sectors that require some rarer expertise to understand (real estate and legal). Interestingly enough, most of these seed stage companies raise similar size Series As. Only hardware companies raise substantially more. But there are very high variances in the data set, as indicated by the error bars. The usual caveats apply in this analysis about the noisiness of Crunchbase data. Also, because we don’t have knowledge of how many fund raising processes each of these startups attempted, we can’t make meaningful comparisons over time or establish much in the way of causation.

Naming your startup can be one of the hardest things to do when starting a company. Each founder must agree. The domain must be available to buy. Last and perhaps most importantly, investors need to like it because the  first letter of startup’s name has meaningful impact on how easily the company will be able to raise money. Whatever you do, don’t pick a name that starts with the letter J. Or K. Or Q. Instead, favor names beginning with T, O and A. Below is a chart showing the share of capital raised by startups broken down by the first letter of their names for Series A rounds of IT companies in 2013. The data is normalized for the number of startups with each letter-name. Startups with T-names raise 100% more capital during the Series A than the average startup. Startups with the letter A garner 50% larger investments. On the other hand, founders who mistakenly chose J-words raised 50% less capital in 2013, quite a disadvantage in the market. The data clearly proves picking the right letter for a startup’s name is correlated to the amount of money the company will raise in its Series A. But here’s the trick: the relationship isn’t causal, just correlated. So all that advice about picking the right letter…it’s useless. What’s in a name, after all? Looker by any other name would still analyze data elegantly. Thanks to @milesgrimshaw who inspired this reminder not to believe everything you read, even if there’s seemingly cohorent data to support the argument.

How large of a seed round should founders raise to maximize their chances of raising a Series A? Smaller seed rounds are simpler and faster to raise because they typically require fewer investors. They may also require less dilution because of the smaller investment size. On the other hand, to raise a Series A, the startup needs enough runway to hire a team and prove certain milestones to Series A investors. Using Crunchbase data from 2005 to 2012, I’ve plotted the follow-on rates by size of seed investment quintiles across 2906 companies in that period. Startups who raised $300k or less in their seed raised Series As about 12% of the time. Founders who raised between $300k and $600k doubled their odds of raising an A to better than 24%, and those who raised between $600k and $900k increased the probability an additional 50%, reaching 33%. After that point, the marginal capital demonstrates diminishing returns. The data indicates that larger seed rounds substantially increase the odds of raising a Series A. This could be due to a number of reasons. First, founders with larger seed rounds benefit from more time to establish product market fit. Second, the additional capital enables seed stage startups to be more aggressive ramping the business either through marketing efforts, recruiting efforts or other tactics. Third, larger seed rounds likely have one or two institutional investors who have invested the substantial majority of the round, and given their larger fund sizes are willing and able to lead the Series A. More runway implies better odds of success.

In What’s Up with the Series A , Nikhil Basu Trivedi documents the bifurcation in the Series A market. While there are a handful of startups that raise blockbuster Series As of greater than $10M, the average Series A investment size remains relatively constant over the past 6 years just around $5.3M for US technology companies according to Crunchbase data[1]. After reading his post, I wondered if a big seed round is a leading indicator of a big series A. In other words, would larger seed rounds provide enough negotiating leverage in fundraising conversations to bolster average check sizes and increase pre-money valuations? Let’s go to the data. Below is a chart of 726 startups who raised a seed and a follow-on Series A anytime from 2005-2013. The x-axis is the size of the seed round in $k and the y-axis is the size of the Series A in $M. Each dot represents one startup. There isn’t a clear pattern within the data but we can make three important observations. First, Series As rarely exceed $10M for companies with seed stage financing and the distribution of these financings tends to be relatively independent of seed investment size. Second, in the top right, we see a cluster of large-seed and large Series A companies, but the sample size is quite small, only 4. Third, the correlation between the size of the seed round and the size of the Series A is tenuous at about 0.25 R^2. I can’t argue larger seed rounds precede larger As. But, there is a nugget of useful insight in the data. Below I’ve charted the distribution of seed investments by size on the left, and the distribution of Series A investmens by size on the right. They are quite different. Seed investments are uniformly distributed, but Series A investments follow a power-law distribution. Fundraising is never simple or easy, but there is a marked difference in the difficulty of raising a large seed compared to large A. Roughly 18% of startups in this data set raised a $1.5M+ series seed, but fewer than 8.5% of these startups raised a Series A of greater than $10M. Said another way, there is 3x more capital available for sub-$10M Series As than for greater than $10M As. In contrast, the amount of capital invested in seeds greater than $1M is about twice as big compared to small seeds, which is quite likely an artifact of the rise of the dedicated seed fund and traditional VCs’ entry into the seed market. All in all, larger seeds may not have a strong effect on the size of the Series A a startup can raise. But, at least at this point in the market, it’s becoming easier for founders to raise substantial seed rounds. [1] The numbers I’m using here differ from Nikhil’s because in addition to geography, I filtered the industry to tech companies, which seem to garner larger investments than the average Series A.

What should the optimal revenue per customer be for a SaaS company? I could say million dollar contracts typical of enterprise sales provide more long-term stability and total revenue opportunity. On the other hand I might contend larger customer bases paying smaller license fees enable more predictable growth. Which is the correct argument? First, lets examine the relationship between average customer value and total revenues, to see if smaller customers create a glass ceiling for total revenue. Below are two charts of data from venture-backed SaaS IPOs from 2010 to 2014. The chart on the left shows the average revenue per customer in $k at the time the company filed their S-1. The chart on the right shows the startup’s trailing twelve months’ revenue at the time of their S-1. Click for larger images. Tabular data is here . It’s clear that only a very weak relationship exists between the revenue per customer and total revenues. The small correlation between the two variables proves the point: R^2 is 0.3. In other words, entrepreneurs have built very large revenue companies with hundreds of thousands of small customers (Ring Central), a moderate number of medium sized customers (LinkedIn) and a small number of large customers (Veeva). In addition to revenue potential, we should consider the impact of average customer value on market capitalization/company value. Below, the box plot depicts the distribution of market capitalization broken down by the four quartiles of ACV:  $30k, $75k, $125k and $2M+ in average annual revenue per customer. Across the first three quartiles, the median market cap is identical. For these companies, the average customer value has very little impact on market cap. The $75k quartile has an upward bias in its distribution compared to the $30k and the $125k quartiles, an aberration caused by LinkedIn’s massive success selling $50k average annual licenses to about 4,000 customers at the time of the S-1. At first blush, the $2M quartile companies seem to garner 3x larger market caps. But, the table below shows this is a false conclusion. The $2M quartile companies wait to IPO until they generate 2 to 3x the trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue of the three smaller quartiles. Therefore, the difference in market cap multiples across quartiles isn’t substantial. Fourth quartile companies may delay their IPOs to assuage public market investors’ concerns about substantially higher customer concentration risk, since the total number of customers is in the low-hundreds. ACV Quartile Mean MC in $M Median MC in $M Average # of Customers Median TTM Revenue in $M <$30k 1,763 1,510 56,166 93 <$75k 6,348 1,875 2,717 88 <$125k 2,650 2,240 619 61 <$2M 7,363 6,150 465 150 ACV = Average Customer Value; MC = Market Cap; TTM = Trailing Twelve Months at S-1 filing. For some time, I’ve been wondering whether companies selling enteprise software contracts with long sales cycles are less attractive to investors than newer SaaS companies with high-velocity, low friction sales models. After all, this newer, high-velocity model provides much more predictability in sales processes. But the data indicates this isn’t the case. There is no optimal ACV to maximize for market cap or revenues, according to this data. Multi-billion dollar SaaS companies can be built serving customers, large or small.

OODA was a technique coined by John Boyd, one of the leading military thinkers of the last 100 years, based on the German’s Blitzkrieg-style warfare which prioritized speed and surprise over the traditional win, hold and grind attrition techniques of trench warfare. After @pmarca tweeted about the concept, I read one of the books on the topic called Certain to Win . Boyd’s thesis is that leaders of successful teams have to enable their organization to move rapidly, which means empowering people at all levels to make decisions. Speed is a huge asset in confrontations in both business and war, particularly when there is a substantial size difference between two competitors, so the author writes. According to Boyd’s philosophy, the way to enable teams to become agile is by using two frameworks each with four ideas, the Organizational Climate and OODA. For teams to act swiftly, Boyd reasons, they must share four cultural values. First, the team must have a shared mission. Second, the team must be singularly focused on a goal. Third, they must trust each other. This confidence is most often developed through shared experiences/hardship. Fourth, the team must have an intuition for the problem space, which more frequently than not comes from training, but sometimes raw talent. Intuition is critical for fast decisions. It’s easy to see these values embodied in a Navy Seals team, but a little harder to picture for a consumer marketing team or an enterprise sales team. The second framework is OODA. OODA is an acronym for Observe, Orient, Decide and Act. The ideas behind each step are straightforward, but the most important part of the process, which doesn’t have a letter in the acronym, is the debrief/feedback loop process that sends data back to the Observe step. My key takeaway from the book is leaders need to be disciplined about how they create the right cultures within their organizations, which means investing in team training, building trust among team members, setting a strong vision and creating an environment of candid and prompt feedback. But, I wish the book had more concrete examples about how to apply these frameworks on a tactical basis. Which types of training are the best for teams? How much time to invest in team building? What is the optimal way to build trust among colleagues? Today, there seem to be many different methods accomplish these goals. I suspect there are some best practices out there. I’m going to find some of these and write about them, in the hopes I can make the OODA and Organizational Climate ideas more immediately useful.

Given all the momentum of the NoSQL movement, it would be easy to write off SQL-based technologies as forgotten, or simply standing still. But there’s a tremendous amount of innovation occurring in SQL databases. Amazon’s Redshift, an elastic data-warehousing solution launched in late 2012 is the most salient example. Redshift’s ability to process huge volumes of data is breathtaking. When running Redshift on solid state drives (SSDs), one team at FlyData queried 1 terabyte of data in less than 10 seconds . AirBnB’s data science team 	wrote about their experiences contrasting Redshift and Hive . They found Redshift to be 20x faster at 25% the cost.	 Aggregate Knowledge shared their story of searching for a database system that permits linear scaling and quick access to same day data with Redshift Although Redshift adoption is still much smaller than other data-warehousing technologies, consider Github has 96 Redshift repositories compared 	to close to 1200 for Hive; and although Redshift is missing some important data processing features, the benefits of a cloud-based data-warehouse with familiar SQL syntax and tremendous speed will make Redshift the data-warehouse of choice for many analytics teams. The rise of Redshift creates opportunities for startups to create valuable products atop the cloud-based data-warehouse. First, it speeds product trial and adoption. For example, potential customers examining Looker’s product simply need to provision access to their Redshift instance to give it a whirl. Second, Redshift enables startups to focus on innovating in better design, application-level innovation and delivering insight rather than the infrastructure of data analysis. Redshift is a boon for analysts and data scientists who will benefit from the speed, cost and scalability of the system. In addition, the next-generation of data science startups will profit from the accelerated product adoption and sales models afforded by Redshift’s delivery model.

An entrepreneur asked me the question, what is the maximum viable churn for a startup? Within that question, a few others are embedded. How should a founder think about trading off efforts to grow revenue and mitigate churn? What is the impact of account growth on net churn? Startups must walk a tight-rope to balance growth, churn and cash. Below is the framework I use for working through maximum viable churn. ​ Startups with higher churn chew through more capital to maintain the same growth rate. Let’s compare four scenarios of a SaaS company with $1000 annual customer revenue, a 0.8 sales efficiency metric, implied cost-of-customer-acquisition of $1250	 and 3,000 customers generating $3M in annual revenue.
​ Monthly Churn 2% 3% 4% 5% Annual Churn 22% 31% 39		% 46% Churned Customers 646 918 1162 1379 CAC Spend to Recoup in $M 0.8 1.2 1.5 1.7 ​ ​	
The greater the churn, the more capital is required for the business just to maintain its revenue. In the case of the 5% monthly churn, the business would need to reinvest 60% of its total revenues, $1.7M, this year to keep revenue flat from year to year. The 2% monthly churn scenario requires less-than-half the capital. This makes sense because churn is a measure of how efficient a company is at retaining customer revenue. Since churn is directly tied to burn rate and the startup’s runway, the maximum viable churn rate for a business is the churn rate that enables the company to grow the fastest while raising the next round of capital at an attractive valuation. To me, that means targeting 18 to 24 months of runway post-Series A. ​
Let’s take a hypothetical SaaS company at a $2.5M annual run rate which raises a $5M Series A at 10x its ARR for a $25M post. Assuming the company would like to raise the next round at $50M post, the company would need to double its revenue. A 5% monthly churn rate wouldn’t work because the company would need to invest about $1.7M to sustain its revenues and another $3.75M to double its customers, totaling more than the $5M raised just for customer acquisition. At 1% monthly churn, the company could invest $0.8M to maintain its revenue and another $3.75M to add another 3000 customers, for a total investment of $4.6M, and within budget of the raise, ignoring for a moment the other costs of the startup. ​ In practice, churn rates vary by customer segment. Startups serving SMBs tend to operate with higher monthly churn, somewhere between 2.5% and 5%+, because SMBs go out of business with greater frequency and tend to be acquired and managed through less retentive channels, e.g. self-service. In the mid-market, which I’d define by average customer revenue of between $10k and $250k loosely speaking, the churn rates I’ve seen are between 1% and 2% per month. Enterprise companies, those with customers paying more than $250k per year are typically closer to 1%. ​
As the spend per customer grows, startups can afford to invest significantly more in retaining the customer , hence the improving rates. ​ The other dynamic at play that isn’t immediately apparent is the growth of customer accounts. In the mid-market and the enterprise, account growth from cross-sales and up-sales are common. Best-in-class companies are able to grow accounts by 3% to 4% per month. This account growth offsets churn. A company churning accounts at 3% but growing existing customers at 3% will have a net	 1.2% annualized revenue churn, compared to 31% without account growth. Because retaining existing customers is less expensive than finding new ones, investing in customer success to grow accounts is a far more cost-	effective way of mitigating churn than increasing customer acquisition spend.  	
​ The maximum viable churn for a company depends on the company’s runway and the rate at which the startup can grow accounts through up-sell and cross-sell. It goes without saying that less churn is always better, but estimating an upper-bound for churn can be helpful for financial modeling and internal prioritization of customer success efforts.

Aside from a startup’s internal considerations about the right time to raise money, founders should weigh the seasonality of the fund raising market when planning their raise. There’s a rule of thumb batted around the valley that the worst times to raise capital are in the dog-days of summer and after Thanksgiving. As it turns out, this aphorism is only a half-truth. Below is a chart of the dollars VCs have invested by month of year. I’m using Crunchbase data since 2005 for tech companies in the US. There are a few notable trends in the data. First, the impact of the summer is evident. The slowest months for fundraising are January-March and September. I’d estimate there are a few weeks latency in the data between when the investment commitment is made and the investment is disclosed. The legal diligence process of about 3-4 weeks that typically follows signing a term sheet introduces this lag. Second, setting aside the slowdown in summer, VCs invest more and more as the year progresses. It’s not crazy to draw a parallel between this trend and the patterns quota attainment for salespeople in which the majority of sales arrive in the last two weeks of a quarter. VCs aim to invest a certain amount of dollars and/or in a certain number of companies each year. The later in the year, the greater the time pressure, the better the motivation. Third, the difference from the best month, December, to the worst month, January, is substantial: a 50% delta in the total dollars invested and 50% increase in the number of investments. These differences are statistically significant with greater than 95% confidence, so seasonality quite clearly exists. This analysis raises another question: is there an optimal time of year to maximize the size of an investment and presumably pre-money valuation? The data shows the average investment size spikes in August and December, both of which have over the past nine years, generated 15% larger rounds. The difference is statistically significant with greater than 90% confidence. Assuming a three month fundraising process, the best times of year to start a financing process is in September, targeting a December close, when investment sizes are 15% larger than average and investment volumes are 50% larger. Starting a raise in May is the second best choice. While the average investment sizes are identical to December, investment pace is much slower, hence a bit riskier.

Last week, I spent some time at HeavyBit , the community for developer focused companies in SoMa, chatting with a few companies reaching scale. Across a handful of meetings, a recurring theme surfaced for these B2D (business-to-developer companies). How should their sales and marketing apparatuses be built? Do the field sales models of infrastructure companies or the inside sales models of software companies apply when the initial user is a developer? B2D companies are a special breed. They often begin as very small development projects, sometimes open-source, with a kernel of developers building a product to service their own needs, which gains some momentum and begins to grow. In this sense, B2D companies are similar to pure consumer companies. The product’s initial traction derives from word-of-mouth marketing, whether through forums, news sites, conferences github or Apache project pages. Sometimes, the momentum around a B2D product engendered by its community becomes so massive and generates such inertia that the company is catapulted into a revenues without much commercialization effort. The founding team just has to hold on. Examples include Github, whose online repositories became the de facto standard seemingly overnight or Twilio*, whose telephony API grew through the startup community and is now all but ubiquitous, or Stripe*, whose aloof culture has enshrouded the company in a mystique which attracts developers in hordes. But at some point in their lifecycles, B2D companies typically adopt the B2B go-to-market strategies SaaS companies seem to have perfected in the past few years: inside and outside sales teams, demand generation marketing teams and customer success teams. The metrics of cost-of-customer-acquisition, funnel conversion rates, upsell and cross-sell effectivess, net churn rates and lifetime value apply equally well to B2D companies as their SaaS cousins. The transition is demanded by larger customers who, allured by the innovation offered by new developer technologies, knock on the door with much fatter wallets, but commensurately higher expectations for service, features and support. To satisfy their needs, a B2D company must respond and change. They must learn to serve businesses. In addition, measuring funnels and establishing more predictable revenue patterns becomes important, for managing expenses, determining hiring plans and raising capital. A handful of B2D companies have coupled B2C efforts with the B2B strategy at launch. NewRelic and AppDynamics have melded these skills to dominate Application Performance Monitoring. Cloudera, MapR* and Horton launched with sales teams to capture the seemingly endless demand for Hadoop support. Others, like Heroku*, start as purely B2D and several years later, assemble sales and marketing teams to move up-market. The addition of B2B go-to-market methods to a B2C company can be challenging. For some teams, it feels like selling out. The original magic that made the company great has left, or something like that. Managing culture and employee sentiment during this transition is one of the biggest challenges for management teams. But it’s the right kind of growing pain. Because in order for the beautiful technology that initially started a movement to truly change the world and achieve its intended vision, a bridge has to be built from the authors of the technology to the rest of the market. That bridge is the sales and marketing teams, who discover, inform, educate and convince thousands of potential customers of the magic. To truly change the world, B2D companies must use every tool at their disposal, both in the B2C toolkit as well as the B2B. (*) Disclosure: Redpoint are investors in these companies.

While the phrase data scientist may be growing exponentially in its usage , and the number of data scientists job requisitions following a similar trend , the definition of the term is hard to pin down precisely. I wasn’t sure I could define it well until I watched a talk by Hilary Mason , former chief scientist at Bitly, called Dirty Secrets of Data Science at a NYC meetup. During the presentation, she highlighted a chart created by the Data Community DC team that demystifies term data scientist. Using a survey, the DCDC team recorded the major activities of 250 people calling themselves data scientists. Once collected, the team bucketed the activities (business, learning & big data, math, programming and stats) and named four different behavioral segments of data scientist: data businessperson, data creative, data engineer and data researcher. Each of these roles emphasizes different skills. The data businessperson focuses on answering business questions, such as forecasting the revenue for the business overt next year. Data creatives create data exploration experiences, like ones Amanda Cox and her team built at the NYTimes . The data engineer erects the infrastructure to answer questions for the business, e.g. Hadoop. Data researchers model data and develop algorithms to predict important things including which movie a consumer will want to see next, what ad should be displayed to a particular user at a particular time, and how much discount a user should be given to maximize loyalty. The diversity of these examples makes clear the day-to-day work of people calling themselves data scientists varies widely across five disciplines. Unfortunately, the word data scientist conflates all five types of work. For startups, this ambiguity makes hiring the right kind of data scientist a challenge. Most founders would likely point to the data businessperson. But the next question is what data infrastructure will that person need to perform their analyses? And so, is a data engineer required to build that infrastructure? Or will an existing engineer support them? Computer science has formalized refined roles for Ops, Back End Engineers, Front End Engineers, UX Designers, UI Designers and Product Managers. It seems to me the same process will happen with data scientists as we discover and uncover the different key roles and functions they serve in startups. DCDC’s analysis is a great first step at defining those roles and creating a lexicon for distinguishing among them.

When I worked as an engineer, I loved crafting code and feeling the satisfaction of having built something each day. But there was one thing about coding I never grew to love, despite its importance: forecasting my coding time. Every two weeks, I trudged into a planning meeting that exposed my incompetent forecasting. During these meetings, each person in turn would review their commitments for the last two weeks and provide an update. Inevitably, I was wildly off. Chalk it up to inexperience, exuberance or ineptitude, but I never developed the knack. In contrast, one of the companies I work with, Axial, has honed and refined their ability to forecast, promise and deliver code with remarkable consistency. A few quarters ago, the company implemented Joel Spolsky’s Evidence Based Scheduling techniques which enabled Axial’s engineering team to more than halve their release schedule times. Recently, Matt Story, head of engineering at Axial, spoke about the company’s transition. As the data in Matt’s presentation (embedded below) shows, the benefits to the company are hard to overstate. A dependable release schedule frees engineers to work uninterrupted, enables marketing and sales teams to make promises and meet their commitments to customers, and eliminates the familiar but stressful management by crisis. Predictability at Axial from Matt Story Evidence Based Scheduling is a simple but effective tool for orchestrating an engineering team. As here are three steps to implementing EBS. First, break down tasks into smaller chunks measured in hours. More granular estimates are more accurate. Second, passively measure each engineer’s actual times to completion and use the data to train the engineering team to estimate better. Third, forecast completion dates using simple Monte Carlo simulations. The data is incontrovertible. As Matt so elegantly phrases it in his slides embedded below, Predictability vs Speed is a false choice.

As recently as six months ago, it was easy to disregard the Internet of Things (IoT) as just a theoretical market that Cisco measured in the trillions , but whose potential never seemed to materialize. That’s all changing. The past year ushered in a new era for the Internet of Things for three reasons. First, venture capitalists invested nearly $1B of capital in the IoT in 2013, more than 3% of all VC investments by dollars. Second, the sector witnessed its first IPO, Control4 . And third, Nest’s sale to Google last week set the high water mark for IoT acquisitions, measured at more than $3B , firmly establishing the category as a strategic imperative for the world’s largest technology companies. The IoT momentum generated in 2013 will only continue to grow, as the number of connected device startups and products compounds, each looking to satisfy an unmet consumer want or enterprise need. By 2017, each consumer will have 5 connected devices , more than double today’s per capita figure, which potentially doubles the total revenue of the hardware market. To realize the true potential of the IoT dream, the development of connected devices must be made simpler and easier. In addition, all of these billions of new devices will need to communicate with each other, seamlessly. That’s why I’m so excited about the future for IoT companies, in particular Electric Imp . In the same way Amazon Web Services advanced online storage and computing infrastructure simplifying deployment and reducing launch costs sfor startups, Electric Imp frees innovators to focus on the things they do best - build great products. No longer do companies have to create back-end infrastructure and worry about connectivity, scalability and compatibility; they can focus on the design and differentiation of their product. 2013 was just the beginning for the IoT. With billions of new devices and innumerable new uses for them, our world will change dramatically over the next decade, fueled by the innovation of entrepreneurs building novel connected products.

Each year the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Reuters release data characterizing the state of the startup market. I’ve analyzed the 2013 data and there are three important trends I observed. All in all, the startup exit market is quite healthy. Startup exit values are increasing more than 7% per year, on average. The number of exits is flat-to-down during the ten year period I studied. The public markets have opened to startups again, doubling their share of exits. Over the past 10 years, startup exit valuations have increased 7% for IPOs and 10% for M&A annually.  If the trend continues, in 2014 the average material startup acquisition will reach $178M and the average startup IPO will raise $146M. Let me explain the phrase material startup acquisition. The average M&A price I’m quoting isn’t an average across all startups. The data set I’ve used includes only disclosed acquisitions, which are acquisitions that represent greater than 10% of the acquirors asset. The data set is skewed this way because publicly traded companies are only required to disclose these acquisitions by the SEC. Below is a chart comparing the total number of exits, both IPOs and major acquisitions, with the aggregate value of those exits over time. There are fewer exits but they are larger exits. I suspect this is driven primarily by the strength of the IPO market. Public investors have embraced startups and enticed them to go public instead of selling by offering cheap cash at hefty multiples at IPO . Growth stage investors, including hedge funds , have provided the extra growth capital to finance startups to IPO. This shift to IPOs is plain to see in the data, as the chart below shows. During the past two years, IPOs have nearly doubled their share of exit dollars to 45%, compared to a ten-year average of 28%. As a result, the corp dev teams of acquiring companies have to pay larger premiums to startups to allure them and instead of defraying their dollars over a large number of targets, these acquirors focus on fewer, more strategic bets. There were only 90 major acquisitions in 2013, compared to a ten-year average of 144, a 40% drop and statistically significant at 93% confidence. The data is almost universally positive for startups. Each year, startups’ exit price grows 3x faster than inflation. The public markets are more receptive to startup IPOs than at any other time in the past decade and the aggregate value of startup exits is on the rise. The only mildly negative data point is the volume of exits has fallen by 11%.

On the heels of last week’s post about the Health of the Public Technology Market , Felix Salmon asked the thought-provoking question above. Despite the 68x growth in the value of technology market caps since 1980, are newer average technology companies worth less? Surprisingly, yes. The average public tech company value has falled by more than 2/3rds from $4.3B in the early 80s to $1.4B today, as measured in 2014 dollars. Why is this the case? The industry has fragmented and players are pursuing smaller and smaller market opportunities, decreasing company size. The first technology companies were industry creators, monopolizing transistors and mainframes. In 1981, IBM was worth about $100B in 2012 dollars and represented 76% of global IT market cap across 28 companies. Total domination. As the industry grew by orders of magnitude, the typical tech company pursued smaller market opportunities with less market power, commanding lower revenues and consequently smaller valuations. So, the average tech company began to look much more like the average publicly traded company than the monolithic forefathers of the industry. Today, the average publicly traded tech company is about 60% smaller than the average company on the Nasdaq . The data supports this theory. The chart below shows the distribution of IT market caps over time. These publicly traded companies’ market caps fall into a normal distribution, clustered around $1.4B. I suspect this trend will continue until significant consolidation takes place, which is quite likely. Microsoft has $80B in cash; Apple, Google and Cisco each have $50B. With all that cash and growth paramount in importance , tech M&A in both private and public companies should be quite vibrant over the next few years.

Churn is one of the most important metrics for businesses. Churn dictates customer lifetime, lifetime value (CLV), customer acquisition spend and customer success spending. In short, churn is pivotal number to evaluate a startup’s business, both for founders/management teams and investors. Unfortunately, accurately measuring churn rates/lifetime value is more complex than I initially thought. I was researching the topic after Ryan Shank asked me how best to calculate an average customer’s lifetime value. The more I dug into the math, the deeper the rabbit hole went. Most companies calculate lifetime value with this formula: monthly_revenue x 1/monthly_churn_rate And that formula makes sense as this Snowplow presentation explains and this Wikipedia on geometric series entry shows . The problem is there are three major assumptions in the formula: The churn rate from month to month is consistent The churn rate from customer to customer is consistent The business’s offering is consistent (pricing, competitive dynamics) None of these hold true for most businesses. In practice, Custora found LTV estimates can be more than 2x greater than reality . Let’s look at why this happens. I’ve modeled four different types of customer retention curves below, each with the same 3.5% average monthly churn, but with wildly different customer behaviors. I’ve seen businesses with all four types of churn characteristics from gaming companies to SaaS companies to ecommerce subscription companies. Annual Renewals : 1.5% of these customers churn each month and at each 12 month period, when it’s time to renew a big contract, another 25% churn. Cliff : in the first month, 70% of customers churn. In the second month, 22% of customers churn. Then only 1% of customers churn each month. Constant : a steady 3.5% monthly churn per month. Declining : churn starts at zero and increases 0.25% each month. Below is a chart showing the percentage of a cohort retained over time under each model. Click to enlarge it. But here’s the money graph: the customer lifetime value under each of the models assuming a $50 per month fee for across 3 years. The three models are relatively consistent and vary by about 25%. The last one, the cliff, is 75% lower. Given all this variance, if you’re looking for a simple way of calculating LTV more conservatively, you might change the formula above to monthly_revenue x 1/monthly_churn_rate x 0.75 and haircut the estimate by 25% or 30%. A slightly better approach would be to perform this analysis by customer segment. First it requires understanding the customer base and their behaviors. How many segments in the customer base exist? What is each customer segment’s churn curve (are they cliff customers or constant customers? And what fraction of does each segment represent? But, as the Custora data shows , the best way to calculate churn requires a lot more math, using Bayesian modeling. There are some great papers explaining this approach, like this one from UCLA . Churn rates and LTV are challenging to predict with accuracy and while rules of thumb like the formulas above may be reasonable guidelines, it’s important to be aware of their tendency to overestimate lifetime value, as Jason Cohen explains here . Because a 2x overestimate of customer lifetime can radically change a startup’s unit economics, deeply understanding churn behaviors is crucial to making a startup’s business model viable.

In “Why Winning Streaks End” , Rosabeth Kantar, a professor at HBS, explains the key to maintaining momentum in any company is maintaining the discipline of every day processes. Similarly, Atul Gawande’s book Better echoes this idea. For surgeons, the best way to keep patients safe and healthy is ticking through a checklist before each surgery. As I’ve watched a handful of startups grow, the pattern I see emerging from most of them is their ability to persistently transform chaos into process. And then continuously improve the way they do things. At the beginning, each of these companies pursued product development with something akin to Lean Startup Method. The founders identified a problem, spoke with customers and quickly iterated their solution into products the market would buy. After the prototypes were built, the founders needed more help building the product and developed a process to hire engineers to grow the development team. Next, these companiess shifted into sales and marketing mode, pitching and selling potential customers. In so doing, they defined and refined their go-to-market process. When the customer acquisition methods were somewhat in place, these startup created a third process to recruit salespeople and build a marketing organization. And so on for customer support, sales operations, human resources, finance and every other key activity of a business. Once in place, these processes can’t remain static. Processes must stay relevant and productive through persistent improvement. This means using software to instrument processes, charging team leaders with the responsibilities to create new ways of doing things and pushing the company towards rapid improvement. For some, the word process has a strongly negative connotation. It’s probably because we often notice the processes that don’t work: the line at the DMV, the vacation time approval or airplane boarding. While those may need some work, we shouldn’t simply throw the baby out with the bathwater and pan all processes. Code check-in regimens, hiring procedures, OKR setting routines, annual reviews - all of these work and to great benefit of the employees, teams and company. What was Zynga’s Playbook for launching games if not a list of proprietary processes? Broadly speaking, I think this means startups need two skill sets as they grow: the ability to design processes and the ability to maintain/improve/destroy processes as the business evolves.

I’ll never forget the first time I was assigned a sales quota. I was six months into a sales role at Google in which I on-boarded and managed the accounts of social networks running AdSense ads. Our key metric was customer satisfaction and retention. After a few months, I was starting to get into a groove. And then, our team was assigned a new manager who put the team on a quota, sending me into a tailspin. I was daunted by the quota. I asked myself if I might ever be able to hit the number and doubted that I could. I fell into a crisis of confidence. How would I add $X of additional revenue this year? I remembered my quota trauma while reading an article by Jason Jordan, a sales management training consultant, who wrote about the three kinds metrics that matter for sales teams : Business Results, Sales Metrics and Sales Activities. Business Results are the revenue growth figures for a company at the highest level. Sales Objectives are the goals of each sales team: acquiring brand-name customers, growing customer accounts or hitting a quota. Sales Activities are outbound sales calls, writing account plans and qualifying leads. Jordan makes a great point in his post, that the only type of metric sales teams can effect are the tactical Sales Activities. Unfortunately, most sales teams only measure Sales Metrics, so it’s challenging to diagnose why salespeople miss quota. He argues sales managers should focus their sales teams on Sales Activities and measure those leading indicators in addition to Sales Metrics which are lagging indicators of success. In my interpretation, that means sales managers ought to set a quota, and in addition, outline a general plan (total number of calls, target sales sizes, conversion rates) for how to accomplish that quota. This enables the sales team to understand how they are tracking towards the Sales Metrics and allows them to diagnose where the sales funnels might be under or over-performing. I’m sure the most successful sales teams have instrumented the Sales Activity metrics Jordan talks about, because it’s a very logical thing to do: dig deeper into the sales process to understand how to improve it. But I wish I had read Jordan’s post all those years ago.

For Google, seasonality is an important factor in forecasting quarterly revenue growth. In the advertising business, Q4 is always the strongest, followed by Q1. Q2 is the weakest. In Google’s latest financial year, the difference between the weakest and strongest quarters was 22%: $14.4B in Q4 and $11.8B in Q2. I wondered if the same were true for SaaS companies. Should SaaS startup forecasts account for differences in underlying customer purchasing habits? While not subject to the consumer buying holiday cycle like advertising based companies, SaaS salespeople might be impacted by the vacation schedules of their customers or some other factors I couldn’t anticipate. But the data show seasonality is largely irrelevant to SaaS companies, even the very largest ones. Below I’ve charted the quarterly revenue growth patterns of the 40 or so publicly traded SaaS companies. I’ve indexed revenue growth to Q1, meaning a Q2 value of 200% implies a Q2 that is twice as large in revenue as Q1 and so on for each subsequent quarter. While there are outliers whose Q4s are the worst performing quarters (Ariba, BazaarVoice, E2Open and Concur), the vast majority of public SaaS companies grow through the year, unfazed by the summer doldrums of Q3 and the holiday slowdown in Q4. Below is a table with the average revenue by quarter indexed to Q1. Across all public SaaS companies, Q4 is on average about 28% larger than Q1. Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Revenue Indexed to Q1 1.00 1.05 1.11 1.28 I suspect some of the strength in Q4 might be budget liquidation. Before year end, VPs may find excess funds and seeking to maintain their budget size for next year, stuff additional SaaS products into their budgets. But otherwise, revenue seems to grow at a fairly consistent pace. This table makes plain one of the benefits of the recurring revenue model: predictability. The linearity of revenue growth across sectors and ages of companies implies SaaS companies aren’t subject to the same seasonality forces of other segments and sectors.

Yesterday, I walked the sprawling floor of the Consumer Electronics Show. These are the six key themes/trends I noted. The Coming of Era of Drones - I saw barrel-rolling quad-copters and parkouring wheeled robots dancing in synchrony to hiphop music. It was awe-inspiring and terrifying at the same time.  If you watch the video, I think you’ll agree the mechanisms to control drones are rapidly becoming more sophisticated. Setting aside regulatory questions, there seem to be fewer and fewer barriers to large scale drone deployments in the very near future. The Internet of Things is Going Away - The moniker, not the movement, is disappearing.  Internet of Things companies don’t sell themselves as such. Instead of focusing on the tech, home security companies and wireless speaker companies and sensor companies and healh companies pitch value instead of technology. The Reinvention of the Car - BMW’s i3, an electric city car, was ubiquitous and seemed to integrate with a great many services . Google announced the Open Automobile Alliance to enable more innovation within the car. I saw self-driving cars, Toyota’s hydrogen fuel-cell concept , Audi’s new screen/dials , and Ford’s entirely solar-powered car , which they claim can recharge its batteries from the sunlight in any US city. There’s rapid innovation in the powertrain and the software/electronics of the car. Not coincidentally, these are probably the two most important axes of differentiation for car makers in the next decade. Searching for the Next Massive Hardware Market - Manufacturers are testing every permutation of device to find the next big success and releasing some Franken-devices in the process. The 10-inch consumer tablet shares the floor with a 12-inch pro-tablet . The mobile phone with camera sits next to a 21x optical zoom camera/phone . I saw tablets with keyboards and without, tablets with dual-booting operating systems, and even tablets without screens. These headless computers are little portable bricks of compute and storage that are designed to be connected and disconnected from screens at work and home. And of course, there’s the seemingly perennial SMS-enabled refrigerator or washing machine. In short, there was lots of spaghetti thrown on the walls and it’s unclear if any of the experiments will work or how large of a market any one of these niches represents. Commodification of Wearable Technology - I couldn’t tell the wearable technology products apart. Each of them report similar diagnostics. The form factors for watches, pedometers, scales and heart rate monitors aren’t distinguishable from each other. Some are differentiating on style and fashion. None of the software accompanying the devices seemed unique either. The commodification trend will continue until one of two things occurs. Either one competitor develops a proprietary sensor/analysis that resonates with the mass-market consumer, or one company amasses enough users to become the de facto social and data hub for health information. Hunting for TV’s New Killer Feature - It seems to be harder and harder to sell TVs, and the manufacturers are trying harder and harder. The 4K curved OLED screens are technical marvels and render stunning images. But these visual innovations don’t seem to provide the must-have-it factor of the original high-definition TVs. The content isn’t available at scale to demonstrate the quality advantages and the technology is rapidly approaching the limits of the human eye. All these order-of-magnitude improvements in displays seem to provide diminishing returns to the consumer. If anything, the TV might be replaced by… AR/VR is Back - The momentum Oculus Rift and Google Glass have mustered has created a wake of clones and adjacent experiences. One startup showed an Oculus Rift connected to a mock assault rifle and a treadmill-like walking surface. Players can run and point and shoot in Call of Duty, so the idea goes. There was quite a bit of innovation. Overall, the three areas I came away most excited about for startups are: AR/VR , drones and inside-the-car.

Tien is the founder and CEO of Zuora [1], and was formerly CMO and CSO at Salesforce. He is a brilliant marketer and created the notion of the three doors to SaaS success. He spoke about this innovation at a recent CMO summit; the video is here. If you visit Zuora’s website, you’ll see Zuora’s three doors along the top of the page: Subscription Economy, Why Zuora & How It Works. Those are the three most important navigation links on the page. Each door answers one key question for prospective customers. The Subscription Economy page describes the Market. In particular, what changes in the market must customers respond to? It’s the hook to encourage visitors to read more. The second door is the gateway to the Value Proposition. Zuora puts it very directly, Why Zuora? Each element on the page describes the benefit of the product both in the company’s and in customers words. The value proposition is laid out for different industries and key roles in the purchasing process. The last door, How It Works, describes the product at a high level. It answers the question of how Zuora completes its value proposition promise. Most importantly, the third door tees up the next step, contacting the Zuora sales team. Tien Tzuo’s three doors is a simple framework for creating SaaS websites that tell customers a story of why they ought to use a product. It’s concise and elegant and a simple way to organize content for SaaS companies. Thanks to Allison Tepley who inspired this post and to Mike Brown of Bowery Capital who sent me the link to the video. [1] Redpoint are lucky enough to be investors in Zuora.

In the last 35 years, the tech industry has exploded in size from $62B in total market cap to more than $9.7T today, as the chart above shows. In that time, the tech industry has birthed some behemoths. In 2013, Apple became the largest publicly traded company, the first time a technology company held that distinction. Despite the number of massive companies built over the past three decades, these tech giants represent an increasingly small amount of the total value in the technology sector.  In 1981, the top ten technology companies represented 95% of the global IT market cap. Today, that share has fallen to 26% and the ratio continues to fall, a very positive trend. This fragmentation is an indicator of how much opportunity exists for startups to seize. If the tech industry were consolidating it would indicate the very largest tech companies were leveraging their market power to win share. The gradual reduction in market cap concentration is driven by the huge growth in the total number of publicly traded companies to 6037 from 37 in that time span, a 17.6% CAGR in publicly traded tech companies over the past 30 years. Also, geographic diversification has been an important factor. Three of the largest 10 tech companies today are outside the US: China Mobile ($208B), Vodafone ($190B) and Samsung ($170B). I expect that trend to continue. Interestingly, the typical market cap of a tech company hasn’t changed over time, at a median of roughly $1.6B. But the ratio between the average and the largest company has exploded from 22x to more than 310x, meaning today, Apple is 310x the size of the average publicly traded tech company. The big are getting bigger. Looking historically at the trends in the public tech market and turning toward 2014 and beyond, the tech market is vibrant and healthy. It’s a terrific time to be starting and growing technology companies.

Earlier this week, Zappos declared they will abandon traditional management structure for holacracy , a management ethos that eschews pyramids and hierarchy in favor of self-organizing groups, called holons. It’s not a structure without management, but one of distributed authority and management. Below is a schematic describing holacracy at a high level. Holacracy has been adopted by a handful of other companies including David Allen’s company , the blogging platform Medium and some non-profits. Valve and 37Signals also seem to have adopted some of these ideas too.  But Zappos may be the biggest company to adopt this management style yet. I’m excited to see how the transition goes because Tony Hsieh’s success could start a broad management movement. The biggest challenge for executive teams is attracting, retaining and maximizing the talent of their people. According to a McKinsey survey of 1k+ people conducted in 2009, the top three ways to motivate people are praise from a manager, attention from leaders and opportunities to lead new projects. My understanding is that holacracy was developed in response to those problems. Holacracy should enable employees to create projects on-the-fly and assemble teams as needed. This should make employees more productive and happier. If it works as intended, holacracy should also reduce the amount of time the company’s management team spends on decision-making and general administration of the business by pushing it to employees, granting executives more time to spend with different groups. I’m reading and learning about holacratic management practices at holacracy.org . Some of the questions I have about it are: how does holacracy change the roles of the management team? How difficult it is to train employees in a new working style? Will the benefits of employee happiness ultimately materialize?  I’m not certain this structure is right for every organization, or even for which companies benefit most from it, but it does seem like an important management prototype worth digging into.

Like many others, during my work day I fall into the firefighting trap, a time mis-allocation problem that leaves me focusing on urgent, but not necessarily important tasks. Firefighting is addictive because it’s fast-paced, nonstop and fun. But firefighting is exhausting and leaves me feeling as if I haven’t made progress toward my goals. In addition, firefighting inhibits effective time allocation. A week can pass and I find that the non-urgent but important projects like preparing for a board meeting and researching a new sector like Bitcoin have been starved for time. Or I look up and realize I’ve been spending most of my time on urgent but not-important things, like returning huge volumes of email. Last week, I came across an issue of Harvard Business Review called “Find Your Focus: Getting Things Done the Smart Way." The issue is worth reading in its entirety because it reprints all the research of management effectiveness to grace an HBS page in the past ten years or so. Most of the content is available on the web for free. In the issue, the authors focus exclusively on being effective, not productive. It’s a semantic difference perhaps, but an important one. One article in particular resonated with me. Called “ Making the Most of Slow Time ”, the article highlights a framework Steven Covey created called the Prioritization Matrix, which I’ve reprinted here. The idea underpinning the PM is to stop at each point when starting a task and asking is this urgent and is it important? If so, then complete the task. If not, then either delegate the task if it can be done by someone else, dump the task because it’s neither important nor urgent, or schedule a time to handle the non-urgent but important task. Asking this simple question helps prioritize the urgent and important tasks and ensures that the non-urgent, but important tasks like board meeting preparation, have time allocated to them. Since coming across the Bullet Journal six months ago, I’ve become an adopter of the note-taking technique and it’s helped me keep organized. In 2014, I’m going to resolve to append Us and Is to each task in the bullet journal, in the hopes I’ll be more effective.

According to the WSJ, GoPro is the largest consumer hardware IPO in 23 years , though like most entrepreneurs, I don’t remember the Duracell IPO. The last consumer hardware company IPO I remember is Tivo, which was in 1999. Because GoPro is the first sizable consumer hardware IPO in eons and because the startup world has a blossoming hardware segment, I thought it would be interesting to compare and contrast a top consumer hardware startup with the benchmarks of public SaaS companies using GoPro’s S-1 . I have three goals with this analysis. First, to understand GoPro’s business better. Second, to benchmark GoPro’s capital needs, capital efficiency and attractiveness to investors. Third, to draw conclusions for other hardware startups. Founded in 2004, GoPro is about 10 years old and during the past few years has witnessed spectacular growth. In its sixth year in business, the company generated $65M in revenue and in its ninth year, just short of $1B. The revenue figures and the annual growth rates of the business are depicted in the chart above. It’s astounding for a business generating $500M in annual revenue to grow more than 100% in a year. In comparison, the median public SaaS company grew 40-58% in years six through nine , reaching about $100M in revenue. To be fair, there are significant differences in the subscription revenue of SaaS companies and the one-time, transactional revenue of a consumer hardware business. In particular, subscription business is far more predictable than consumer purchasing habits. The second major difference in revenue is the gross margin. GoPro’s gross margin has dropped from 50% to 37% in four years. The chart above shows the decrease in gross margin. The company has witnessed an increase in the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in the past few years. According to the GoPro S-1, COGS include the components of the camera, the shipping costs, the selling costs, warranty and replacement costs, and write downs for excess inventory. SaaS companies benefit from the elasticity of the cloud. As a result, there is no true need to predict demand aside from hiring the staff to support customers. Consequently, public SaaS companies operate with a 67% average gross margin, roughly twice that of GoPro. Let’s dig a bit deeper into GoPro’s cost structure. The chart above shows the four different expense categories GoPro reported in its S-1: Advertising, General and Administrative, Research and Development, and Sales and Marketing. I’m not intimately familiar with the company but I’ll hypothesize about the trends behind this data. Advertising expenditures have fallen as a percentage of revenue. Perhaps the company has de-emphasized ads a growth channel because the brand has become synonymous with the category and the majority of the market is aware. G&A expenses have likely fallen as revenues have increased dramatically, but staff have grown at a slower rate. R&D expense seems to is increasing. Given the amount of competition in the market from Contour, Sony, Canon and others , and that the product is using, as far as I know, commodity semiconductor and optical components, GoPro must continue to invest in product differentiation including better cameras and better software, which they provide for free . Selling and marketing expenses increased and fell. I suspect GoPro sells most of their hardware through retailers. As the company has increased its sales throughput, it likely has been able to negotiate much better terms with retailers, thus decreasing selling and marketing expenses. These investment trends, particularly the R&D investment trends differ substantially from SaaS companies , which spend more than twice as much in Sales and Marketing, about 50% of revenue, and about twice as much in R&D -  about 20%. Because SaaS companies have substantially higher gross margins, they can afford to invest more in both functions. Let’s look at GoPro’s Net Income trends. The company has been profitable for the past four years at least, but before its IPO, Net Income fell to about 5% of revenues. Contrast this trend with the average of -18% Net Income of the average SaaS company. SaaS companies have been telling the market that the long lifetime values of subscription customers enables higher spending to achieve higher growth. Again, this ties back to the difference between transactional revenue and subscription revenue. GoPro aims to be profitable with one customer on the first transaction, hence better profitability. One of the refrains about hardware businesses is their capital inefficiency. Because hardware companies must spend money to manufacture goods and typically are only paid once the consumer buys the device, hardware startups may have huge amounts of money tied in working capital . But GoPro bucks this trend. In a previous analysis of SaaS companies, I calculated a figure called Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), which is the ratio between the revenues of the company the year it went public to the amount of venture dollars raised. In other words, how many revenue dollars did one invested VC dollar create. The average for the most recent SaaS publics is 2.0, two dollars of revenue per investment dollar. GoPro’s ROIC is 3.4: $288M raised and nearly a $1B in revenue. Amazingly, GoPro is 50% more capital efficient than the average SaaS company. Of course, GoPro does have a debt line of about $100M to finance inventory. The median SaaS company with debt, operates with $55M in short and long term debt, for comparison. Given all those data points, how ultimately does an incredibly fast-growing, relatively high-margin consumer hardware company perform in the public markets compared to SaaS companies? GoPro more than doubled in its first few days of trading and as of today, the company trades at a ratio of 5.3x (Enterprise Value to LTM Revenue), which is precisely half of the average SaaS company. There’s no question GoPro is an exceptional company, and it wouldn’t be an overstatement to call it a once-in-a-generation company. Now worth more than $5B, GoPro is a terrific example of what is demanded of a consumer hardware company to become publicly traded. GoPro defined a category, developed a brand, sustained amazing growth rates and has invested to attract new customers and defend its existing customer base. It’s a great role model for hardware startups to follow.

You’re walking down the hallway at work from one meeting to the next. A colleague or report stops you en route, asks for a minute and presents an important problem. It’s easy to respond with “let me think about it” and duck into the meeting. In that half-second, all the responsibility of the decision has been transferred. Unlike a minute ago, you have the monkey on your back. The challenge with these situations is two-fold. First, you’re unlikely to have enough information to make a decision. Second, no time has been allocated to solving the problem. Multiply this event by 3 or 4 times per day, every working day, and it’s easy to see why these hallway conversations create massive bottlenecks in organizations. Everyone is talking but no one is deciding or acting. Organizational inertia sets in and the company’s rate of execution grinds to a halt. William Oncken, Jr, who founded a management coaching company, developed a strategy to help managers handle monkeys . When faced with a monkey, a report has five choices: Wait for instruction Ask for help Suggest an action and ask for permission Act, but inform immediately Act and wait until the next 1/1 meeting to inform Oncken reasoned that the first two options are the worst because they encourage monkeys to propagate through hallway conversations like the one above. Instead, managers should trust their reports to pursue options 3 through 5. Each of these three options requires a follow up meeting and a schedule of updates that should allocate enough time to discuss how best to deal with the monkey. Ultimately, enforcing this practice builds trust among the team, empowers team members to evaluate and resolve problems, develops employees’ skills, all while increasing a manager’s effectiveness, a win-win outcome. Oncken’s technique for managing monkeys ensures continuity in business processes, preventing managers from becoming bottlenecks and empowering reports to act quickly and effectively. It’s a good technique to maintain top execution speed. This post is part four of a series including How to Structure a Sales Team , Situational Management and Startup Team Sizes

One way of measuring the efficiency of a company’s revenue model is to benchmark revenue per employee. Google and Facebook, the two most efficient companies, generate $1M per revenue per employee per year . Setting aside those exceptional cases and focusing instead on SaaS companies, the typical average revenue per employee is about $190k to $210k per year. The histogram above shows the ranges for publicly traded SaaS companies. In the scatterplot above, which compares revenue per employee to revenues (in log10 scale), the outliers pop out. Financial Engines (FNGN) is the most efficient publicly traded SaaS company at $500k in revenue per employee and LifeLock isn’t far behind. Salesforce (CRM) and LinkedIn (LNKD) are much closer to the average range while other darlings like WorkDay (WDAY) and Tableau (DATA) are close to $100k. Revenue per employee isn’t a leading indicator of success, but a lagging one. It’s also a composite metric that is negatively impacted by significant waves of hiring, sales team ramp time, product and company maturity in a market and many other factors. Notably, there isn’t much of a correlation between the revenue per employee and total revenues (R^2 of 0.2) or market cap (R^2 of 0.06), so revenue per employee doesn’t seem to limit the growth of company or hamper valuation. All of this means revenue per employee isn’t a metric to optimize for. Rather it’s a helpful as broad benchmark of the general efficiency of a business and a place to start analyzing employee productivity if a business deviates too much from the comparables.

Financial statements are a Rosetta Stone for startups . They reveal the strategies and the tactics of how to bring a product to market. These are the ten metrics I look at when sifting through a startup’s operational model, whether when considering an investment or in a board meeting. Revenue growth indicates how quickly a company can grow under the current way of doing business. The top line shows whether the market affords steady growth (SaaS) or lumpy revenue growth created by the long sales cycles of big customers (Telecom) and whether the company must sell one product or a collection of complementary products. The revenue growth projections indicate the potential of the business. The Net Income, aka bottom line or burn rate if negative, is the revenue minus all the costs incurred. Net Income dictates the minimum amount a startup needs to raise to become profitable. By comparing Cash, Net Income and Revenue, I can calculate when a startup will need to raise its next round, what its financial profile might be when it does go to market and get a sense of follow-on financing risk . Gross margin is a measure how expensive it is make the product. It’s calculated by taking the revenue and subtracting all the COGS (costs of goods sold), which in software businesses includes serving and hosting costs, software licenses used, and revenue share agreements in the case of ad networks. Most software businesses have gross margins of 80% or more, which make them very attractive. On the other hand, grocery stores operate at 30% gross margin. Gross margin is the glass ceiling of profitability because the net margin can never exceed the gross margin. Contribution margin measures profit per unit, without considering fixed costs. To calculate contribution, take the total revenue generated by selling one unit and subtract the variable costs to sell that unit. Selling and marketing costs tend to form the bulk of contribution margin costs in software companies. The greater the contribution margin, the more profitable the business on a unit basis, the more sales and marketing dollars can be spent to acquire customers and fuel growth. Contribution margins range from 5% to 25% depending on the sector. Of course, contribution margin has to be put into context. The contribution margin of producing a kilowatt of energy from a fusion reactor might be nearly 99%, but the fixed costs are measured in the billions. Contrast that with a 15% contribution margin ecommerce business which requires only $25M to become profitable. Which is more attractive? Customer acquisition payback period or sales efficiency is a gauge for how aggressive a company can be marketing and selling its services. The longer the payback period, the greater the risk that a customer churns and the marketing dollars paid to acquire the customer are lost, and vice versa. The most efficient businesses I’ve seen recover their customer acquisition cost in 6 months. A 12 month recovery window is more typical. In SaaS startups, the payback period tends to be the driver for moving from monthly pricing to annualized contracts because it eliminates the profitability risk of a customer. Churn quantifies the revenue potential of each customer. A 3% monthly churn rate, which is typical of public SaaS companies , implies most customers will only hang around for 2 years. The greater the churn, the more challenging revenue growth becomes over time . This often means a company will stimulate demand using paid acquisition, decreasing contribution margin and impacting profitability. The single biggest expense for most startups is salary. By looking at salaries across functional areas, I can get a sense for how a startup pays its employees relative to market rates. Low salaries could spell employee retention questions in the future. Excessive salaries reduce the company’s runway. I compare salaries to a set of benchmarks across venture backed companies as a litmus test. Sales quotas provide indications of how easily the product is sold and how well run the sales team is. Inside sales quotas vary from $150k to $600k per year and enterprise sales quotas vary from $1M to $2M, depending on the product . At the early stages of a startup, I tend to value consistency: smaller deal sizes but more predictable deal velocity (number of customers closed per week). Non-personel marketing spend is the most significant controllable expense in a business. It typically includes ad spending and event spending. This expense bucket can be turned on and off from month to month unlike salaries or rent. It’s important to me because it provides an indicator of how well understood the marketing process has become. For most startups I’ve seen, demand generation budgets range from 5 to 20% of total expenses. The optimal ratio depends on the payback period. Revenue per employee. The beauty of software businesses is their leverage. Google’s market cap is 40% larger than Walmart but it has only 2% the size of Walmart’s employee count. Revenue per employee is a measure of how efficient a business is in using technology to bring their product to market. Some sectors and products intrinsically need more people to be sold.

On January 8, 1966, the New Yorker profiled Buckminster Fuller for the first time. During a trip to a Maine island with the journalist Calvin Tomkins, Fuller said something tremendously prescient: Fuller proposed a worldwide technological revolution…[that] would take place quite independently of politics or ideology; it would be carried out by what he calls “comprehensive designers” who would coordinate resources and technology on a world scale for the benefit of all mankind, and would constantly anticipate future needs while they found ever-better ways of providing more and more from less and less. Fuller’s prediction has come true. The founders of the tech companies embody the values of the comprehensive designers and enact the changes Fuller predicted. From Google investing $100M behind Calico, a life extension research company to Khan Academy which extends high-quality education into the hands of hundreds of millions of people to Twitter which has become the mouthpiece of revolutions and countless others to SpaceX which has dramatically decreased the cost of space transport to Oxford Nanopore which sequences DNA on a chip the size of a USB drive, these products and the comprehensive designers behind them have benefitted mankind tremendously. The most important part of the quote for me is the last phrase: the constant improvement and reinvention. That’s what makes technology so exciting. Industries are constantly under threat of disruption, innovation and change. Welcome to the era of the comprehensive designer.

The traditional theoretical price demand curve is often drawn like this. The chart makes two points: there is some relationship between price and demand / revenue opportunity, and customer segments underpin that relationship. Each segment demands different products to satisfy different needs and presents a different revenue/profit opportunity. Even if the details are very hazy, price demand curves are useful tools to inform product strategy and prioritization. To make PD curves useful requires marketing research. It means identifying customer segments, estimating the the demand of each segment, quantifying the investment required to build the right product, and uncovering the costs of acquiring and servicing customers within that segment. After all that, there’s also a process of testing various price points to get a better sense of price elasticity. All of these are useful in the process of establishing product market fit. In most cases, the demand curve is not a straight line. Sometimes the demand curve can be parabolic. Sometimes it has kinks. Sometimes the curve comprises ten segments and other times just three. Let’s look at a sketch of a freemium demand curve. Expensify initially offered a free product. Faced with skepticism from customers about the trustworthiness of entirely free product, Expensify launched a $5 pricing plan and then the demand for the product grew substantially. By establishing even a very modest price, Expensify engendered trust and credibility with its customers, who became willing to submit credit card details, shifting the demand curve and creating a revenue opportunity. Expensify’s example highlights another important point: demand curves aren’t static. They change with the introduction of new features, sales efforts in educating the market and entry of competitors, among other factors. Below is a hypothetical SaaS company’s price/demand curve evolving over time. The company begins with an SMB focused product which elicits no demand from Enterprise customers. After launching a management product with single-sign on features, auditing and other features desired by the enterprise market, the demand curve matures to the one on the right. Price/demand curves are very simple models of customer ecosystem, but they are good frameworks for discussing a startup’s product evolution, particularly in more established markets. With a little bit of work, they can be used to compare the revenue opportunities afforded by different customer segments and answer the question of which product/feature does the company build next.

Raising money for a startup is expensive. The typical legal fees for a Series A are about 1% of the total money raised: roughly $40k on $4M. Of course, this doesn’t factor in the time for the process and the dilution of the investment. But if your startup is considering an IPO be prepared to pay eight times as much in fees. Across 360 venture backed technology IPOs in the last 10+ years which on average raised $107M, 8.8% of the dollars the startup raises in the initial public offering is paid to investment banks, accountants and attorneys. Below is a chart of the fee breakdown. Along the x-axis are calendar years. The y-axis shows the percent of the dollars raised which are immediately paid in fees. Investment banking/advisor fees are shown in red and receive the lion’s share. Legal fees, primarily for writing the prospectus and ordering the company’s affairs, and accounting fees for auditing and preparing the financials, are marked in green and blue. The average fee hasn’t changed much in the past decade except for 2012. The blip in 2012 is an abberation caused by Facebook’s IPO which raised $17B and paid $182M in fees, representing only 1% of the dollars raised. Facebook’s huge IPO and significantly lower fees raises the question, do larger IPOs pay less in fees? The chart below, which compares IPO size to the proportion of fees paid, answers that question. The x-axis shows the IPO size in Log10, so the number 2 corresponds to $100M raised, and the y-axis shows the fee share. Larger IPOs do command lower fees (the R^2 is about 0.44 indicating a moderate amount of correlation), but so do a handful of smaller IPOs like Google and Zynga, among 18 others with fees less than 5% of the amount raise. Exceptional companies, those that will likely do very well trading in the public market, command lower fees because many providers are vying for the business and willing to reduce their margins to win the trophy customer. Going public has many benefits including access to far larger pools of capital, greater share liquidity and PR. Among the costs involved in the process, service provider fees are some of the most significant and sap nearly 10% of the proceeds.

When startups are acquired, there are many considerations in accepting an offer. Does the vision of the acquirer fit the startup? Will the startup operate independently or be integrated? What is the price and structure of the transaction? Most of these questions have to be answered through extensive conversations with suitors. As for the structure of the acquisition, there’s data that can be used for benchmarking. I’ve assembled about 2400 M&A events of venture-backed technology companies since 2000 to compare the fraction of the total consideration which is stock and cash. There are two trends in the data: how the cash/stock split changes over time and how the split changes with the size of the outcome. The first chart below shows the trends by size. The x-axis shows the Acquisition Value in $M and the y-axis shows the cash share. Each circle is one transaction. Three conclusions are evident from the chart. First, 83% of these acquisitions were cash only. Only 1.5% of transactions were consummated with less than 10% of the value in cash. Second, the larger the transaction the more likely stock will play a significant role. The table below shows the trend of the average cash split falling from 92% to 57% for the very largest M&A. Third, a power law governs acquisitions. 50% of transactions had values of $50M or less; 64% of transactions were for less than $100M. Exit Price in $M Average Cash Split in % Count 50 92 1181 100 91 354 200 90 304 500 90 296 1,000 88 123 2,000 91 64 5,000 93 56 10,000 79 17 15,000 57 2 The second chart, below, is a boxplot of the cash share of the acquisition. The red box represents the 25 to 75% quartiles and each black point is an outlier (greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean). In the dot-com boom, when stock was cheap and plentiful, many acquisitions had considerable stock components. Over time, however, as the technology companies’ balance sheets have become cash rich, the trend has progressed from 77% cash to 94% cash in 13 years. Perhaps as SaaS valuations continue their stratospheric rise and stock becomes cheap, incumbents acquihire startups or bolster their product offerings with add-on acquisitions, the stock/cash split may revert more to the mean. But today, cash is king.

Bitcoin has captivated the imaginations of many with its quasi-anonymous, hyper cost-efficient payment network. The potential for Bitcoin to change foreign exchange is hard to overstate. In the same vein, the technologies that enable the internet of things (IoT) like Bluetooth Low Energy and Apple’s Beacons and Electric Imp’s infrastructure will transform the way we interact with the physical world to something akin to the mall in Minority Report. The startups that bring Bitcoin and IoT to the mass-market won’t declare themselves Bitcoin companies or connected devices companies. I’ve never seen a computer marketed as a TCP/IP machine or a bank that promotes the ACH compatibility of its checking accounts or a social network trumpet its H.264 codec support. I doubt I ever will because supporting a protocol isn’t a value proposition that attracts end users. Instead, these disruptive startups will market a product, which although enabled by Bitcoin and IoT technologies, wrap and hide the underlying protocol in a product that is significantly better than the competition. I suspect the first mass-market successful Bitcoin company won’t have Bitcoin (or any subset of the word) in its name. This startup will market itself just the same as a competing financial services company, but offer significantly lower fees for remittances or foreign exchange. Similarly, on its website, Nest, maker of connected thermostats and smoke detectors, never mentions never mentions the words Internet of Things . Even the word Wifi is only found on its customer support pages . Most of the time, protocol support is table stakes. Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook and others all speak the same language, IMAP, so users can send emails back and forth. Other times, new protocols, like the ones underpinning Bitcoin and IoT, enable disruptive products that solve customer needs in novel ways. In these cases, it’s not the particular protocol that matters but the benefit to the end user. Thanks to Nick Shalek, who inspired this post.

I was lucky enough to spend some time with Monica Adractas, a former McKinsey partner who is now Churn Czar at Box. She and I chatted about the challenges in managing churn and her view on how to handle it. I thought she had some terrific insights and a clear understanding of the methods to reduce churn from her experiences. These are my notes from that conversation: Managing churn is a complicated problem because everyone in the company can impact it. The product and engineering teams must build a product that meets customer needs. Sales must find and close the right kinds of customers. Support must educate, inform and cross-sell customers properly, and marketing must price and message the product effectively. If any one of these teams makes a misstep, churn rises. To materially reduce churn, the company must appoint someone who has the data access and the mandate within the organization to search for and identify causes of churn and the influence to enact change. This person is often the first cross-functional hire for a startup, the first person whose job is exclusively to work with all the different teams. Often this person is called the head of customer success. Initially, the head of customer success is charged with churn mitigation, i.e. retaining customers for longer periods of time. But over time, the customer success role evolves to maximizing lifetime-value of a customer. The difference between the two is the addition of cross-sell/up-sell, selling more of the same product or selling adjacent products to increase the revenue per customer. This transition is of course contingent upon the company building additional products and features that can command additional revenue in the market. The key initial steps for the head of customer success are: First, to instrument the company to understand customer pathways, points of interaction and the customer perception of the company’s value proposition. Second, to analyze and develop a system-level understanding of the state of churn. Third, champion and effect change in each of the relevant functional groups to reduce churn. By having one person own the churn number figure and prosecute the tactics to reduce it, the head of customer success can materially change the financial profile of the company. – Monica’s view of her role at Box provided me with a really clear understanding of how the head of customer success ought to pursue their role and also the right background for a person to succeed in this role: empathy for customers, data-driven decision making, systems thinking and an ability to coordinate many different decision makers in an organization.

Sam Altman argues in How to Grow Huge that the only way for a startup to grow really large is to create products that people love and promote. As the user base grows, users attract ever larger numbers of users to the product, producing compounding growth. The point is a terrific one and I think it can be generalized. To grow really large, startups have to create proprietary distribution channels. The one Sam champions, word of mouth marketing intrinsic to a strong brand, is one example of a proprietary distribution channel. Other examples include Dropbox’s referral mechanism , Hubspot’s blog (the 490th most-trafficked site in the US), GitHub and Cyanogen Mod ’s community and GroupOn’s email list of 150M+ addresses. In each of these cases, the startup owns the distribution channel. Sometimes the channel is integrated in the product (Dropbox), sometimes the channel is adjacent (HubSpot, Cyanogen). In either case, no competitor can touch it. Challengers may try to replicate the success of the distribution channel by copying it, but cannot compete within the channel, which means it’s an incredibly cost-effective channel for its owner. Contrast these proprietary distribution channels with hyper-efficient and competitive online ad markets both SEM and display, SEO rankings, and  open platforms like the iOS and Android and Salesforce and Intuit and other online app stores. These are open markets with lots of competition which enforce efficient pricing and reduce margins. It’s a boxing match with every entrant taking their fair share of punches. Sometimes startups begin in the open market, and having achieved some scale, foster their own channels. Zynga and Kabam grew to some scale on Facebook’s traffic hose before both deciding to move to their own platforms. AirBnB drafted on Craigslist’s listing velocity to engender enough liquidity of their own. YouTube and MySpace is the same story . Ultimately, each of these success stories built their own user acquisition channels. Sam is absolutely right. The only way to grow really large is to build and control proprietary distribution channels. It’s a huge strategic imperative for startups reaching scale.

A key component in a startup’s formula for success is educating customers about the product and driving sales. The sales and marketing teams of a startup are responsible for this. There are many ways to structure sales and marketing teams. The diagram above outlines a sales and marketing team structure that I’ve observed across many startups. It is consistent with the organizational design Salesforce used to drive revenue from $0 to $100M, described Aaron Ross’s book, Predictable Revenue . Jon Miller, CMO of Marketo, has also written an important blog post on the subject, The Definitive Guide to Sales Development . The chart above shows three roles: Marketing, SDR/ADR (Sales Development Rep/Account Development Rep), AE (Account Executive). Marketing teams generate Marketing Qualified Leads through content marketing and lifecycle marketing. Inbound ADR/SDRs evaluate inbound leads (from marketing and product and customer upsells). Outbound ADR/SDRs gin up their own leads through cold calling and qualify them. The typical SDR should be able to qualify on the order of 60 to 100 leads per day and generate 250 to 400 high-quality leads per month, depending on the number of calls required to qualify a customer, which is contigent on product complexity. These three roles (marketing, inbound & outbound SDRs) comprise the marketing function, which is contained in the blue rectangle in this diagram. Both Marketing and SDRs should be measured on leads generated. SDRs generally earn $50-70k depending on performance. Because each of their performance metrics are leads, it’s logical to place SDRs within the marketing organization, but some companies embed SDRs in Sales to align the lead quality incentives. The Account Executives, in the red Sales rectangle, receive qualified leads from SDRs and should aim to close a high fraction of them. In Jon Miller’s posts, he reports a 7% qualified lead rate by SDRs and an 80% AE close rate. These figures can vary due to many factors: the workload of AEs, the product maturity, the SDR productivity, product/market fit and so on. The more important figure of the wo is the AE close rate. AEs must receive highly qualified prospectt consistently so trust can be built between the AEs and SDRs. The Account Executives are measured on a new bookings figure and given a quota . There are many ways of structuring sales and marketing teams. Different markets, market segments and products will demand new and novel ways of pursuing the market, but this framework can serve as a roadmap and guide to the basic structure, integration points, and key metrics for each team. Third in a Series on Startup Managment. The first post is Situational Management . The second post is Startup Team Sizes .

For retailers of any size from startup to Fortune 50, the tablet application has become more important than the mobile application. IBM’s annual Black Friday ecommerce report , which tracks 800 internet retailers proves the point. Tablet users buy at a conversion rate which is 300% greater than mobile phones and despite generating only 60% of smart phone traffic, drive 65% more transactions at 14% larger basket sizes. Ultimately, the average tablet user is worth 3.5x the average mobile phone user. This is true even though the download ranks of the top 4 retail applications in the iTunes store are nearly identical. App iPhone iPad Difference Amazon 17 22 5 eBay 40 30 -10 GroupOn 44 54 10 Target 72 100 28 The impact of tablets will only increase. Tablet penetration in the US at 35% is roughly half that of smart phone penetration . But all the leading indicators show explosive growth in that figure. 67% of teens own both a phone and a tablet . Walmart sold 1.4M tablets on Thanksgiving Day alone , increasing household tablet penetration by 1.4% in just one day. As Flurry’s data proves , there is an explosion in the number of new mobile applications but more importantly 300%+ annual growth in the number of apps commanding audiences of 20M or more MAU. I don’t think any of these have been tablet first, but very soon and particularly in retail, I think we will see tablet-first/primarily tablet apps reach tremendous scale. The unit economics are just that compelling.

I first learned about Sankey diagrams in my thermodynamics class and they’ve since become one of my favorite data visualizations and analysis tools. Sankey diagrams, like the one above of visitors to this blog, show the flow of things. Originally created for measuring the flow of energy through powerplants, they are incredibly useful for content marketing analysis, visitor analysis or any other kind of funnel analysis. The best Sankey diagram ever created is Charles Joseph Minard ’s depiction of the Napoleonic War, which was made famous in Edward Tufte’s Book, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information . It’s amazing because there are at least five different dimensions of data displayed in an intelligible way. Try that with any other chart. I use Sankey diagrams to understand how people navigate through this blog. At the bottom of this page, I’ve created a Read This Next box. Google Analytics’ Sankey diagram showing user behavior is the most intuitive way I’ve found of understanding and measuring the impact of that feature. To see your GA Sankey diagram, click the Behavior tab, then the Behavior Flow tab from the Google Analytics home screen. You’ll see a chart like the one above. When I log in, I look first at the 1st interaction to see the breakdown of how people arrive at my blog. Next, I want to understand how they navigate the site. By looking at the patterns for each subsquent interaction, I can get a sense and by tallying the page views in each of the first eight interactions, I know that the Read This Next Feature increases page views by 10% in total. More importantly, for engaged users (those who click on at least one more page), Read This Next doubles page views. Last, the Read This Next Feature drives 10.5x the number of page views as the previous/next buttons on the index page and 128% more traffic than the home page link at the top of the page. Sankey diagrams can be applied in sales conversion funnels to understand how efficient teams are in closing customers and where in the process the most effective improvements can be made. They can be used to understand customer lifetimes, upgrade cycles. Properly applied, Sankey diagrams provide deep insight into longitidinual patterns. Give them a try the next time you’re tempted to employ a funnel. The two best ways I’ve found of creating Sankey diagrams are D3’s Sankey toolkit by Michael Bostock (which can also be done in Excel ) and RCharts in R ; but there are many ways .

The typical mobile phone’s home screen is occupied by more than 30 applications . A digital tragedy of the commons, each additional mobile application a user downloads decreases the odds of an average application re-engaging a user. After all, the time spent on mobile isn’t increasing fast enough to cover the marginal application. Developers have used push notifications effectively to re-engage users , but push overload drives more and more users to opt out of push . Because of this app over-population and the tremendous reach many mobile developers have , mobile advertising spend will shift from new customer acquisition to re-engagement. The mobile cost-per-install market is measured in the billions . But the mobile re-engagement market will be measured in the tens of billions. After all, most of the internet ad spend is on re-engagment. The largest internet ad spend categories, retail, financial, telecom, auto and travel all spend extensively on re-engagement. The growth of Criteo, a retargeting company, is just a small indicator of the size of the re-engagement ad market. Search Google for a flight from San Francisco to Las Vegas and you’ll see a re-engagement ad . This shift hasn’t gone unnoticed. Facebook launched Reengagement Ads . Google is also forging ahead with deep linking for mobile app re-engagement. Startups will of course forge innovative paths to market and unlock new opportunities. Ultimately, the mobile app ecosystem will experience the same tectonic shift from a directory of applications both in the App Store and on the device to intent driven discovery - a parallel shift from Yahoo’s directory to Google’s search, search ads and content ads on the web. Fortunes will be made in the process.

At its core, a startup’s advantage in the market is the speed created by focus. When a team is well orchestrated, they can accomplish amazing things. Creating an environment that fosters communication best is therefore an essential part of startup management. But how best to do it? Founders have to balance span-of-control with span-of-managerial-responsibility. In an article this week’s New Yorker , Amazon’s founder/CEO Jeff Bezos is quoted on the subject with a contrarian point of view: Communication is a sign of dysfunction. It means people aren’t working together in a close, organic way. We should be trying to figure out a way for teams to communicate less with each other, not more… Bezos reduces communication with the two pizza box team . He reasons, if you can’t feed a team with two pizzas, it’s too large. Metcalfe’s Law shows that the number of relationships within a team increases geometrically as the team grows. Most agree that smaller teams reduce communication overhead, improve focuse and produce more. But how should a startup manage lots of small teams? How many reports to a manager and how many managers? At Google, I measured the product manager to engineer ratios across different projects in the company. More generally, this metric is called the span of control .  On average, the ratio was 1:7. But we observed enormous variance. Search engineering saw ratios of 1:20 or higher. Newer consumer products might have 2 to 4 engineers per PM. Why such variance? The best reasoning I’ve found is Peter Drucker’s. Drucker created a complementary concept called span of managerial responsibility which he defined as: “the extent to which teaching and assistance are needed.” In other words, very senior engineering teams, like the ones on Google Search Quality, don’t need much teaching and assistance most often because they have extensive experience. These team can thrive at spans of control of 15+. More junior teams, teams new to a field or teams building a new kind of product will demand greater managerial responsibility, which means smaller teams. Some startups pursue flat organizations without managers or with rotating managers. 37Signals and Valve employ very flat management structures which enable employees to self-organize. These novel management styles can be effective, but only when the span of managerial responsibility doesn’t demand lots of assistance. There is no universal optimal team size, according to research . But the best team size for a startup is the one that balances span-of-control and span-of-managerial-responsibility. And if that’s too hard to figure out, 7 is a good first stab. Second in a Series on Startup Management. The first post is Situational Management.

When I first started programming at a startup, I were proud even snobbish about the language we used: Java. I derided JavaScript. I couldn’t have been more wrong. JavaScript has become the dominant language of the web. Every browser, PC and mobile, understands Javascript. It is a lingua franca among computers. Some hardware even speaks JavaScript. Because of its universality, JavaScript’s growth has compounded. The chart above shows the number of code repositories by language on GitHub, as analyzed by RedMonk . JavaScript’s share has tripled in 5 years and the number of job requisitions seeking Javascript has grown in parallel. As JavaScript’s popularity has ballooned, the technology has matured. Google has accelerated JavaScript performance by 7x in just four years by boosting JavaScript’s virtual machine , called V8, to the benefit of 750 million Chrome users . JavaScript, long known to be notoriously slow, is now faster than Ruby . Additionally, new JavaScript frameworks have blossomed enabling the millions of web developers to build full and rich applications quickly. Node.js , Angular.js and Meteor enable easy access to databases, simpler code maintenance and Model-View-Controller architecture , analogous to Spring for Java and Rails for Ruby. JavaScript may not have all the attributes to appeal to every developer. Some may not like its syntax or its speed or its lack of inheritance . But for all of its faults, JavaScript has been cemented as the universal programming language of the web. With behemoths like Google, startups like Meteor and a litany of open source contributors constantly improving the language and the frameworks to build applications, JavaScript will be the platform for web innovation for a long time to come. Thanks to Geoff Schmidt of Meteor, who shared a conversation with me that inspired this post.

How much cash does a tech venture-backed company burn through before IPO? The median 2013 VC-backed tech IPO burned $33M and the average company burned $76M. The chart above shows the net income/burn rate of 2013 tech IPO by years since founding. Four categories of companies jump out in the chart: the profit leaders, the middle-of-the-pack, the negative hockey stick, and the go-for-broke. The profit leaders, Veeva(VEEV) and RetailMeNot(SALE), have generated tremendous profits from the outset. The middle-of-the-pack companies, including Rally(RALY) and Tableau(DATA), burn no more than $25M annually. Some like Chegg(CHGG), RingCentral(RNG), Marketo(MKTO) and FireEye(FEYE) show reverse hockey-sticks - their burn is increasing at an increasing rate. And the go-for-broke contingent of WorkDay(WDAY), Twitter(TWTR), Gogo(GOGO), Violin(VMEM) and SilverSpring(SSNI) have exceeded the $100M burned in one year mark. In addition to the capital invested to become public, a startup must have cash on its balance sheet at IPO. The median company carried $32M and the average company carried $43M on its balance sheet before IPO. In total, the median startup raised $65M and the average startup raised $119M before IPO.  Practically speaking, this likely means four rounds of financing for the IPO-bound startup: something like $5M Series A, $10M Series B, $25M Series C, $25M Series D in the median case. How much runway did the 2013 IPOs possess along the way? On average, these now-public names kept 1.1 years of runway in the bank. The chart above shows the smoothed trend across the 2013 IPO vintage. In the early days, the numbers are skewed by Zulily, the only company in the list to IPO 4 years after founding. Years 4 onward are much more representative, when the average company held about 9 to 15 months of cash. At the bottom of the post, I’ve included the box plot which shows these trends in more detail. The typical 2013 VC backed tech IPO took seven years to become a publicly traded company. In the years immediately preceding their IPO, these companies increased their burn rates substantially from $5 to $10M in the first 3-4 years, then to about $25M in the 5th year and $40M in the 6th, before declining steadily after IPO. Below, I’ve included the box plots that provide more detail about each of these analysis and the histogram of time to IPO.

If you’re building a startup, content marketing is a powerful tool to build a brand, develop customer relationships, and develop a a hiring pipeline. Blogging requires diligence and a few tricks to build a following. I’ve been writing for about 3 years and I’ve analyzed a few hundred of my posts to better understand what makes for effective content marketing. These are my lessons learned: I have 48 seconds to get my message across in this post. No pretty images, no increase or decrease in word count, no amount of retweets or favorites will convince the reader to linger. Giving any indication to the reader that they are about to read a long post is death. Paragraph headings are the best indication of that a post will be long and these posts have 20% higher bounce rates, when a user immediately hits the back button after landing on page. The reader doesn’t care about images. Images don’t impact any metric I tracked: page views, time on site, retweets, favorites, or bounce rate. Images may attract users to click when they are browsing, but anyone who lands directly on a blog post is ambivalent about them. If the reader likes what they read, they will poke around the site some more. The relationship between time on page and time on site is very strong. Writing good content matters and surfacing related material pays off. Social proof works and its huge. Social drives about 45% of visitors to the blog. Importantly, there is no degradation in traffic quality from social networks. Visitors who arrive at the blog through retweets spend the same amount of time and have similar bounce rates to other visitors. In short, when you start your content marketing strategy, be brief, get to the point and write great stuff. The rest will take care of itself.

In response to yesterday’s post on management design patterns, many readers asked for examples of best practices. So I’m going to write about the management best practices I have been taught and I have observed in startups. This is the first post of that series. The first management technique is called Situational Management , one that my wife, a terrific manager at Google, taught me. A manager’s most important function in a startup is to motivate employees to accomplish the business’s goal. Each employee’s motivation to work will vary with time, which means a manager’s style and goals should respond to those changes. The same management style doesn’t work across all employees, nor can one management style be applied to an employee over their career. In other words, effective management depends on the situation. At the highest level, there are four basic situations: The image above is a 2x2 matrix with employee skill (defined as the ability to complete the job asked of them) on the x-axis and employee motivation on the y-axis. Each quadrant contains one situation: Low motivation, low skill: this one is pretty easy. The person hasn’t been placed in the right role or hasn’t been able to understand how to be effective within the company. It’s time for the company and employee to part ways. High motivation, low skill: the most typical state for an employee to be in after he has been hired or promoted. He is excited and energetic but unfamiliar with the particulars of the job, or the company, or the culture. Somewhat counterintuitively, the best management technique in this situation is micromanagement. Despite its reputation, micromanagement is a powerful management tool in this situation. The manager must convert the employee’s motivation into skill so the employee will become effective and feel valued. The best way to do this is by frequent check-ins, updates, and feedback. Applied this way, micromanagement provides the employee very fast and very short learning cycles. Each day, the employee receives a mini-review of his work. Within a few weeks, the employee have learnt quite a bit and become productive. Low motivation, high skill: aka burnout. Employees reach this stage after working  hard for an extended period of time. The biggest risk for managers with employees in this quadrant is losing them to another employer because of frustration or disillusionment. A manager ought to put this employee “out to pasture” for a week or a few weeks, meaning allowing her to work on self-directed projects or projects of passion to recharge her motivation. High motivation, high skill: this quadrant contains high-performing employees, the ideal state. The best management advice is to get out of the way. Situational management is a simplifying framework to help managers identify the state of each employee and provide the right support to help them fulfill their potential.

Earlier this week, I chatted with a friend of mine who has founded an incredibly successful business, which he and his co-founder have been scaling impressively. I asked him about his biggest learning over the past few years. He said before having started his company and having built the team, he perceived management as a Band-Aid, as a fix for something wrong in the organizational design, communication or day-to-day operations of the company. Over time, he has come to believe that manangement is the only way of growing his startup. But it’s what he said next that really resonated with me. “Management has Design Patterns.” In engineering, there are an infinite number of ways of solving a problem. Some are quite clearly better than others. The best ways are codified into Design Patterns. Engineers employ design patterns to accelerate development by leveraging the work and insight of others. In addition, design patterns improve team communication because the codebase adheres to standard way of doing things, making the code is easy to understand. For these reasons, most engineers study design patterns both in college and independently. Many keep a copy on their desks for reference. Just like engineers, managers have created a set of design patterns which are called best practices. When managing a team, there are an infinite number of ways to guide and influence, motivate and reward that team. But some ways are clearly better than others. For those who come from engineering backgrounds, it’s rare for us to have learned about these management best practices. I first began to hear about them at Google when I was an Associate PM. Each APM spoke with a management coach twice a week and I was fortunate to have a seasoned and effective coach. She gave me frameworks for delivering difficult feedback, structuring groups, motivating teams, and obtaining team committment to drive success. Just having a mental model for how to speak with team members gave me confidence. I wasn’t a very good manager, but the best practices help me become a little bit better. The most effective engineering teams leverage all the learning and tools available to them to build high quality software efficiently. Similarly, the most successful startups use both engineering design patterns and management best practices to build high quality, well-functioning teams to grow the business.

At the bottom of this blog, there’s an inocuous sharing bar with links to share this post on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, HackerNews and subscribe by email and RSS. 1.5% of visitors click on one of these buttons. Despite the similarity of the buttons and the clicks, the value they generate as sharing tools varies dramatically. The chart above shows data from the widget on this blog for the past 30 days, comparing the number of clicks on each button and the traffic that results from that channel. Three traffic generation behaviors emerge from this chart which I call the charts (HackerNews), the networks (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) and the 1-to-1s (Email, RSS). Not many people submit posts to HackerNews, but those clicks generate 3x their share of traffic. Social networks generate roughly the same share of clicks and traffic. 1-to-1 marketing channels, particularly email, generate more than their share of clicks, but very little traffic by comparison. In other words, it’s a natural funnel. Given these patterns, I’ve developed a mental model for maximizing the value of each channel which is shown below. The goal of this model is to capture as much traffic from the charts and convert those readers into long-term relationships as efficiently as possible. On the left is a chart with reach, the number of users a content marketing channel commands on the y-axis and on the x-axis, the frequency I can engage with those readers. On the right side of the chart, I’ve listed the goals of each content marketing channel.  Let’s walk through it in more detail. Charts : Charts concentrate distribution. Like the Billboard 100 or iTunes Top 25 top grossing, content marketing “charts” collect millions of users each day and generate huge/interest traffic spikes in the feature stories and products. Charts are editorially curated, either by a small group in the case of publications (TechCrunch, GigaOm, WSJ, NYTimes) or a very large group (HackerNews, Reddit). Individuals with great influence over social networks and who perform a content curation function, people like Hiten Shah or Joel Gascoigne , are also “charts.” It’s hard to break into the charts, because everyone with a story wants to be on that list and for good reason. Charts are powerful reader acquisition tools because they provide access to a huge breadth of readers. To maximize the value of the charts, the traffic they generate must be bottled in some way. Social networks provide that bottling mechanism. Social networks amplify content within smaller networks. Likes, RTs and +1s confer social proof , which is one of the most powerful influences on people. That social proof drives new potential readers to become followers of this blog on a social network. 1 to 1 provide a persistent content marketing relationship and immediate addressablity. I can email readers and they can email me. The ultimate goal of every content marketing campaign is to send the right message to  the right people at the right time. To do that, I believe in first reaching lots of people, then using the social proof instrinsic to social networks to influence and encourage readers to build a long term relationship. Those grandiose goals all start with a simple little sharing widget. Notes about the Analysis The event data is gathered using Google Analytics custom tracking feature. A Javascript event is fired each time a user clicks on the share widget. The traffic data also comes from Google analytics referral headers. I do not acccount for dark social traffic, because I can’t tell the origin of that traffic, so the social network referral figures may be depressed by an indeterminate amount. I assume the majority of sharing actions begin on this blog and not from other sources.

Steven Blank wrote yesterday about a novel way of depicting a startup’s competitive landscape in a pitch deck, called a petal diagram. While the petal diagram is a great way of describing an ecosystem or a go-to-market strategy, I don’t think it’s a great way to show a competitive landscape because petal diagrams don’t communicate the startup’s unique way of competing in the market. The ideal competition slide accomplishes at least one but up to four goals. First, the competition slide communicates the startup’s worldview of their ecosystem, relays the key axes of differentiation in the market and summarizes the startup’s advantages. Second, the competition slide demarcates the other key players in the ecosystem, established and emerging, and how each of them fit within the worldview. Third, the slide conveys the dynamics within the ecosystem: who is partnered with whom; which incumbents are looking to partner/acquire vs go it alone, etc. Fourth, the competition slide should shows the current market opportunity and if needed adjacent market opportunities that justify a venture scale outcome . The petal diagram can effectively communicate the players in the ecosystem and describe how a startup will engage with an ecosystem through customer acquisition channels. In the fictitious Rocket Startup example above, the petal diagram shows all the different customers segments the Rocket might pursue, which could be filled with customers logos, and the sales mechanisms the company might use to acquire those customers. But a petal diagram is a very difficult format to convey Rocket’s differentiation in the market required to win share. I’m not sure how to do it. Tweet me if you have ideas. Even for a company in a new segment, like internet of things or drones, it’s unclear how to express differentiation with the petal diagram. There’s a reason the 2x2 matrix is cliche - it works for well understood industries where the size and segments of the market are understood and the typical disruptive innovation is a price/performance breakthrough, like this one for Pure Storage. Another alternative is a pyramid which expresses a startups intent to disrupt a market by addressing a new segment, as in this example for Expensify. Value chains can also be used to express disruption by vertical integration or disintermediation. In this case, the diagram highlights Electric Imp’s vertical integration in the connected devices world. There are many ways to create a competition slide. No matter the format, the structure of the slide has to reinforce and support the main message, which in the case of competition slides, is why the startup is best positioned to win disproportionate share. The petal diagram is a useful tool for depicting go-to-market and ecosystem slides where channels and partners are important, but because of the difficulty in expressing differentiation, I wonder about its effectiveness as a competitive overview format.

Constrained by a limited budget while seeking to grow as quickly as possible, startup founders must decide how to balance growing their engineering teams with their sales & marketing teams. To help inform those decisions, I’ve benchmarked the relative sizes of the sales and engineering teams of the 36 publicly-traded SaaS companies from founding to IPO, typically 7 years later. The graph above shows the average Sales & Marketing allocation in turquoise and  Research & Development investment in red. In the early years of these startups, sales and marketing salaries consumed about 90% of revenues and slowly fell to 45%. Engineering commanded 50% of revenue, which also declined over time as revenue increased and more of that revenue was harvested as profit or re-invested elsewhere in the business. The average founding team tends to be 2 people , one of whom is an engineer. When a company is founded, the sales/marketing to engineer ratio is 1:1. After the first year, this ratio for the public SaaS companies increases to 2:1 (S&M:R&D) for the life of the company. Year Since Founding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Median Revenue in $M 2.6 3.5 11.3 25.2 55.2 69.6 98.1 Sales : Eng Ratio 1.5 3.5 2.0 1.7 1.9 2.4 2.1 Sample Size 1 1 5 9 12 16 18 This table above shows the data in a bit more detail including the sample size for each year. Only LogMeIn provided data in their S-1 about the first two years after founding, so the quality of the data there is questionable, but not wildly inaccurate from my experience. For those seeking even more detail, box plots below show the distribution for Sales & Marketing and Research & Development. They tell a similar story, but expose the variance across companies. Notes about the Analysis First, these ratios aren’t a recipe for success, just data to inform decisions. Each business is different because of the industry they serve, the go-to-market strategy and the particularities of their customers acquisition processes. Second, the sales and marketing spend used in these calculations is the one provided by these companies in their S-1s and 10-ks, which includes all media purchasing, event budgets and other marketing spend. None of these startups break out marketing spend in their financial statements. But typically, somewhere around 15% of total revenue is spent on marketing and PR and my rough estimate of media spend is 7% of total revenue, which would decrease the S&M/R&D ratios by about 15% from those listed above. Third, these companies lump all engineering spend together, so the same is true for research and development. I’m assuming all R&D for these businesses is product development, even if a SaaS company management team decides it is prudent to develop a drone program or another project othogonal to the current business.

In almost every industry, startups and venture capital included, content marketing has become an essential tool for growth. Over the past four years, I’ve developed infrastructure, analyses and processes to help this blog grow from just a few visitors per month to nearly a hundred thousand today, achieved a Twitter follower quarterly growth rate of 20% and built a mailing list of close to one thousand readers. In this post, I’ve detailed are the strategies, software and techniques I use. This is the architecture diagram for the blog. After developing this infrastructure, the three most important conclusions I’ve reached about content marketing initiatives are: Content marketing must be tied to path-of-business systems and processes; Daily experimentation and measurement are the best ways to systematically improve performance; Content syndicated as part of the effort must be high quality, genuine and relevant to the target audience. At the outset, I measured the blog’s sucess with metrics like traffic growth and increased follower counts. But I’ve come to believe that to be successful, content marketing must further a business goal like increasing marketing qualified leads, brand building, or recruiting. Therefore, content marketing infrastructure can’t simply be a blogging platform and a Twitter client. The content marketing systems must tie into customer relationship systems (Salesforce), applicant tracking systems (Jobvite), customer support systems (Zendesk) or the like. My goal for the blog is to first contribute to the startup community with content, then reach all the relevant entrepreneurs I can and ultimately build lasting relationships with entrepreneurs. I believe that great entrepreneurs can come from anywhere . This blog helps me find them. This is my process: Every working day, I write a post. First, I syndicate that post to the places entrepreneurs congregate online. Today, those places are HackerNews, Quibb, LinkedIn and Twitter. These social channels and dark social visits generate more than 50% of the traffic to the blog. Direct navigation contributes 30%, and email plus RSS account for the remainder. Second, I try to respond to readers’ comments and suggestions. Inbound volumes vary by day, sometimes it’s just a tweet or two. Other times, I receive fifty tweets and emails. Many of these responses happen offline. The blog’s content breaks the ice during meetings and starts conversations at meetups and conferences. These interactions, both digital and physical, help me build audiences on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Quibb. But building an audience and increasing follower metrics aren’t the end goal. I want to find and meet entrepreneurs among those audiences and build relationships with them. To solve that problem, I built a tool in Rails called Scour. Scour aggregates publicly available data, applies some basic filters and scours each week’s new followers to surface entrepreneurs and other people in the startup ecosystem. Each week, Scour combines those people into a business development list that I use to grow my network. I contact each person on the Scour list to chat or meet. After the meeting, I add a few notes about each person into a CRM for people called Contactually. These details might include a funny story, shared interests, mutual friends, and personal goals. If the person I’ve met is an entrepreneur, I catalog the salient details of their business in Salesforce. Third, I try to deepen and extend my relationship with people in my network and with readers by offering email subscription and RSS subscription on the blog, by creating periodic follow ups in Salesforce and Contactually to schedule meetings, and by nurturing those relationships as best I can. Last, I analyze each step of the process to determine how well the four initiatives are performing. Each day, I consult my SumAll dashboard for site traffic, email deliverablity, email list growth, Twitter follower growth and engagement rates. Each week, I’ll review changes in Twitter audience using FollowerWonk and Wildfire’s Monitor tool to benchmark growth. In addition, I’ve instrumented the blog with custom Google Analytics triggers to track social sharing, subscribes and internal site navigation which are analyzed each week. That data informs changes to the layout and style of the blog. Each weekend, I analyze one key component of the blog’s performance. Last week, I researched the impact of headers and images on engagement and bounce rates . Other areas I explore include site performance, SEO, content keyword analysis, twitter recirculation analysis , social sharing time of day analysis , twitter ads analysis and many others. I code each of these projects in Ruby and R and then add them to a periodic analysis to ensure none of the conclusions change with time. Ultimately, content marketing, like performance marketing and brand building have to contribute to the business in a quantifiable way. By coupling content marketing to a path-of-business system and instrumenting every step of the way, it’s possible to create a performant engine for growth.

Twitter is the first form of communication that changes depending on who is using it. Like the telephone, the fax, email, Twitter enables all types of communications: friendly banter, customer support requests, news syndication and public service announcements to name a few. But Twitter imposes a three new wrinkles that set it apart as a new form of communication. First, the recipients of a tweet are knowable but never really known. One could sift through a list of Twitter followers but never understand who they are, if they pay attention to tweets, why they follow an account, or what agenda they have.  Followers might include close friends, business acquaintances, customers, strangers and Justin Bieber - or any combination. Second, a user’s experience with Twitter changes based upon their following. Sending a tweet falls somewhere along the continuum of yelling into the woods when no one else is around, practicing Shakespeare in a crowded public park or stumping on stage in front of 100,000 people in the audience with a microphone in hand. A Twitter user’s follower count molds his Twitter experience. Third, Twitter is the only communication form that doesn’t require systematic processing of messages. Most of us respond to email, SMS, voice mail and phone calls with dogmatic diligence. In the Twitter stream, users are panning for gold, balancing signal and noise in a much more equal quantities than voicemail. Missing a few thousand tweets doesn’t really matter. These three properties of Twitter enable users to bend and shape their experiences as they wish. It’s this plasticity that makes Twitter such a novel communication platform. We each have to learn how to use it, as we use it.

I’ve always wanted to read a newspaper like The Daily Prophet from Harry Potter, a daily with animated images and with articles that respond to the reader. Last week, the Guardian, the world’s third-most widely read paper, published NSA Files: Decoded which explores the many different points of view on the NSA’s information collection efforts. As you scroll down, senators and attorneys and experts begin briefing you. Interactive data charts invite you to explore trends and embedded documents beg you to dig deeper. This is how a newspaper ought to be. This feature article represents the future of journalism and the written word, particularly in an era of touch-enabled devices. Today, crafting features like NSA:Decoded is a huge task and completely unscalable. The writers and editors and engineers at the Guardian likely invested tens if not hundreds of hours to assemble it. The content creation tools and workflows prevent widescale content production of this quality. I hope video creation and editing tools, content management tools, and the data visualization tools will evolve to such an extent that articles like NSA: Decoded are the norm. I see signs that this is starting to happen but it’s early yet. YouTube’s video creator ecosystem is pushing the boundaries of scalable video creation. Next generation enterprise content management systems must evolve, though I don’t know many new entrants in that sector. And the data visualization capabilities of D3, Google Fusion Tables, and Vega, among many others , need to be simplified and integrated into content creation workflows. I hope the team at the Guardian writes about the process they used to create their investigative journalism epic and that entrepreneurs take up the challenge to create the software to enable these rich, magical experiences to be published daily.

In 2013, growth trumps all other considerations. For the average 2013 venture backed tech IPO, half of the startup’s enterprise value is explained by its growth rate, while none of it is explained by profitability. The market has spoken and startups have responded. Of the 25 IPOs I surveyed, both pending and completed, only 20% are profitable. On average, these startups operate at about -20% net income margins but are growing at 162% annually. The startup financing market is (mostly) a trickle down market. The public markets benchmark the value of different companies, growth trajectories and financial characteristics daily. These data are used to price comparable companies in the private markets particularly by growth investors but increasingly by earlier investors. SaaS startups prove the point. Their older brothers have become darlings in the public markets, and as a result, early stage SaaS valuations have appreciated quite rapidly in the venture and growth stage markets. The opposite is true for gaming startups, caused by Zynga’s tumultuous ride on the Nasdaq. Let’s go to the data to prove the point. Below is a chart with 21 different 2013 IPOs. The y-axis shows 2012 revenue growth and the x-axis shows the enterprise value of the business (log10). Each company is represented by a dot and the ticker is labeled. It’s easy to draw a straight line up and to the right. The correlation between these two is 0.51, quite strong. This means growth is the single most important correlating factor when predicting enterprise value. Next, is the same chart for net income and enterprise value. It’s a mess compared to the one above. There is no relationship between profitability and the startup’s enterprise value. The correlation between net income and enterprise value is zero. Notice Control4 and Violin memory have the same market cap, but one is break-even and the other lost $120M on revenues of $90M. That means the company’s gross burn is $210M annually! I suspect tech IPOs are one of the very few high growth investments afforded to investors. Because there aren’t many alternatives for these investment dollars that can generate meaningful returns, startups who are going public command pricing premiums even without the discipline of profitable growth. Today, that trend is trickling down to the early stage venture market and reinforced what has always been true in early stage startup investing: growth is king.

In 2008, iGoogle represented 20% of traffic to Google. Seven years later, the mobile phone is the home screen of choice for a billion people. iGoogle is dead. Mobile killed it. The typical mobile phone user checks their phone 110 times per day .  I suspect iGoogle’s most avid users visited about 10 times daily. By that math, mobile home screens generate an order of magnitude more engagement. If Google or any company wants to provide the home screen to those billion people, that home screen must be a mobile app. Mobile’s frequency of use is the reason for its disruptive nature.  iGoogle’s successor will be the product that leverages the frequency afforded by mobile devices and provides access to all the critical information surfaced by apps through Android notifications to win share of habit . Whenever I check my phone during the day, I step through the essential apps:  SMS & messaging, email, calendar, social (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr etc), news, blog stats, stocks, commute time, package shipping data and so on. I imagine many people have a similar routine. Google Now provides half of this; Android notifications provides the other half. More than just providing iGoogle’s list of links or text snippets, Android’s rich notifications and Google’s newly announced app-deep linking should enable users to act upon information, sending emails, opening news articles in Flipboard and responding to @messages in app. Google Now’s intelligent prioritization would show me the most important things first, based upon my previous search actions, email history and stock searches. Last, the app would be available as the mobile home screen and also as a lockscreen widget. By combining notifications with the intelligence behind Google Now, this new product would unify all the important data I want on one screen. This idealized product would become my mobile home screen and I suspect a homescreen for hundreds of millions of users. Whether or not Google or another company builds this successor to iGoogle doesn’t matter. The broader trend is the important one. The products that once dominated the web no longer fit the mobile users’ needs and present a huge opportunity for new products and companies to seize.

Quietly mentioned in yesterday’s press conference about Google’s Android update is a new feature that will change the way people use their mobile phones, search deep-linking. With KitKat, Google is applying its world-class crawling and search technology to the content and data within mobile applications. Quoting from the Verge, A search for a restaurant will offer a link directly to that restaurant page in the OpenTable app if you have it installed, allowing you to set up a reservation. Or a recipe search will bring you to the result directly inside of the AllRecipes app — rather than the mediocre mobile website. This seemingly small feature, called deep-linking, will change the way users interact with their mobile phones. To date, mobile app content has been siloed behind rectangular chiclets. Looking for a document? Can’t remember if it’s stored in Evernote, Box, Gmail or Dropbox? Today, finding it means loading each application and performing search within the four applications. In the next few months, you’ll be able to type in a few keywords in Google search, discover the document you’re looking for is in Gmail and with one click, be taken to that email in the Gmail app. In addition to creating a much better user experience, deep-linking enables five important secular trends in mobile: First, mobile application developers will use mobile search engine optimization to re-engage users. With search deep-linking, content within applications will be surfaced in search results driving users back with greater frequency. This is critical because today the only tools available to mobile application developers to draw users back to their applications are push lifecycle marketing tools email and push notifications. Search is a user action, a pull, laden with intent. Second, mobile commerce will boom. Google’s technology will send users deep within mobile applications, instead of the degraded mobile web experiences whose high friction payment experiences cause users to abandon their carts. Because applications store identity and payment credentials, these apps enable 1-click payments and will user conversion rates substantially. Third, new advertising opportunities will be created for developers. I suspect Google will enable bidding for premium position in the search results. Imagine a user with two different travel booking applications, eg. Kayak and Orbitz. When the user initiates a search on Google for flight, each of these mobile applications would likely be willing to bid on premium placement to capture the transaction. Fourth, search deep-linking solidifies Google search as the default first action for every user on android.  Like on the web, search will provide the fastest means of accessing content on a mobile phone. Fifth, search deep-linking will re-inforce native application dominance. The better UX afforded by native apps and the easier payment flows will finally be accessible to the billion Android users and their tens of billions of monthly search queries. Given the volume of Google searches on mobile phones, and the fountain of traffic Google mobile searches present, I expect developers will go to great lengths to integrate with Google’s search deep-linking and for them to be handsomely rewarded. Deep-linking, despite its small and unnoticed entry, heralds a new era for mobile apps.

Every SaaS business suffers from churn . If churn isn’t managed properly, the lost revenue from churned customers offsets new revenue and the business flat-lines or suffers negative revenue growth. I’ve seen startups employ three patterns for offsetting churn: acquiring new customers faster, upselling existing customers to buy more software, or structuring pricing to grow with customers. Each strategy requires different levels of investment but achieves similar results. These strategies are often deployed in addition to a customer success team , which require their own investment . Below, I’ve modeled a hypothetical company which grows from 100 to 50,000 customers. The business charges an average of $20k per year (ACV) and loses 20% of their revenue to churn annually, net of customer success efforts. For each strategy, I show the investment required to offset revenue churn. Customers 100 1,000 10,000 50,000 ACV 20,000 20,000 20,000 20,000 Revenue

The New Customer Acquisition strategy means acquiring new customers to fill the void of churned customers. This is the most expensive strategy to mitigate churn because each new customer costs about 15 months’ worth of contract value to acquire. Plus, the sales team must grow to field these customers. At 10,000 customers, or a $200M run rate, the company must invest $50M in acquiring new customers just to sustain their revenues. If, like most SaaS companies , this one invests about 50% of revenue into sales and marketing, they can generate a 40% total revenue increase, half of which goes to filling the vaccuum left by churn. Then the company’s growth is capped at 20% annually. The Account Growth strategy requires account managers within the startup to sell more seats or units of the software to existing customers. By growing 20% accounts from $20k ACV to $25k in the first year, account managers offset churn. Upselling existing customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new customers because a relationship exists already. This model assumes 20% conversion to upsell rate which implies the average contract value for upsold customers must double to $40k. This hypothetical strategy requires the same number of people and labor costs to achieve, but it costs 1/10th the investment of the New Customer Acquisition Strategy because there is no additional CAC. The Organic Growth strategy is likely most efficient but necessitates tradeoffs. As customers’ needs grow, so does pricing. In this example, if all renewing customers’ revenues grow on average 20% in a year, their growth offsets the churn. The costs of this approach are likely very much lower than the others because the cost of growth is borne by the customer. However, this model only works for particular types of companies, those with utility based pricing or products that enable self-service out grow of contract requirements. So it is hard to model generically. Also, this model trades “frictionless” organic growth for the revenue predictability offered by contracts, another tradeoff. These three churn mitigation strategies are rarely employed independently, but are often combined. Only in the case of this hypothetical startup is the distinction between them stark and clean. Most startups blend new customer acquisition, account growth and organic growth to nullify churn impact on revenue growth. But I think this framework models the efficiency of each tactic well enough to inform a strategic conversation about which channels are the best ones to keep the business growing.

How do you validate an idea for a software startup before the product is built? Last week, a founder of a SaaS business and I were wrestling with this problem. It’s a question without a universal answer. After a while, we came up with quick and dirty rule of thumb for his business. Can he hit his quota? Suppose this founder wasn’t the founder, but the first inside sales hire for the startup. His annual quota would be around $300k or about $25k per month. He would likely commit to a four month quota ramp, needing to reach of 25% of quota ($6k) in the first month, 50% in the second ($12k) and so on. With his mockups/demo in hand and given 30 days, could he sell $6k worth of vaporware and become confident of achieving his second month’s quota? Would customers agree to buy the product at the target price, if it were built? This quota test is a harsh one. Most inside sales reps arrive with a sales script, warm leads, a known sales path and a working product. For founders, none of this exists. Founders start from scratch. Despite its severity, I think there are five benefits to this approach: The quota test demands the team understand and identify potential customers, contact them and establish initial pricing - aka getting out of the office and validating the idea. The quota test prepares the team for eventually building inside saless, because the founders will know from experience what it takes to sell the product. The wireframes sales process unearths missing features that block product adoption (eg, integrations with other software, compliance, stability, SaaS vs. on-prem) and surfaces other customer objections (eg long term contracts with competitors, politics, etc.) Should the team succeed in the quota test, the startup will have established that an inside sales model is a viable growth strategy for the company. The sales funnel data is a tremendous asset during fund-raising because it establishes customers’ willingness to pay, reference customers and some basic sales funnel metrics. This test isn’t for every software business. The quota test doesn’t work for freemium businesses who acquire individual users to gin up leads with the aim of converting a department or company later; nor for network effect businesses whose value can only be experienced after critical mass is established; nor for businesses who will never build inside sales teams. But it is a tactic worth adding to the product/market fit toolkit for software ideas. What other tactics have you found to validate product/market fit? Tweet me.

There’s an interesting phenomemon occurring in founder compensation for post-Series A companies: founding CEOs are swapping cash for larger equity stakes in their companies. Founding CEO salaries, post Series A, have fallen by about 24% while founder equity has increased by 32%. This trend is broad. Each year, Redpoint portfolio companies participate in a compensation survey along with the portfolio companies of about 50 other firms, totaling about 800 startups. A third party pools the data to benchmark compensation trends across the executive functions in startups (CEO, VP of Product, VP of Marketing, VP of Sales, and so on) across the different financing series, locations, development stages and founders vs non-founders. While I can’t be certain why the trend towards equity is occurring, I suspect that many startups are founded by younger entrepreneurs who don’t demand larger salaries and prefer equity. In any case, this patterns startups in two ways: First, smaller salaries for CEOs reduces burn and lengthens the time startups can iterate their way to success. In addition to reducing the CEO’s contribution to the burn rate, the CEO’s salary is often the benchmark for compensation packages of most employees, so lower CEO salaries cascade through the company. Second, founders own more of their businesses at the same stage which means less ultimate dilution should the business raise more capital. This is likely a product of higher valuations at earlier stages. In aggregate, these figures point to a friendly enterpreneurial environment, one in which founders can command higher premiums for their businesses, trade salary for equity and bet big on their own success.

There’s a perptual and roaring debate in Startupland about the ideal founding team. Should the ideal team be entirely computer scientists? How important to success is having an MBA/business person? What about the stories of billionaire dropouts? To answer that question, I’ve aggregated the academic backgrounds of 30 of the top startups of the past few years and analyzed the make up of each of those founding teams. Above is a chart comparing the number of “billion” dollar startups by the total number of founders and the share of technical founders. Here are the key observations of this data: The average founding team has 2.4 founders; the median is 2 54% of teams have at least one technical founder 37% of teams are exclusively computer scientists 30% of teams have no technical cofounders 15% of founders have dropped out of an undergraduate or graduate degree program 10% of founders have an MBA The sample size here is small, only 30, and by definition each one of these companies is an exception. But a few patterns emerge from the data. First, there is no clear correlation between the fraction of technical founders and the ultimate success of the business. In this data set, there are an equal number of successful non-technical teams as technical teams as semi-technical teams. The share is split a third to each. Second, there are as many dropouts as MBAs among these teams, which asks more questions about education than it answers. Third, looking through the data, there is a slight bias towards technical teams in enterprise companies particularly where technology is the main differentiator. No surprise there. But in the consumer world and in software as a service, there seems to be no patterns. For every Pinterest, there’s an Uber; for every Box.net, there’s a Workday. The data confirmed what I believe: great founding teams can come from anywhere.

This week, Netflix announced its US userbase grew to 31M subscribers surpassing HBO for the first time. The magnitude of Netflix’s milestone is hard to overstate. In a bid to compete with Netflix, HBO has partnered with Comcast, which serves 21M subscribers, to trial an Internet-only subscription plus HBO , the first time HBO is available to US consumers without a full cable subscription. It’s a clash of behemoths. Separately, the NY Times revealed they have amassed more than 700,000 digital subscribers who provide upwards of 20% of circulation revenues and grow about 40% year over year. The data flatly countermands arguments against the paywall when it launched two years ago. By my tally, the number of streaming music customers in the US is on the order of 5M. Pandora has 2.5M , Spotify has more than 1M ; Apple, Google, Rdio and others likely sum to roughly the remaining million. If Spotify’s growth is any indication, the market is growing at more than 100% per year. Across news, music and television, consumers have embraced digital subscription services. While this trend may seem like a foregone conclusion today, the jury was out as recently as 24 months ago. And subscription services are spreading. The most recent example of this is the wave of monthly book-subscription services offered by Scribd , Oyster and 24Symbols launched in the last month or two that provide access to a huge library of books for a monthly fee. Comixology, provider of digital comic books and subscriptions, counts more than 1M users and 200M comic book downloads. I think this is only the beginning because these models benefit both the consumers and the providers. Subscription services enable users to explore and discover. For service providers benefit from consistent revenue streams and negative working capital, two very attractive financial characteristics well established in the Software-as-a-Service market. Excluding traditional media, there aren’t many consumer subscription services of scale today. But I suspect there is a secular change in the way people consume media that will favor more consumer subscription services in the future.

Intent to purchase is the engine of the consumer web. Creating and capturing intent motivates almost every dollar invested into ecommerce and advertising. Intent is also the fuel for the Internet’s most successful business model, Google’s AdWords + Search. As the internet has evolved, so have the ways of creating and capturing intent. From display to search to retargeting to collections, each new technique has leveraged data in a novel form to discover consumers’ wishes. I believe we’re at the beginning of the next wave of mining that intent using anticipatory computing. In the mid and late 90s, display advertising predominated. Search evolved and was perfected in the early 2000s. Search and search ads ushered in an era of measuring return on advertising spend. A dollar spent on ads could be proven to generate more than a dollar in sales. The user intent funnel looked like this: Then, Quigo and Blue Lithium and others pioneered behavioral targeting/retargeting which uses information about users to target ads. As users traverse the internet, they leave Hansel and Gretel breadcrumbs that reveal intent when aggregated. These breadcrumbs are most useful when fresh but become stale quickly. Behavioral targeting balanced the targeting of search with the breadth of display ads. In 2009, Pinterest and Houzz started providing tools for users to collect, organize, present and share things. Some subset of these collections are wishlists and to-buy lists, which are very direct expressions of intent, second only to search in value. Collection is today broadly adopted by tens of millions of users. This explicit intent-to-purchase data has never before been captured at scale. While the monetization of this intent is still arguably nascent, the means to generate revenue from it is straightforward at this point, affiliate sales or on-site commerce, and the market opportunity before these companies is quite simply massive. Today, we’re on the precipice of an entirely new way of doing so which I’m calling anticipatory computing. Anticipatory computing , which is best demonstrated by Google Now, pre-empts users with answers before users can ask questions. How long will it take to commute home? When will my Amazon Prime package arrive? What will the weather be today? Google Now tells me those things each day. Google Now is possible because of the gigantic amounts of user data created on the web. Those same technologies that drive answers to daily questions will be applied to uncovering intent and proactively prompting users to drive commerce. Today, there are some early and crude concepts of this: notify me by when an item drops below a certain price or allow me to pre-purchase Grand Theft Auto 5 before release or send me a text message coupon when I walk past a BestBuy. I’m not sure precisely what anticipatory commerce will look like and how to solve the signal to noise ratio. But given the amount of data users have created using collections and breadcrumbs left on the web, I’m hopeful we will see some tremendous innovation and some very large companies changing the way intent is harnessed on the web.

Financial statements are the Rosetta Stone for a business. They are the most succinct way of communicating how a business operates to management teams and boards, who weigh the trade-offs of different investments. In the early stages of the startup, financial statements aren’t used much as a management tool. They are most often used to keep an eye on monthly burn rate. But as companies grow, startups hire leaders to manage marketing and sales and product and engineering. These functional teams require money to achieve their goals. Investments include recruiting, structuring sales quotas, developing software, buying ads, hosting events, or expense accounts to close customers. Each functional team makes overlapping demands on the capital of the business. Different investment strategies can lead to dramatically different outcomes for a business. Being able to model and communicate those future scenarios is essential for good management. At a recent board meeting one of the companies I work with, I saw a board management style I hadn’t seen before. This board member is exceptionally good at managing a business through financial statements. During the board meeting, this board member surfaced many the strategic issues facing the business in the next 18 months entirely from the financial statements: the structure of the sales and marketing teams, the timing of new product features, sales quotas, marketing budget, sales efficiency and future fund raising plan. With the right lens, the balance sheet, the cash-flow statements and profit & loss statements tells the history of a business and projects its future.

In the past 24 months, something extraordinary has happened. The value of publicly traded SaaS companies has grown by 200 to 400% while the underlying customer unit economics of those businesses hasn’t changed. Below is a chart of the ratio between enterprise value to revenue for two segments of SaaS companies. The All Segment contains 36 publicly traded SaaS companies. The High Fliers comprises the upper half. From about 2004 to 2011, the average publicly traded SaaS company held an EV/Rev multiple of 3 to 5x. Since 2011, that figure has been multiplied by 4 to 7 times. Today, those ratios stand at 12 to 20x. This dramatic acceleration has increased startup valuations in parallel. Twelve months ago, I saw most SaaS startups raising in the 5 to 10x this year’s revenue range. In the past few months, valuations have soared to nearly double those multiples higher for some exceptional startups. Investors, who have witnessed the public comparables double in value, are increasingly willing to move further out on the risk/reward curve. How can this be? We know cost efficiencies are’t the driver behind these trends. SaaS companies haven’t been able to dramatically reduce their sales and marketing expense. Revenue growth is the main driver. In the 2004 to 2009 period, average revenue growth for SaaS companies hovered around 25%. In 2010, SaaS companies as a whole began investing more to grow faster and in the past three years, average growth rates have risen to about 35%. But this came at the expense of reducing net income to revenue by about half. In other words, these business take 50% of their profits and reinvest in growth. Ostensibly, the revenue growth figure is skewed by the surge in young SaaS IPOs which should grow faster than their older, more established brothers. But, that’s not quite true. This bar chart shows the distribution of the top 50% of SaaS companies by EV/Rev multiple. The distribution is quite even. Older and younger companies are fetching these huge multiples indicating the valuation increase trend is broad. There’s no question that SaaS has brought a revolution to users and administrators in terms of software ease of use, accessibility and management. Today, that value is handsomely and disproportionately rewarded in the public markets. But these trends have a way of reverting to the mean over time.

At all hands meetings on Tuesday afternoons, our 75 person AdSense Ops team reviewed the most important metrics for the business: top-two box customer satisfaction scores, revenue growth and customer churn. But unlike every other all hands meeting I attended, these meetings ended with a monkey and a dog. Our director, Kim Malone, would stand up and call for two stuffed animals, first, Whoops the Monkey and Second, Duke the Dog, both of whom employees had carried to the meeting. At the mention of Whoops, a handful of team members would stand up and one-by-one retell the story of a mistake, big or small. It might have been a mishandled customer case, a forgotten internal data analysis or causing a car accident on the way to work. Often, the team’s managers and directors contributed anecdotes.  Once or twice, an employee’s Whoops mistake cost Google millions of dollars. After hearing all the yarns, the team voted on the worst mistake and Whoops would be thrown from one side of the room to the other, finding the “winner” of the competition who would put the monkey in his or her cubicle for the week. Then Duke the dog was summoned. In contrast to Whoops’ self-reported monkeywrench mistakes, Duke stories are retold by someone else and the dog is a reward for service to the team that went above and beyond the call of duty. Several Googlers would stand and tell a story of a teammate’s dedication: how a colleague alerted them of a problem in a customer’s account, or stayed late that week to process unusually high customer support volumes, or released an internal tool that might have increased our productivity dramatically. Again, the team would vote on the stories and Duke would be bestowed on the winner. Then, the all hands meeting adjourned. Despite their childlike simplicity, Duke and Whoops, were incredibly effective management tools. Whoops created a culture of honesty and transparency, where mistakes were shared in an environment of openness, trust and support. With Whoops, Kim created a culture that valued learning and camraderie over pride. Duke celebrated our internal successes. Each week, we wanted to win Duke because we knew whatever effort we contributed at the very least would be celebrated before our teammates and Duke, prominently displayed on in our cubicle would remind our teammates and start conversations. That knowledge made us all work harder. To the individual, it mattered who won Duke and Whoops. But sharing all of the stories, building a community based on shared experience and trust, was far more important and beneficial to the team. The dog and the monkey were tools to weave a fabric of shared experience and create a culture of strong values. The first time I interviewed at Google, Kim told me about a book she was writing. A little more than 8 years later, Kim has finally published that book . This week, I’d like to nominate Kim for Duke because of her perseverance and her commitment to achieving her dream.

When I was a teenager I read a book called Barbarians at the Gate about KKR’s leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. Two journalists detail the dramatic struggle for power and control of the company between Henry Kravis of KKR and Nabisco’s CEO Ross Johnson.  From that point, I was hooked on business history. In the valley, there’s a massive collection of verbal history that is passed around. There are anecdotes of Google’s early days with a high burn rate, personal chefs, unbending founders and without a business model in sight; the handful of times Netflix had just enough cash to make payroll that week; the tactics and psychology behind LinkedIn Series B pitch deck ; the genesis stories of YC starlets Those yarns enthrall me because they reveal the relationships, the biases and passions that form the truth, from one observer’s point of view, about how and why things unfolded the way they did.  Many of these events effected dramatic change on the technology landscape. Today, there is no place to collect those stories. Quora has bits and pieces of that lore. Blogs capture scraps. Books like Steven Levy’s In the Plex and Hatching Twitter also collect the stories through a journalist’s lens. But these are distributed and limited to one person’s point of view. I hope one day such a Wikipedia of tech history comes into existence that validates identity, collects tales from the protagonists and distributes to entrepreneurs who can read them, dissect them and learn from them. What a Library of Alexandria it would be for the world of technology and startups.

Freemium SaaS and free-to-play games have a lot in common. If you’ve ever harvested crops on Farmville or raised an army in Dragons of Atlantis, you’ve experienced an aspirational product. The same is true if you’ve signed up to use a freemium CRM, expense reporting tool or note taking app. Freemium SaaS businesses, like free-to-play gaming companies, seek to build a large funnel, extract data from the free users, and leverage that data to increase the conversion and retention of users into long-term paying customers. In the recent golden age of free-to-play gaming, the leading companies developed playbooks to measure and maximize motivation. Many of these techniques apply directly to freemium SaaS products. This presentation from HoneyTracks , a gaming analytics company, describes gamer lifecycle management and many of the learnings are applicable to SaaS companies. Below are the three slides I found most compelling. First, in gaming like SaaS, better retention creates dramatically more value for the company. Although retention data is the last to be generated by the user, it should be the first metric analyzed by a product team. Growing quickly through viral or paid channels is foolish if the product can’t retain users. Measuring retention is a science, but maximizing it is art. Different techniques include on-boarding tutorials, customer success teams , lifecycle and drip marketing campaigns, product/customer discovery . Second, there are different metrics for each stage of product development. Initially, these are engagement metrics. Next, acquisition metrics. Then, monetization. The sequence is critical to maximize the leverage from the funnel. More importantly, recognizing different metrics are important at each stages helps a startup focus and prioritize product and engineering initiatives. This focus should help improve those metrics. Third is a list of the top six metrics for measuring retention, a tactical roadmap for getting started. When you want to encourage your users to update their contact database this week, think Mercury Melons . Tweet these quotes: “Though retention data is the last to be generated by the user, it should be the first metric analyzed by a product team.” Tweet

It’s an important question and one that arises most often as a SaaS startup scales. Churn, masked by growth, becomes a limiting factor of growth. How much should the business invest in managing churn? Our SaaS benchmarks from earlier this week tell us the average public SaaS company has a 3% monthly revenue churn or a 2 year lifetime and a sales efficiency of 0.8, which implies a 5 quarter pay back period on cost-of-sales and cost-to-serve. Using those numbers, the contribution revenue chart for a typical customer looks like this. The revenue of the first 15 months pays for the acquisition costs and the remaining 9 months before the customer churns are contribution margin. Presuming the business signs customers to 12 month contracts, a customer who renews pays a year’s worth more of contribution margin minus the customer success team’s salaries. To be worth the investment, customer success must drive at least drive one more month’s worth of margin in addition to the 9 created by the standard, 2 year-and-out customer. Assume a customer success team can save 30% of customers who are at risk. In the success case then, the contribution revenue chart looks like this: For the remaining 2/3 of cases, the chart looks like this: But on average, the customer success team saves about 4 months of contribution margin per customer which means company can spend up to 3 months' worth of contribution per customer on churn management. For a company at a $3M annual recurring revenue clip with customer ARRs of $1k, there are 3000 customers. On each, the company could spend about $156 (which is the $83 in revenue per customer, multiplied by an average gross margin of 63% in SaaS companies' early years) to save or a customer success budget of $39k per month. Of course, each company’s metrics will vary and will impact the maximum spend on customer success but the framework should hold across most subscription businesses.

Paying for an Uber is a breeze. I step out of the car and go on my way.  Behind the scenes, Uber has identified me, recorded my fare, added a gratuity, and sent me a digital receipt that I can easily forward to Expensify. That’s the way I want all my payments to be. Paying for Uber with a mobile phone is less work than using a credit card, which is the biggest competitor for share of wallet of in-person payments. As one of my partners likes to say, credit cards are fast, convenient and easy. We’re all pretty quick on the draw for our wallets. Uber’s payment system works so well because it has two key attributes: high frequency of use and a priori identity verification. Frequency of use is important because I can justify the friction of entering payment credentials once because I can amortize that cost over many transactions to justify the time savings. A priori identity/payment verification means that a merchant knows who I am and trusts that I will pay. This is a fraud protection measure. Uber knows who I am and how I’ll pay when I request a cab. The same is true for when I pay a bill at an OpenTable restaurant . But, Walgreen’s doesn’t yet have the technology to verify my identity in the same way. As a result, I can’t walk in to a Walgreen’s, scan a few items at the self-check out and walk out without being arrested for theft. It might be a few decade or so before the credit card is a relic, left to collect dust in my back pocket or desk drawer. But in cases like Uber, that I use often and with whom I share my identity, the credit card has already been relegated to an afterthought.

Anyone who has ever penned a blog post has asked, how long should this post be to maximize viewership? I’ve often wondered the same thing, particularly in the moment before I click the publish button and broadcast a perhaps-too-short-perhaps-too-long post into the Interwebs. I’ve written 256 posts in the past 18 months and I sought to understand the impact of word count on every metric I could measure: page views, time on site, time on page, bounce rate, exit rate, retweets and favorite activity. Here’s the data. In short, post length has no meaningful impact viewership, engagement or sharing. Below is a chart depicting the correlation of word count to six key metrics. In each of these cases, the correlations are small (<25%) and relatively speaking insignificant predictors of traffic. Metrics Bounce rate The fraction of visitors who came to the site to view a post and left without reading any others Exit rate The fraction of visitors who came to the site on another page and left on this post Time on page and site Self-explanatory Page views per visit The number of other blog posts read during a visit Retweet frequency and Twitter favorite activity The number of times a post is retweeted or favorited on Twitter, which often means saved to read later. My posts vary from 100 to 1100 words, with the majority between 300 and 750 and a median of 461 words. These posts aren’t exceptionally short or exceptionally long, but I imagine they are comparable with most blogs that post near-daily.  Below is the distribution of the 256 posts by word count. Plunging into the finer points of the analysis, below is a box plot demonstrating the relationship between page views and word count. I’ve bucketed posts by keyword in 200 word increments. Note the Y-Axis is Log10. The boxes show the distributions of page views in each bucket. The middle line in each box is the median, the borders of the rectangle show the 25th and 75th quartiles and the circles are outliers. More on reading box plots . There is no difference in the traffic generated by longer or shorter posts. Though the ranges of the box plots vary, the medians are all very close to each other and while the 200 keyword bucket does seem to indicate a narrow distribution of page views, the three outliers at the top indicate the conclusion is likely a product of the smaller sample size. In the end, the data reaffirms what I probably already knew to start. The best length for a blog post is the length required to capture and convey the message. No more, no less.

If a typical SaaS business loses about 2 to 3% of their customers each month to churn, the business must grow by at least 27% to 43% annually to maintain the same revenue. The idea written as an equation: Revenue Growth = Customers x Avg. Contract Value x (Growth Rate - Churn Rate) At the beginning of a SaaS startups' life, when the company generates $1M in annual revenue, churn in absolute dollar terms is small, about $300k for the year. This number is particularly easy to write off if the company is growing quickly, perhaps tripling to $3M in revenue next year. Fast forward two or three years to a SaaS company generating $15M per year and churn is now $5M per year. Then two or three years later that number could be $10M or $20M. As a startup becomes a growth stage company, churn’s importance grows substantially because the startup is beginning to fight the downward pressure of sales efficiency slowing . New sales processes take more effort and time and expense. Fast growth doesn’t mask churn rates as it once did and the absolute revenue-at-risk numbers are measured in the millions or tens of millions. At this stage, the internal capability to save revenue dollars at risk by engaging customers becomes paramount to continuing to grow the business. But scaling a team from nothing to one that can save $10M per year is no mean feat. If one account manager can handle $500k of revenue at risk per year, the customer success team must be 20 people. This is why customer success must be a core discipline of SaaS startups from the very first day. In addition to being able to scale the team with revenue/churn, the customer success team is on the front lines with customers passing feedback to product and marketing. Customer success provides a check on the sales team, ensuring the right customers are prioritized and closed. Investing early and often in customer success is essential to keeping a fast-growing SaaS business’s momentum.

One number investors use to benchmark SaaS startups across sectors and industries is sales efficiency. There are a handful of variants of this metric, sometimes called the magic number, but ultimately they all aim to provide some sense of the incremental revenue returned by sales and marketing investment. To make it more concrete, if a startup invests $500k in marketing and sales this quarter and generates $1M in incremental revenue, net of the cost to provide the service, for the next 12 months, the sales efficiency would be 2. The inverse of the sales efficiency is payback period. In the example above, customer revenue reimburses sales and marketing costs in ½ year or about 6 months. Sales efficiency is a helpful, high-level indicator. When sales efficiency figures fall below one and elongate pay-back periods, it’s likely time to revisit sales and marketing techniques or explore up-sell and cross-sell. When these figures exceed one, it’s likely time for a business to invest more capital into the sales and marketing efforts. Below are the sales efficiency benchmarks for the approximately 20 publicly traded SaaS companies calculated on an annual basis by years since founding. I used revenue x gross margin in these analysis, rather than contribution revenue (revenue - COGS on a unit basis) because the public financials for these businesses don’t reveal unit economics. Thanks to @angusdav for making this point. The raw data is here. There is wide variance among them. LinkedIn is the upper outlier. I suspect their tremendous efficiency is driven by the network effect growth coupled to four products sold mostly through self-sign up (ads, recruiting subscription product, a sales subscription product and a consumer subscription). Most SaaS companies operate around the 0.8 mark, meaning the business pays back the cost of the revenue and sales expense in the 5 quarters of the customer. Obviously, contract durations and churn rates are critical components of these figures that are masked by the sales efficiency metric. The figure below smooths the magic numbers across these companies and removes the outliers. In a company’s early years, rapid growth is driven through efficient sales and marketing spend. Over time, as companies mature and reach market saturation, the sales efficiency decreases, lengthening payback periods for marketing and sales investment. The sales efficiency metric is a solid high level indicator of sales and marketing performance and a useful management tool.

For most startups, a website or mobile app is the primary place to establish and reinforce a brand, a critical part of building a valuable company . But brand health tends to be a hand-wavy, amorphous concept. A founder and head of marketing at a company I worked with posed this simple but brilliant question to concretely gauge brand health: If you removed the logo from the website/mobile app, could our customers identify the experience as ours? Below are three photos. One of a mobile app, one of a web app and one of a store designed to trigger the question, without a logo, can I identify the company who designed this experience? Mobile App Branding Which app produced this photo? Instagram, no question. The distinctive filters are synonymous with the product and so distinctive, consumers identify most filtered photos as Instas. Web App Branding Who operates each one of these search engines? Click to enlarge the photo.
![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_8_600092996) If you said Google on the left and Bing on the right, you’re correct. But for most, it’s nearly impossible to differentiate the two product experiences which may be by design on Bing’s part. By emulating Google’s pages, Microsoft misses the opportunity to cultivate a different brand experience for search in users' minds. Experience Branding How about this store? Whose is it? No logos anywhere, but it’s clearly an Apple Store. Your Startup Cover your website or mobile app’s header. Can you tell if your product is your own? And your employees? Or your customers?

Over the course of the past few months, I’ve built six projects that use APIs from Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, Mailchimp and others. These APIs enable me  to extract data that I use to analyze this blog and build tools to be more effective. Once I extract the data from their platforms, no API platform understands why or how I use the data. While web companies measure many things on websites and mobile apps, very few apply the same rigor to APIs. I believe the simple API will evolve to become an API Hub. An API Hub combines starts with access to an important API and combines access to other APIs with the infrastructure needed to process all that data in one place. An API Hub offers the ability to create something useful. When I connect to an API today, I request some data (tweets), combine it with some other data (traffic), and then create something useful, whether it’s an automated report (tweets correlation to traffic) or some kind of internal tool (twitter recirculation). A third party server, in my case an Amazon box on Heroku, processes all this data. An API hub would provide Google an understanding of which data sets API users frequently combine with Google Analytics data, what analyses users perform on Google data and the products that are built using those API features, which could provide insight into Google’s roadmap. Users would pay for an API hub the way I pay for an Amazon server today to process my data. The API hub could stem the losses incurred from operating APIs by charging for the ongoing compute for analysis. APIs offer two key value propositions to end customers: data portability (move data to another provider) and data access.  But they offer little to the platform serving the API, aside from assuaging customer data portability concerns. By combining elastic infrastructure and a seamless way of connecting other data sources, an API hub creates strategic insight into customer use cases, informing the roadmap, generating revenue and retaining customers.

On this blog, Twitter is the second largest source of traffic. Twitter yielded 21% of visitors in the last 30 days. Because I suspect that tweets containing my blog’s links don’t reach a very large proportion of my Twitter followers, I’m experimenting with traffic recirculation techniques by retweeting older articles periodically. Of the approximately 150 posts on Svbtle, I have recirculated 30. Recirculation encompasses the science and tactics of enticing users to read more articles during one session and also increase the number of visits to a site. Understanding recirculation is the key to maximizing the value of content. Below is a chart of the average number of retweets a post receives the first, second and third time I tweet it. On average, each subsequent attempt gains about 75% of the previous number of retweets - a very encouraging metric. Looking at the data more closely, I noticed there are two segments of tweets: those with 1 to 3 initial retweets and those with 5 to 14 initial retweets. Recirculating a moderately successful post, one with about 2 initial retweets, results in about 2 more retweets. But recirculating a very successful post, one with on average 9 retweets, creates a cascade of another 4 retweets. This implies that the initial retweet count is likely a reasonable first-pass leading indicator of recirculation success. The correlation coefficient between the number of tweets during the first recirculation attempt and the second is strong at about 0.70. This suggests I should recirculate every post with greater than about 5 initial retweets programmatically. I suspect each publication, given its individual characteristics like scale, subject matter, audience engagement, has a certain recirculation pattern. Determining those segments and using the behaviors of those segments to inform recirculation is an essential part of maximizing the publication’s effectiveness. Also, I suspect that recirculation data is the best way of understanding the type of content a publication’s audience prefers to read. Next, I aim to research the relationship between retweets, recirculation, mail subscriptions, keywords in a blog post and traffic. When the project is completed, I’ll post the code.

Deserve is a toxic word. During my junior year in college, I trained like crazy to make the varsity boat on the crew team. Two workouts per day for six days a week during the four week Christmas holiday and on through winter training. That winter, I set a personal record for a 2000m sprint. In April, we left for Georgia and Augusta River for spring training where our coach seat raced the team to decide the varsity lineup. We spent 10 days seat racing. Two boats would race for four minutes, stop, switch two people, turn around, do it again so coach could observe the delta. After the last switch, I felt elated when my name was called out on the varsity squad. But I didn’t race as a varsity oarsman that year. I spent the few weeks following spring training soothing tendinitis in my wrists, not attending practice, and not working out. I thought I deserved my seat. When I finally made it back into a boat, it was clear I was slowing the team down. I had lost my speed. Coach pulled me aside and told me I was cut from the varsity. Whenever I start a sentence with the words I deserve, I remember the run from the boathouse up the hill to my dorm with my anger, hubris and disappointment hanging around my neck. I don’t deserve anything. I have to earn my seat every day.

Credit: O’Reilly Startups, you are doing data science wrong . That’s the title of a post penned by Ryan Weald in GigaOm this week. Weald echoes DJ Patil’s idea : “product-focused data science is different than the current business intelligence style of data science.” Weald points to a different model of data scientist, an engineer, not a statistician, who can perform queries and based upon some insights, improve the product with a few code changes and a push to git. I like Weald’s post but disagree on one point. I don’t think there is one type of data scientist, but five. Quantitative, exploratory data scientists tend to have PhDs and use theory to understand behavior. I count Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google, and Redpoint’s own Jamie Davidson , among them. Varian’s team researches the advertiser dynamics within the ads auction and compares those dynamics to theoretical auction models like the Vickery auction . By combining theory and exploratory research, these data scientists improve products. Operational data scientists often work in the finance, sales or operations teams at Google. In the AdSense ops team where I started, we had a star data analyst who each week would discuss our team’s performance: our email response times, the satisfaction scores of our publishers, and changes in publisher behavior by segment. His work provided a feedback loop to improve the team’s tactics and efficiency. Only infrequently were these insights used to influence product. Product data scientists tend to belong to product management or engineering. This is the group of data scientists Weald writes about. PMs and engineers sift through logs and analysis tools to understand the way users interact a product and leverage that knowledge to refine the product. At Google, the ads quality team analyzed user clicks data to improve ad targeting. Marketing data scientists segment the user base, evaluate the performance of advertising campaigns, match product features to customer segments, and design content marketing campaigns. The marketing data scientist creates awareness and leads for the sales team, helping generate revenue. Research data scientists create insights as a product. Nate Silver is arguably the most famous of them. Silver’s work doesn’t influence a product;  the analysis is the product itself. Sometimes the data science leads to a thought leadership whitepaper, or a blog post, or a financial report.  It’s rarer for startups to employ research scientists because the output isn’t tied to revenue. But larger companies like Google do, think tanks do, financial institutions do. These five types of data scientists span almost every department of knowledge work . Sometime in the past thirty years, data science became inextricable from the day-to-day operation of these teams. Product, marketing, eng, sales all use data to make decisions. These teams use data to identify, understand and implement feedback loops and to reinforce the behavior a company desires. To talk about data scientists might be too myopic. Your startup may need a research data scientist or one with a PhD. Or it may need an engineer with an understanding of basic statistics who can work up and down the Rails stack. Or another type all together. Like any role, when hiring or recruiting a data scientist it’s important to identify what the key problems facing the business and the relevant skills the right candidate will need to solve those challenges.

A technology advantage isn’t enough to build an enduring enterprise SaaS company because at the core, all SaaS software share the same architecture. A relational database stores data and a web site presents the data. This is true for CRM (Salesforce), marketing automation (Marketo), email (Exchange), content management systems (Sharepoint) and so on. Because SaaS apps use standard databases, engineers can easily transfer the data from one database to another. I’m greatly simplifying here because differences in architecture may exist, but in principle it’s simple to extract, transform and load data from one relational database into another. It may take time to complete the process and users may suffer during the transition, but nevertheless roughly 15%+ of every SaaS company’s customers leave each year to a competitor in this way. From Pardot to Eloqua to Marketo to Silverpop. For a few years, a technology differentiator, like SaaS or mobile, might generate sales for an upstart. But time erodes that edge. The first and only SaaS marketing automation company will only lay claim to that title for so long. The three enduring types of competitive advantage for SaaS companies I’ve observed are network effects, data network effects and ecosystem creation. Data Network Effects exist when the value of additional data is compounded with time. For example, Infer builds predictive scoring models that prioritize leads for sales teams. The more data Infer gathers about a sales team’s customers, the better their predictive ability. If a customer switched to a competitor after twelve months, the customer would destroy 12 months’ worth of machine learning, quite an expensive tradeoff. Network Effects exist in enterprise social networks, jut not just any kind of network. Email and chat systems suffer from fungibility. GMail arguably serves an Outlook business just as well. Instead, data network effects exist when the SaaS company forges a new network with novel relationships like LinkedIn for recruiting, Axial and Angellist for finance, Doximity for doctors and so on. Those networks are proprietary and long-lasting competitive barriers to entry. Ecosystem Creation: when a SaaS business surrounds itself with successful partners who serve many different types of customers, often not addressed by the SaaS company, and reinforce the value of the SaaS product, it has employed an ecosystem defense. Salesforce fosters its Force.com ecosystem to further entrench use of its CRM. Veeva, a company building pharmaceutical sales software on Salesforce, filed for a $150M IPO last month, after growing revenues more than 100% y/y. Veeva customizes Salesforce for a particular industry which attracts and retains customers better than Salesforce could. More Veeva sales means more revenue to Salesforce. Similarly, Microsoft has a vibrant created vendor ecosystems that sells, customizes and services their products. Not every SaaS business needs one of these three defensive strategies to succeed. In fact, many SaaS businesses never do create one. But I think the truly great ones do.

The single best content marketing channel is email subscriptions powered by Twitter/social media distribution. Thirty days ago, I began an experiment with this blog to determine whether email, Twitter or RSS would be the better content marketing channel. My goals with RSS, Twitter and email are two: first to maintain a relationship with a reader longer than a single website visit by creating a communication channel and second to use that marketing channel to drive re-engagement. Below, I’ve analyzed the results and come across some surprising findings. First, RSS subscribers generate more traffic than email subscribers. Second, email readers are much easier to win than RSS readers. Third, email and RSS subscribers tend to be very different audiences and these channels do not cannibalize each other.  Fourth, Twitter’s performance on a unit basis pales in comparison to its competition, but makes it up in volume. Note, the code to perform a web, rss and email analysis is at the bottom of this post, in case you’re interested in analyzing your startup’s content marketing effectiveness. Email and RSS Conversion Funnels Email and RSS subscribers open blog posts at roughly equal rates; RSS is a moderate 21% better. But 2.5x more people click through to the website from RSS as from email. When RSS subscribers do come to the website, they browse about half as many pages as email subscribers. Net-net, the average RSS subscriber generates about 25% more page views than an email subscriber. The most effective content marketing strategy is to combine Twitter’s distribution capacity with email’s conversion rates and broad applicability. Email RSS Twitter Delta Open Rate 51% 62% n/a 21% better for RSS Click through to site 23% 80% 4.5% 250% better for RSS Page views per visit 2.3 1.2 2.0 91% better for email Expected Page Views per 100 Subscribers 127 159 9 25% better for RSS Subscriber Volumes 454 1567 9874 530% better for Twitter Other Interesting Data Points from the Analysis Absolutely no one forwards the Mailchimp emails. Of 6500+ emails sent, 0 were forwarded. On average, this blog acquires 13 new email subscribers daily which is roughly equal to the number of new organic Twitter followers added per day, 15 and about 4 times greater than the 4 new RSS subscribers per day in the same period. At current course and speed, I expect email to surpass RSS in 64 days' time. 0.3% of visitors to the blog subscribe via email. I don’t have a comparable RSS metric because of the way Feedburner collects these figures. 3% of email subscribers or about 13 people have unsubscribed in the past 30 days. Given that small volume, I assume no cannibalization and no overlap in user base with RSS which counts about 1500 subscribers. Email subscription growth has a weak correlation to traffic, only about 0.58 R 2. This means that traffic spikes typically generate traffic that bounces - visits once and doesn’t return. I wish I could cookie users and understand how many impressions it takes to entice someone to become a subscriber. RSS CTRs are 3x greater than the emails, despite the fact that I syndicate full blog posts into the feed. I’m not sure what the driver is here, The Story in Charts Traffic is indicated in gray, new subscribers in red and unsubscribers in blue. Email signups are volatile and aren’t tightly coupled to traffic, meaning the blog fails to convert many new visitors driven by large volumes of retweets or HackerNews traffic spikes to subscribers. 
![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_14_285062039) This chart shows share of traffic by channel. Email has grown from about 0 to 15% in 30 days. RSS is also growing and has reached about 20% of page views. Twitter represents about 23% of traffic. On an average day, about 55 to 60% of traffic is brought to this blog through reader marketing channels.  The figures are incredibly volatile,  however.

The three words roll off the tongue: monthly recurring revenue (MRR). What’s not to love about subscription models? Negative working capital, predictable revenue growth and an average of 13x market cap to annual revenue in the public markets, with some darlings reaching 50x multiples. The list goes on. But the words recurring revenue belies one small detail. These recurring customers must renew their subscriptions, at which point another three word phrase is uttered: revenue-at-risk, the amount of MRR that might be lost to customers who choose not to re-enlist. Recurring revenue isn’t an iron-clad figure. It’s subject to the rust caused by customer churn. The oft-quoted MRR figure is an optimistic one because it assumes 100% retention rate. Instead, a better metric for MRR might be the expected value of monthly recurring revenue, something along the lines of eMRR = MRR * (1-churn rate) The problem with eMRR is that typical SaaS churn rates are small, varying between 1 to 3% per month, so the eMRR doesn’t capture the compounding impact of high churn rates . Nick Mehta, CEO at Gainsight , showed me another way of visualizing revenue at risk that I’ve replicated in the chart below. Each point is a customer: many customers in the same location darken the dot. The x-axis is the months since a customer subscribed (cohort) and the y-axis is the monthly recurring revenue (MRR). This report shows three different trends: How much of revenue is up for renewal assuming 12 month upgrade cycles. How the price of the product trends with time and by cohort. How sales velocity is changing with time. I like this report quite a bit, because at a glance, I can get a sense of what’s happening with the business and pull-apart the MRR metric to understand the trends in the customer base and the potential revenue at risk. Nick’s product adds one more dimension to this chart, and an important one. Gainsight integrates into Salesforce and determines on a per client basis which customers are truly at risk of churning. Instead of assuming quite broadly that all revenue in month 11 is at risk, Gainsight’s report shows you the 10 to 30% or so that truly is at risk. That data isn’t encapsulated in my chart above but is quite useful. But, if a low fidelity model is sufficient, then the R code below might be useful because it produces the chart above. The Revenue at Risk chart is a fine tool for understanding at a high level the health of the customer base and the sales velocity. It sheds light on the true health of the MRR metric.

During the past week, I’ve been tapping out letters on a 1921 Underwood portable typewriter that my wife gave me as a present. Sitting in front of it and watching the letter hammers pound ink onto paper reminded me that computer programming is still a very new field. Not 50 years ago, prehistoric programmers punched FORTRAN code on punch cards in this way. In the past 10 to 15 years has computer programming entered mainstream culture and the number of developers has soared, popularized by the dot com era and the increasing prevalence of computers and mobile phones. With the increase in developer numbers, new opportunities have arisen to build sizable businesses serving programmers. Despite developers' reputation for miserly resourcefulness, a handful of companies have built substantial businesses serving programmers. Rally and Atlassian promote agile software development techniques with workflow software. Rally filed its IPO documents earlier this year and Atlassian is sure to follow . Splunk, which generates enormous revenues from its log analysis platform, also went public. Of course, this is to say nothing of the multibillion-dollar business Amazon has built providing infrastructure to developers. Moreover, the developer ecosystem has become strategic to cash-rich monoliths. Facebook acquired mobile app development platform Parse to attract and retain mobile application developers for Facebook’s benefit. Salesforce bought Heroku, a software development and deployment platform, to complement Force.com, Salesforce’s very successful application market place. In both of these instances, and in the cases of the mobile phone wars between Apple, Google and Microsoft, programmers are the essential component to building vibrant application ecosystems and lasting competitive advantage. 10 years ago, it would’ve been easy to write off the developer community has an isolated and small constituency. But not today. Github just announced 4M user accounts . This boom in web developers and database engineers and user experience designers provides tremendous opportunity for startups to seize.

On the day of Android’s five year launch anniversary and my fifth consecutive year of using exclusively Android devices, I switched to a yellow iPhone 5c. Like a well worn pair of jeans, it’s easy to grow accustomed to a mobile phone OS. Changing into a new pair is always a little uncomfortable at first. In that same way, migrating from Android to I iOS, I discovered the quirks and kinks of each OS: The iOS keyboard always shows uppercase letters, no matter if the letter being typed is upper or lowercase. On Android, the letters on the keyboard change case as you type. On iOS’s Gmail client, you swipe to the left to archive a message. On Android, it’s to the right. To switch between applications on the iPhone 5c, double tap the home button and swipe left/right. On my Droid Razr M, tap the app switching button and swipe up/down. The default background color on iOS is white. On Android, it’s black. The volume rocker and power button are on the right side of the iPhone and the left of the Android. These phones mirror each other, Spy vs Spy embodied in circuitry and aluminum and glass. Having spent five years isolated on one platform and switched immersed in  the competing platform, I’m surprised to see how similar iOS and Android have become. The corollary to this similarity is of course how easy it is to switch between the two. We’ve reached the point in mobile phone evolution that Freud would call the narcissism of small differences . As Clive Hazell puts it, [In] postmodernity, consumer culture has been seen as predicated on ‘the “narcissism of small differences”…to achieve a superficial sense of one’s own uniqueness, an ersatz sense of otherness which is only a mask for an underlying uniformity and sameness’. Setting aside the processor arms race, the main product differentiation in mobile hardware has evolved to mobile phone customization. Will you have a backplate made of chartreuse plastic or rosewood? Of course, Android’s ecosystem is mildly inferior driven by lesser revenue opportunity that I suspect will be resolved with the growth in user base time affords . Because the differences between the operating systems and hardware are trivial and the sizes of the user bases are comparable, it seems to me that over time the Android and iOS will become true substitutes in the way MacOS and Windows never were.

I’ll never forget the first large tech conference I attended after joining Redpoint. Held in the movie theater in downtown Redwood City, the TechCrunch conference attracted several hundred entrepreneurs, investors and journalists. Not one of whom I knew. After a handful of conferences and a few awkward quick-name-badge-glance-then-say-hello conversations, I started to recognize faces and became friendly with the conference regulars. Walking into a room and working it by building a network person by person is an essential part of entrepreneurship (and venture capital). That room might be filled with potential customers to sell, investors to woo, candidates to hire, or in my case startups seeking capital. For many founders and VCs, these networking opportunities occur at least weekly if not almost daily. I’ve often wondered how to network better in those types of events. Sometimes, I scour the attendee list and make notes of people to find in the crowds. But Ferenc Huszár has a better way called the Friend Paradox. The Friend Paradox is a heuristic that maximizes the odds of finding well-connected people at networking events. It’s a two step process: Pick a random person in the crowd, and
ask her (or him) if she knows anyone at this meetup. When she points at someone, go talk to that person instead. Based on probability, the friend paradox identifies the most connected people in the room. Those superconnectors will likely to know more many more people given the scale free properties of social networks. Naturally, this means superconnectors can identify and introduce members of their network to potentially important people - a very helpful contact and friend - and precisely the kind of person to meet at a networking event.

In response to analyses published on this blog, a handful of readers have raised the idea of Simpson’s Paradox to me. Because I wasn’t familiar with it, I’ve been researching it and last week, I came across VUDLab’s beautiful website which uses a sexism-in-admission lawsuit against Berkeley to demonstrate the idea. In 1973, the University of California-Berkeley was sued for sex discrimination. The numbers looked pretty incriminating: the graduate schools had just accepted 44% of male applicants but only 35% of female applicants. When researchers looked at the evidence, though, they uncovered something surprising: If the data are properly pooled…there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. In other words, the researchers found that the aggregate metrics didn’t tell the real story. By examining the admission patterns of each department in closer detail, the researchers revealed a different truth. While on the whole, women were accepted at lower rates, it was because they were vying for spots against other women in humanities programs that were on the whole more competitive than sciences and engineering, which accepted more students from a predominantly male applicant pool. I’ve come to think that at the heart of every disruptive technology startup is Simpson’s paradox. Most people in a market holds a particular worldview which ostensibly describes the way a market works. But by investigating further, a startup may reveal that a fundamental underlying driver has changed unexpectedly.  Identifying and leveraging that change to win market share is the key to disruption. The Berkeley example reminds me of the SpaceX’s formation story Elon Musk shared at the D conference this year. Musk implicitly knew launching satellites into space would be expensive. After all, NASA’s annual budget is about $19B . But when Musk and his team analyzed each cost component of a space launch, they found that less than 10% of the costs were the rocket and the fuel and the launch equipment. This meant Musk could conceivably reduce the costs of space shipping by 80%. While it’s not a true statistical example of Simpson’s Paradox, the point is the same. The market held a worldview based on aggregate data. But Musk recognized the aggregate space costs didn’t tell the true story. By digging deeper, he and his team found a lurking explanatory variable and an opportunity to disrupt the industry. These little secrets, understanding the admission patterns of a university or the cost-structure to launch a rocket, require detective work. But digging past the facade of the truth, there’s the possibility of a different explanation and a world of possibility.

We know by heart that half of our marketing dollars are spent improperly. But what’s worse is most products waste half of their chances to deepen a relationship with their customers. There are two different kinds of email within products: product marketing emails and transactional emails. The first of these marketers optimize continuously and the other is oft forgotten. Product marketing emails include acquisition campaigns, lifecycle marketing, retention marketing, cross-selling, up-selling and content marketing. Tools like Marketo, Silverpop, MailChimp and others have solved this problem for marketing teams. After all, a startup measures its marketing team by their impact on customer engagement, retention and conversion using email metrics primarily. Consequently, marketers hone and refine and perfect these emails. Not so for transactional emails which include account creation, account confirmation, receipts and updates. At design time, they receive attention because they are part of the critical path to launch. But after launch, product marketers rarely update transactional email because to win prioritization in this week’s engineering sprint demands Herculean leverage. A marketer must prove the impact of their test before it has begun. After all, the email test will delay a bug fix or feature release by one cycle. Should a marketer curry enough favor to convince an engineer to perform the test another long cycle begins. The engineer must code, test, deploy, verify and analyze the test. These extensive cycle times prevent iteration and optimization. This is a shame because transactional email is often equal or larger in volume than product marketing emails. No matter the type, each email is a branding opportunity and a chance to engage with the customer and deepen the relationship. In the very near future, I think we will see better tools for marketers to optimize transaction emails without burdening the engineering organization. It’s a big opportunity. Ultimately, the successful solution will create an abstraction layer between marketing and engineering that allows each to focus on maximizing their contributions to the business.

As a PM at Google, I carried a laptop to every meeting I went to. I typed notes, jotted down action items, and distributed the minutes of almost each one of my meetings. I stayed organized and tracked my teams’ progress this way. But, as I learned when I starting working at Redpoint, outside the rainbow bubble of the Googleplex very few people take notes on laptops during meetings. It’s just impolite. People wonder if you’re typing emails (which I often was). After a few months, I returned to Moleskines and Pilot pens. I find it difficult to maintain paper notes. They are impossible to search. My productivity fell through the floor; I forgot things and now I often found myself sifting through sheaves of paper, photographing them to put into Evernote so I can search them. I never learnt how to take notes properly. In retrospect, note-taking should be part of a grade-school curriculum, much like typing. But I didn’t attend any such course so I don’t know how to manage a notebook well. Ryder Carroll, an Interaction Designer from Brooklyn, has documented his technique called Bullet Journal which seems to me to be an exceptionally effective way of working with paper notes. The website Ryder built to describe his technique is a masterpiece of visual design as well. Ryder summarizes the bullet journal in the video below. For anyone who meets people frequently and needs to manage their working lives on paper, Bullet Journal presents a powerful and effective discipline to increase productivity. Expect to see bullets in all my notebooks from now on.

After I wrote a post on six important cohort reports , I received a handful of questions about how to interpret cohort charts effectively. When I review cohort data from companies I work with, I look into three different trends to evaluate a product’s performance. This is a cohort chart of hypothetical product indicating percentage of monthly active users each week for 12 weeks. There’s great data here and but the amount of data can be overwhelming. Time flows down and right in the chart below. But if we simplify the analysis into three charts we can isolate three key trends that will indicate our product’s performance. These are the On Boarding Trend, the Longitudinal Trend and the Cohort Trend. The On Boarding Trend , the orange left arrow, indicates the product’s effectiveness in its first month of use and its trend over time which is nothing less than a metric for user on boarding effectiveness.  The first cell in each column indicates the monthly active rate for the cohort’s first month as users. In our hypothetical data set, that number grows varies from 35% to 41% over time. The product team has done a reasonable job of improving user on boarding and engaging users when they sign up. The Longitudinal Trend , the top red arrow, indicates how the activity rate changes as users continue to use the product. The first row is the oldest cohort of users with the most recent data, the ones who signed up most recently. The bottom row is the newest cohort. Time flows right in this chart. In our hypothetical data, there are two important conclusions. First, our user base becomes less active over time and over the past 12 weeks, we see the activity rate falling, indicating the product isn’t keeping the attention of its users. Second, the decay in user activity is relatively constant across all cohorts meaning the product improvements over the past 12 weeks haven’t made an impact. The Cohort Trend , the bottom yellow arrow, indicates the current contribution to activity of each of the cohorts. In our hypothetical example, the older cohorts contribute 1/10th the activity of newer cohorts. This means user re-engagement through marketing or product efforts should be explored in addition to finding new ways to retain users. Cohort analysis is quite useful because product teams can test different product features and measure the impact on a user base over time. Different on boarding flows will impact the on-boarding trend. New lifecycle features will alter the course of the Longitudinal Trend. Engagement tactics will change the cohort trends. Tying product changes to behavior informs great product design. There are many more analyses that can be done using cohorts, but these are the three key analyses I use that are consistently useful to evaluate product performance.

I’ve been reading Scott Berkun’s book The Year Without Pants which details his working life at Wordpress. The book reveals a thought-provoking collection of lore behind Wordpress and in particular, the day-to-day operations of a distributed volunteer team who built a technology that powers about 20% of the internet . Scott embeds insightful gems about daily startup work life into his stories. My favorite so far is this one: “Most people doubt online meetings can work, but they somehow overlook that most in-person meetings don’t work either.” It’s a brilliant little dagger into the argument for in-person meetings. He continues, “Being online does mean everyone might be distracted … [But] My theory on meetings was simple: if what is being discussed is important, people will pay attention.” Wordpress’s management team understood the power of chat and video. They also knew that many talented people didn’t live within 50 miles of their office. But if they hired a team all over the world, they needed some fabric to bind them together because managing a distributed team is challenging. By combining many communication technologies including chat and videoconferencing and blogging, Wordpress’s employees successfully collaborated and literally changed the face of the web. In the coming years, video conferencing and online meetings will become much more prevalent as stories like the ones Scott shares are told and retold. If you’re looking to understand how a fully distributed team used chat and video conferencing to build a world changing product, reading The Year Without Pants is a great way to answer those questions.

The NoSQL movement launched officially in 1999 but rose to prominence much later perhaps closer to 2008 when Hadoop and other key value pair technologies became en vogue. Today, it’s hard to argue with the success of the movement. Large banks, insurance companies, biotech companies and dotcoms rely on NoSQL to power their services and inform their most important decisions. I first saw MapReduce at Google. I’ll never forget the conversation I shared with a search engineer who described MapReduce. Separate the data, process each chunk individually, and reassemble it. That’s how it works, he told me. It was fascinating and unlike the SQL mechanics I knew. Despite wide adoption inside Google, not all products ran BigTable/Hadoop. AdWords and AdSense, the ad systems that generate the lion’s share of Google’s revenue relied on a MySQL instance. When I joined, the Ads DB was sharded across 59 machines. When I left, I counted more than 70. And these were massive machines. Since 2008, and perhaps well before, SQL interfaces for Hadoop/MapReduce have been developed because most people who interact with databases have learnt SQL, but very few write MapReduce. These bridge technologies enable more developers and users to leverage the database. This is true at Google too. But these translation layers create bottlenecks and are imperfect translations of the underlying technology which is why the company built a new database called F1 . I read about F1’s breathtaking performance with incredulity. F1 promises the performance and transaction support of an SQL database with the scale of a NoSQL database. Most importantly, it enables anyone who speaks SQL to query large volumes of data rapidly. F1 is a database technology almost without compromises (setting aside the read and write latencies). The pace and breadth of innovation in databases is accelerating. Each cycle enables more data to be processed, faster. Because databases are at the core of almost every application and as machine learning becomes a critical part of many products, these database improvements cascade into our daily lives in the form of intelligent assistants like Google Now, improved music recommendations in Pandora and customer prioritization software like Infer. These database innovations will create new opportunities for startups for years to come both in the form of new infrastructure and new applications that take advantage of these new database capabilities.

One of the hardest but least spoken about transitions in a startup’s life is crossing people management chasm. At the outset of the startup, there might be three people, then eight, then fifteen. As they grow, startups often create ad hoc managers I call team leads. Team leads manage 3 to 5 people. They work alongside their team, whether engineering, sales or marketing and contribute actively to achieving the goals of that team team. They code, sell or market for 50% of their time. With the remainder, team leads coordinate team members, set goals and measure progress. In company sizes around 30 to 50 or so, team lead structures work well. As the company scales, the number of team leads in the business grows, so someone must be appointed to manage the team leads. This is the people management chasm. The manager of team leads isn’t a team lead himself because he doesn’t actively contribute to any one of his team’s output - there’s not enough time to do both well. He’s a different kind of manager, a team builder. The team builder is responsible for cultivating the people within that team, recruiting and hiring additional members of the team, and guiding the team to perform at a high level. The team builder spends 90%+ of his time in one-on-one meetings, recruiting meetings and progress evaluation meetings. CEOs are team builders almost from the very first day of a startup’s life. Crossing the people management chasm, hiring the first people manager, is challenging. After all, the interview process used to evaluate individual contributors is no longer valid. Nor will annual review processes work - the metrics to evaluate a manager’s performance differ from an individual contributor. Suddenly all the criteria have changed. What got you here won’t get you there. At this point, the startup has to develop another competency: how to hire and manage people managers. Like other skills, successful startups research this competency by speaking with experts, solicit advice from well-known and successful managers and founders who have done this before. They speak with recruiters before launching search processes about the kinds of managers who will fit best into their startup’s culture and they iterate on their interview and evaluation processes. Crossing this chasm is the key to growing the business.  It’s not easy but it’s essential.

One of the most frequent questions entrepreneurs ask me is how does their business compare to others? Benchmarking is a great tool, if you can get access to representative data. Pacific Crest and David Skok have released a fantastic survey benchmarking SaaS metrics for early and growth stage companies. The entire report is well worth reading . Below is my list of the six most important benchmarks and observations from that report. Inside Sales Driven Companies Grow Fastest Inside sales driven distribution companies grow about 40% faster than companies using field sales, web sales or channel, or about 37% revenue growth per year. Price the Product Between $1k to $25k Annually to Optimize Growth Companies with contract sizes of $1k to $25k grow the fastest, about 26% faster or 35% y/y. I suspect there are two reasons to support this pattern. First, purchases under $25k tend to require fewer approvals which decreases sales cycle. Second, these accounts can be closed by inside sales reps which are far less expensive than field sales. On the same sales investment, a startup may be able to hire three or four inside sales reps for each field sales rep. Cost of Customer Acquisition is About 11 Months' of Revenue The median startup spends about 92% of first year average contract value on the sale, implying an 11 month payback period on the CAC. An additional months' revenue is required to upsell a customer and about the same is required to close a renewal. Upsells are a Secret to Growing the Business Twice as Fast The top 50% of growers generate more upsell business than their slower growing competitors. The difference in growth rates becomes more pronounced as the business scales into the $15M+ in annual revenue range where upselling companies grow more than twice as fast. In the early days of the business, net new account growth is a priority for most businesses but the growth rate data and CAC data indicate that upselling existing customers is an important and underemphasized key to growth. Sales commission as % of ACV 9% I’ve written about When to Hire Your First Sales Person and what a hypothetical compensation plan for sales people might look like. There I assumed the typical ACV/compensation ratio was about 4:1 but in practice that number is closer to 10:1. Median Monthly Revenue Churn is 0.75% Churn rates vary dramatically by product category and customer. SMBs churn with greater frequency than enterprises and marketing software has an intrinsically greater churn rate than accounting software, so the median may be misleading for particular categories. This means each year, the median business loses about 10% of its revenue to churning customers. Benchmarking is a great first order evaluation tool. It can answer the question of whether your startup is the ballpark of other companies. But it’s important to dig into the next step and understand where your startup’s variances exist from the median and why. It could be the sales compensation plan needs revision, or it could be that you’ve captured lightning in a bottle and invented a new sales model.

The venture capital fund of the future will perform the same tasks as the venture funds of today: help portfolio companies, evaluate new investment opportunities and build networks of other investors, potential hires, and founders. But to succeed over the next 25 years, venture capital firms must increase the scale and sophistication of each of these duties by order of magnitude through technology. In the five years I’ve worked in the venture business, I have witnessed tremendous change in the industry driven by intensifying competition for returns. The concentration of returns IPO and M&A markets fuels VC rivals to vie aggressively for the opportunity to invest in hyper-growth startups. One company’s initial public offering, Facebook, provided 77% of returns from venture backed IPOs in 2012. In the same year, 10% of the acquisitions generated 50% of the proceeds in the M&A market. Despite a decrease in the total number of active funds, competition has never been as fierce in the venture industry as today. To triumph in this market, I believe venture capitalists must do three things. First, they must create continuous information asymmetries. Second, they must convince entrepreneurs they are the right partner. Third, they must employ technologies to benefit their portfolio companies. In the same way hedge funds scour data sources for insight on investments in the public markets, venture funds of the future will deploy technology to programmatically discover, evaluate and prioritize up-and-coming startups for partners to pursue. There has never been more data collected on startups than today. Whether it’s iOS app store rankings, web traffic growth, LinkedIn profiles, Twitter followers, job listings, Crunchbase financing history the list of data-rich sources stretches to the floor. Processing that data is the key to creating consistent information asymmetries. Having created that information asymmetry, the VC of the future will be positioned to win the investment opportunity. The venture industry has transitioned from brand building through exclusivity to an era of marketing through accessibility. The venture fund of the future must contribute to the daily conversations of founders and entrepreneurs, and foster the startup community. Those conversations occur on blogs, Twitter, LinkedIn, HackerNews, Quibb and a litany of other sites. By actively participating in the discussions, venture capitalists build rapport and demonstrate expertise which are critical in an era of fierce competition. Once committed partners, venture capital firms will use technology to further the success of their portfolio companies. This technology will take many forms including fostering internal communities, providing competitive intelligence, sharing recruiting tools, and accessing preferred legal, recruiting or marketing help. In short, the emphasis in the words financial services will shift from financial, raising and investing capital, to service. The firms that embrace technology to find entrepreneurs at the right time, engage them and assist them in achieving the success of their dreams will be the VC firms of the future.

It’s not engagement. Engagement, (time-on-site, page views, number of sessions per day) is the wrong concept because it doesn’t apply to most products. The best metric is share of habit. Engagement fails the majority of products as the best metric to optimize because maximizing engagement/time-on-site contradicts the product’s purpose. Google relentlessly whittles down the time it takes for users to complete a search. Sparrow reduces email client use. Online travel agents and e-commerce companies minimize conversion funnel duration. Expensify slashes time spent filing expenses. For other products, engagement is a good metric. Facebook and Instagram and the New York Times and YouTube and other media sites do maximize time on site. The more time on site a user spends the greater the number of ad impressions and hence revenue. But all these products seek to maximize share of habit. Google, Expedia, Sparrow, YouTube, Expensify, Facebook and Instagram share a goal to win 100% share of the instances their users search, book travel, email, watch videos, file expenses, share with friends, and take beautiful photographs. They all aim to maximize share of habit. Focusing on share of habit puts the user first. It aligns long term incentives between the product and the user because the right feature set will bring users back time and again to the product. Also, winning share of habit means understanding the environment of the user - what competition for time and attention does my user face - and creating a superior experience. As a product manager for a new product or a founder of a new startup, I would set my sights on winning share of habit. After all, every new feature, every marketing initiative, every sales pitch is meant to increase habit, stickiness, commitment, attachment to the product. That’s what winning is, winning share of habit.

In a very kind gesture, Ivan Kirigin submitted this blog (and Intercom.io’s blog) to answer the question posed by Disqus, What is the best content marketing campaign you have seen and why? I’m honored by his comment. In response, David Fleck, head of revenue at Disqus asked whether the blog has ever led to an investment and whether that’s the right KPI for it. I haven’t yet found a startup through the blog that Redpoint eventually invested in, but I’m hopeful it will one day. But this blog has helped me compete for investments. Ex Post Facto is my place to share how I think about products and markets and startups. In a recent competitive fundraising process, a founder came across the blog and read about product design philosophy and how build a sales team . The ideas resonated with him. Without spending weeks getting to know each other, he knew how I would think about his business and that gave him and his team confidence that we would work well together. Naturally, I was over the moon when he told me that. I’ve thought quite a bit about how to measure the success of this blog. A while back, I wrote that I would like to measure “the fraction of entrepreneurs and startup employees I reached the day before.” But my thinking has evolved a bit. Recently, I read a post about Adam Rifkin’s research into building networks and communities and the last few paragraphs resonated with me. There are lots of ways to measure success for the blog, but ultimately the best measure is the value it brings to the community. In particular, I want this blog to help the startup community and the best way to do that is by contributing honest writing that provokes conversation and debate, helps founders solve problems and points to areas of opportunity. That’s why I try to fashion this blog as a journal of my learning. When I write, I’m writing the thoughts I would want to read if I were an entrepreneur starting a business.

It is easy to think the sales process ends once a customer has signed a contract or downloaded an app or created an account. But it’s a huge mistake. Great products have a point of view on the way things ought to work. GMail chose labels over folders for email categorization. Pandora chose recommendations over libraries for music libraries. Looker chose spreadsheets over an SQL prompts for data exploration. None of these ideas matter if they aren’t used. People try software because they like a the product’s point of view. Customers want a better way of doing things. The decision to trial a new product is aspirational. But to truly adopt new software, customers have to change their habits. Users must convert their aspiration into new routines. They have to commit to the product’s point of view. A MadLib from the book The Power of Habit sums it up: I learned this selling billing and invoicing software to law firms. It was one thing to convince the managing director of a law firm to pay for the software over a 90 day sales cycle. But it was an entirely different matter to educate, convince and convert individual attorneys to use the software. That took far longer. But both parts of the sales process were critical to the success of the deployment. Without the sale, we didn’t make money. Without attorney adoption, our product didn’t work. It had no value and customers abandoned it. The best products combine a strong point of view with the marketing and sales efforts to change the way users live and work. The sales process starts with education but has to finish with behavior change.

I have never worked for a company that was dogmatic about project postmortems but I have always wished I had. After all, project postmortems teach us so much. Learning from the mistakes and experiences of others constitutes the better part of our business education. It’s why we ask successful entrepreneurs to coffee and hang on every word when they speak at conferences. All those stories are postmortems. Postmortems condense all the experience and learning into a nugget of shared wisdom. Despite their value, postmortems are uncommon. They exist only in delicate corporate cultures that demand excellence but support learning. Harder still, framing one’s own failure to colleagues daunts the entry-level employee as much a seasoned CEO. It’s rare to find an enterprise that conducts postmortems consistently. Very few startups do. But I came across one business in a sector I wouldn’t have expected that exemplifies the value of the everyday post-mortem. Alcoa, the Aluminum Company of America, generates $24 billion in revenue and for decades held the title of largest aluminum producer in the world. In the mid-1980s, the company hired Paul O’Neill as CEO. O’Neill changed the course of the business and doubled revenues in ten years because he instilled one particular value in the company. Unlike his predecessors who focused on increasing profitability to drive market cap, O’Neill championed safety as priority one from his very first shareholder meeting. This ostensibly odd decision created a cascade of cultural changes within Alcoa. First, it united the interests of managers and unions who had been at odds over wages and benefits. After all both sought safer working environments for their teams. Second, because every accident needed to be reported in a timely fashion according to company policy, Alcoa became one of the first large enterprises to adopt email. Last, as employees focused on reporting accidents quickly and widely, the company cultivated a culture wherein people learned from others’ mistakes and everyone benefitted as a result. Accident rates plummeted, productivity rose and the business boomed. A few years into O’Neill’s term, at a shareholder meeting, a Mexican nun (who was a shareholder of Alcoa) pointed out to the CEO that some members of her parish had suffered exposure to toxic gases working for Alcoa. The company investigated. They discovered that one of the most senior and tenured members of the management team, Bob Barton, had covered up the gas leak. O’Neill fired Barton immediately. O’Neill said later, “…no one else had the opportunity to learn [from the accident]. Not sharing an opportunity to learn is a cardinal sin.” And his employees agreed. Postmortems demand a culture of honesty and communication, two of the core values of the strongest relationships and cultures. I hope we see more of them in startups.

Mobile apps are like packaged software, a friend who is a head of product at a successful mobile first company told me over breakfast. On the web, you can launch a product that’s 80% functional to hit a promised launch date. Around 1 am that night, when most users are asleep, you can surreptitiously push an update with bug fixes and new features, reboot the servers, and no one is the wiser. iOS apps don’t work this way. A mobile app with a serious bug frustrates users for two weeks, inundates customer support for a fortnight and decreases app rankings for at least that long. Quite an expensive bug. Apple’s two week app approval window creates this dynamic. The approval latency demands higher quality software which means better testing and higher quality standards. To cope with these greater demands, developers are tweaking web tools for mobile app development. In a post on FastCo Labs, HowAboutWe’s engineering team described their quality assurance (QA) process. They combine Kiwi, KIF and CruiseControl to trigger automated tests before their iOS app releases. One of these tools is mobile specific. But Kiwi and CruiseControl are ports from Ruby web testing toolkits. Longer release cycles decrease the number of experiments a team can run because each optimization more than 2 weeks to test, measure and update. Thankfully, a handful of startups have created frameworks to dynamically test, optimize and updating mobile applications in the wild. These frameworks effectively recreate the web delivery model. With a flip of a switch on a remote server, a mobile app can improve its UI instantly. As mobile users become the majority of users , more and more of the advantages of web development will be brought to mobile applications and mobile users will be better served. What additional QA processes or tools has your startup adopted for mobile app development and testing? Let me know via tweet.

At Google, the director of my team repeated a management mantra to us quite often. “Manage yourself out of a job; make yourself redundant”, she would say. “Empower your people and then get out of the way.” Our director was a terrific team builder. Before Google, she founded a startup where she learned to build a company. When she told us her mantra, she was sharing her learnings with us. Company builders sow the seeds of a team, cultivate each teammate, promote a leader from within and then step away after the team has become capable of running itself. They are force multipliers. Where there was nothing, a self-sustaining organization has blossomed. It’s a beautiful thing. But no one talks about what happens after that process is completed. Watching company-building first-hand at a few portfolio companies, I’ve listened to founders and managers explain the challenges of being in this situation. Once a leader has managed himself out of a job, he has to be ready to find another. Being ready means a few things. First, it means letting go, ceding pride of authorship and ownership. Someone else is running the team and making the decisions. Second, it means asking two introspective questions and answering them honestly: “What does the business need next?” and “What am I uniquely capable of achieving for the business?” Last, it means completely changing daily priorities and a work schedule to focus on the new task at hand, the one thing the business needs next that the person can uniquely provide. It’s no small change. Often, the next problem is apparent and the transition is seamless, easy and logical. But sometimes, these transitions stress team builders enormously. Sometimes, they create crises of identity or confidence: I used to run this team; now what do I do? Sadly, sometimes it means finding work elsewhere. Despite the stresses created after the process is completed, managing yourself out of a job is a fine way of summarizing an ethos of team building. But we have to be prepared for the sometimes difficult transition to the next project after we’ve made ourselves redundant.

There’s a force in mobile app distribution that isn’t talked about much despite its magnitude: mobile social networks. Mobile social nets are becoming the predominant mobile app paid discovery/distribution platforms. How big is this force? Line, the Japanese mobile messenger with more than 200M users is on a $400M run rate , 60% of which is derived from app distribution. Kakao Talk will pay out about $600M to developers this year - which is about 10% of iTunes global developer payout in 2012. Remember, Kakao only serves Korea. Facebook’s mobile revenue will reach $2.5B this year driven by mobile CPI ads. In short, these networks are huge user funnels and money-making machines. To achieve this scale, these mobile social networks offer cost-effective customer acquisition by combining two network effects: user data aggregation and ad targeting data learning. In Line, Kakao Talk and Facebook, users sign up, create profiles and communicate. Their frequent brief sessions during the day create torrents of demographic, interest and behavior data for ad targeting. Additionally, as the user base grows so does the ad inventory and app downloaders for developers to target. Ad performance is the second data network effect. After a user clicks to download an application, his profile information and the app’s metadata (and sometimes usage data) are fed into a machine learning system that finds similar users and learns what works and what doesn’t. Additional ad performance data across a larger set of developers and app types compounds the effectiveness of the ad targeting system, reinforcing its superiority. These two data advantages enable mobile social networks to create the most cost effective paid mobile customer acquisition channels for startups.

There’s a concept in computer programming called operator overloading that neatly describes the current Series A investment market. Overloading means using the same code for two very different purposes depending on inputs. For example, a programmer could redefine the + function so that instead of adding two numbers, the function would multiply the numbers if one of the numbers was negative. Overloading can create lots of confusion in programming because the same function name can return very different results. The Series A market is overloaded. In my book, a Series A is the first round of financing with any single investor committing more than a $1M, typically led by an institutional investor. But everyone has a different definition. A company may define a Series A any way they like or even give it a different name: I’ve seen Series 1 or even Series Cool. But I digress. In the market today, three different types of Series A exist: the classic, the juiced and the jumbo. The Classic Series A is your father’s $3 to $5M round. The typical company has 3 to 7 employees, a product early in market with some data to support product market fit. The Juiced Series A ranges from $8 to $15M. Startups raising juiced Series As often have raised sizable seeds of $1.5M+, have teams approaching 20 people and have generated substantial market feedback. The check sizes resemble traditional Series B investments. The Jumbo Series A weighs in at $15 to $60M. Jumbo Series A startups tend to have been bootstrapped for quite a long time. The business is often well into revenue, roughly speaking about $10M+, and is raising its first institutional capital to grow faster and bolster the balance sheet before an IPO. Given the recent rise of the latter two species of Series A, one might be tempted to believe these rounds skew the financing market. Despite the substantially larger investment sizes, the NVCA data shows the average Series A investment hasn’t changed substantially since the end of the dot-com era at roughly $5M. Because the Series A definition is overloaded and because juiced and jumbo Series As create disproportionate press coverage, confusion about the state of the Series A market is inevitable. Looking past the terminology and into the data, today’s Series A market is no different than at any time over the past ten years.

How much should your SaaS startup spend on sales and marketing? I’ve written about using unit economics and lead funnel performance to answer this question. Emulating the patterns of successful SaaS companies is another technique. There are about 34 publicly traded SaaS companies that have published their revenue and sales & marketing expenses . Though their revenue growth rates are each unique, the sales and marketing spend patterns are quite similar. The revenue ramps of public SaaS companies follow the familiar exponential growth path. But their rates of growth vary quite a bit. Some companies' revenue ramps are more pronounced than others. LinkedIn is the most vertical of these, reaching nearly $1B of revenue in 10 years while Kenexa and Vocus needed 25 years to reach $200M-$300M in revenue. Despite these varied revenue trends, the sales and marketing spends as a fraction of revenue are remarkably similar. The chart below depicts Sales and Marketing Spend by Year / Revenue for each company. There seems to be a pattern. Running a smoothing algorithm over the data reveals the trend. In the first 3 years, these public SaaS companies spend between 80 to 120% of their revenue in sales and marketing (using venture dollars or other forms of capital to finance the business). By year 5, that ratio has fallen to about 50% where it remains for the life of the business. Despite the divergent revenue ramps, the marketing and sales spend patterns for these companies resemble each other strongly and serve as good benchmarks for high-growth SaaS startups. In case you’re curious, below is the “typical” revenue growth trajectory for these SaaS companies: $50M in year five, $100M in year ten. Notes on the analysis: Clearly, survivorship biases the data significantly. Small sample sizes (n=30) mean the variance in the data is high.

I’ve been promoting my Twitter account since October 2012 in effort to better understand social media content marketing and to promote that great vanity metric, Twitter follower count. At the outset, I promoted my account and links to blog posts. I prize followers more than one time visits to a blog, because the long term marketing relationship provides many chances to bring someone to my blog. Promoting links sends traffic to a single blog post, but doesn’t convert to followers with a very high rate. I spent $10 per day for 312 days and set my max bid to $2.5 per follower for people in the Bay Area. On average, I spent $9.28 per day to acquire 5.3 followers for an average cost-per-follower (CPF) of $1.73. Below is the detailed data: New followers are marked in gray and lost followers, those who unfollow me, are marked in red. On average, I gain 5 followers each day and lose 0.15 followers (that I paid to acquire). The unfollow rate has been increasing dramatically in the past few months from about 0.5% in February to 7.6% in August. This is a worrisome trend because it implies a decrease in targeting effectiveness and an increase in cost per follower (CPF). The number of impressions for my promoted account has increased by more than 5x since I started using the ads product in late 2012. This is a positive for me. The more people who see my name, the better, provided I don’t have to pay more. But it means that fewer ad impressions generate revenue for Twitter. Over the same time, the follow rate has improved by about 5x. Because the follower growth rate has remained relatively steady, the data implies that the number impressions required to garner a follower has increased by 5x in just a few months and Twitter is showing a greater number of impressions to the same users, rather than diffusing those impressions over many more users. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_38_809674251"> This chart confirms this trend. Darker dots indicate later months require more impressions to win a follower. Like all ad formats, the Twitter promoted follower ad unit suffers decreased performance over time as users become accustomed to it. Ultimately, these figures boil down to a cost to acquire a follower. The red line above is the smoothed gross cost to acquire a Twitter follower. Despite the spike in April, the cost has been decreasing steadily. The blue line, which is the cost net of the lost followers, has also been falling. The increasing number of impressions required to win a follower don’t factor into the CPF calculation thankfully. These lines are smoothed to show the trends. In future analyses, I’d like to measure the interaction rate of paid vs organic followers to determine the downstream value of these users. I suspect their retweet patterns differ quite substantially. Only with that data would it be possible to truly understand the marketing return on investment of Twitter ad spend. Overall, Twitter’s ad platform seems to be a great way of building a social media audience and if the estimated ROI for your content marketing campaign can justify a $1.50 cost per follower, then it’s well worth the investment.

Product and engineering teams are inseparable and at the core of most startups. One degree removed, sales and customer support teams ply the voice of the customer to influence product and eng. Of the five teams in a startup, marketing teams tend to have the least influence because traditional product marketers must influence others to enact change. Marketing works with product and engineering to update branding and communication within the product. Marketing collaborates with sales to refine the product positioning. Marketing relies on engineering to provide analysis for marketing spend efficiency, customer segmentation and user engagement. Marketing teams with customer support to ensure service reinforces the company’s brand. In each case, marketing is working through others. Sometimes, marketing speaks directly to customers through channels like blogs, events, paid advertising and public relations. Nevertheless, marketers mostly influence other teams to enact change. But that’s changing. We’re in the midst of marketing’s technical liberation when technology enables marketing teams to act directly, immediately and effectively. Technology is abstracting away many of the interactions between marketing and the other teams in a startup. This trend increases the influence and effectiveness of startup marketing teams. Mobile is the most immediate catalyst for this change. Marketers optimizing organic traffic through SEO are entirely dependent on engineering time to change the structure of the site or of the page. On the other hand, the iOS and Android store landing pages can be updated by a marketer with just a few clicks. Website optimization tools like Optimizely and Monetate among others enable marketers to test and refine pages through a point-and-click UI. A handful of startups are bringing these ideas to mobile applications as well. Marketing automation tools like Sailthru create dynamic segments of users on the fly to improve email response rates. Infer sifts through customer databases and uses machine learning to reduce churn and increase upsell. Dynamic creative optimization on Facebook and Google exchanges enable marketers to update ads dynamically. Tag management systems, both web and mobile, create simple tools for prioritizing ad networks. Looker and others enable marketers to sift through marketing and engagement data without needing the help of a data scientist or engineer. These technologies and others enable marketing to speak directly with the customer, change, test and tune. By empowering marketing teams with the data to make decisions and the tools to optimize their efforts, startups' marketing efficiency will see dramatic growth.

A team of founders who had just made their first their first hire asked me about culture and on boarding. How do they go about managing people? How do they maintain the values of the business? The underlying question of successful management is: How can founders lead and learn at the same time? I think a bastardized version Tolstoy’s well-worn refrain is apt: Happy teams are all alike; every unhappy team is unhappy in its own way. Anna Karenina on Startups After that conversation, I reflected on the culture at Google and why I thought it was great. These are the values I found there: Listening: the sine qua non of collaboration. Listen, absorb, reflect and respond. All communication starts with listening. Shared Learning: Some of us are experienced in one area. Others are learning from the first time. But we can all teach each other along the way and we must help each other particularly when chasing new ideas. Freedom to Whiff: Notice it’s not freedom to fail. Freedom to whiff means working in a team that allows you to take a big swing and miss. But the next time, you’d better hit the ball. Abject failure without subsequent success isn’t acceptable. Community Building: Caring about your people is the most fundamental part of management. Inquiring about their daily lives, lauding their successes, supporting them through their struggles. Employees aren’t resources; they’re people first and foremost. Obligation to Dissent: Peter Drucker wrote the story of Alfred Sloan, the former CEO of GM, who entered a board meeting to discuss an important issue before the company. Sloan asked the opinions of his directors. When everyone agreed without comment, he immediately stopped the board meeting and said something along the lines of, “Since we’re all in agreement, it’s clear no one has considered the issue. Let us reconvene tomorrow after giving the matter appropriate thought.” Empowering Leaders at Every Level: Leaders pull the organization forward toward big hairy audacious goals. But leaders don’t just exist at the C-level. Every team, every group, every project. Being a leader doesn’t mean knowing it all, but reinforcing the values above. What values do you believe let teams lead and learn at the same time?

For bloggers and content marketers, choosing the right content syndication tools to distribute posts is critical to developing an audience. The author/marketer must balance four attributes: distribution, measurement, retention and brand. Table 1: Balancing Syndication Tools Attributes Channel Distribution Measurement Retention Brand RSS Poor : only one subscriber Poor : volatile metrics Good but declining So so: controlled by RSS reader Email Poor : only one subscriber, double-opt in Poor : limited engagement stats Poor : Low unsubscribe rates; GMail filtering decreases visibliity Good : total control over UI Content Hubs Great : siphon site traffic, new readers Good : proprietary tools or GA Poor : often lacking follow or subscribe mechanisms Poor : limited control over UI Social Media Volatile : dependent on the audience but huge upside potential Great : use traditional web analytics plus follower data plus retweet So so: follower model creates 2 way relationship; no way to assure delivery Good : customize profile + traffic goes to website RSS’s end is nigh. Google shuttered Reader. Feedburner’s subscriber metrics of this blog swing by 50% or more. Plus the relationship between author and reader is one way (push). The email newsletter, currently in vogue, faces its own challenges. First, the new Google tabbed inbox relegates emailed posts to the tertiary Updates bucket. Second, email limits discoverability of other content on a site. Last, email curtails community participation and has its own measurement limitations created by pixel tracking. Content Hubs (Quora, Medium, Svbtle) generate huge amounts of traffic which can be siphoned, but retention of those users can be challenging because often follower models are missing or the culture of the sites tend to be episodic and content driven rather than individual or personality driven. I prefer writing here because Svbtle champions individuals and provides follower tools via Twitter. Social media (Facebook, Twitter) can drive huge amounts of traffic and create mechanisms for bidirectional communication but the acceptable content lengths are much shorter either because of hard constraints or cultural norms. Social media must be pared with a blogging platform of some kind. I’ve chosen to combine writing on a content hub (Svbtle) with social media distribution (Twitter, Quibb, Hacker News) because I think their strengths complement each other. About 1500 subscribe to this blog by RSS, but I think that number will dwindle with time. Another few hundred subscribe by email. Unfortunately, because of the poor measurement systems in place, it’s difficult to understand how to better serve the needs of those users. It’s much easier to gauge the reaction to content on social media than anywhere else. Every business will want to create a different type of relationship with its users and build its brand in a way true to their core values. Understanding the pros and cons of different syndication channels is key to that content marketing strategy.

Credit: Karl Scotland When I started at Redpoint in 2008, I wanted to find every way of analyzing companies I could. Consultants scrutinize the inner-workings of companies daily and create simple frameworks for explaining their operations. So I bugged a handful of friends with experience at the Big 3 consulting firms for their most used frameworks. Recently I came across an old friend, a framework I studied then called McKinsey’s Three Horizons in The Lean Entrepreneur , an anthology of lean startup techniques and case studies. The Three Horizons is a simple idea. Each project within a business follows an S-curve. At the beginning, the business must invest in the project, then if successful, the project grows and makes money, and last the project reaches maturity and declines. This is as true for startups as Fortune 50s. If a management team can take the profits from the first successful project and invest in the second project, during the height of the first project, then two S curves overlap, and again for a third. This this the idea behind the three horizons and the genesis of the chart above. For a business to prosper over many years, it must invest in more than one project or product. The management team will also want to diversify the company’s product portfolio. But, investing in all of them at the same time will diffuse the company’s focus and resources so sequencing the products becomes important. The Three Horizons helps to think through that sequencing. I’ve found the Three Horizons helpful in pitch meetings and board meetings to think through the evolution of a startup’s business. It helps me answer questions like: Which project should the company take on first? When should we start a second or third project? What is the ultimate vision for the business? Is the probability of success for the business conditional on the first product’s success or can the business succeed with the product from the second horizon? The Three Horizons is a fantastic strategic tool. I hope you can find some use for it at your startup.

Over the past few years, there has been a pronounced shift in the seed market. VCs now participate quite actively in the market. As a result, seed investment volumes have roughly doubled in the past year. But is the seed strategy working for startups and VCs? Do hugely successful businesses raise seed capital? Do those businesses include VCs in their seed rounds? And most importantly, do the VCs follow on in the Series A? To find the answer, I tabulated the early financing history for about 30 companies with $500M+ valuations (either private or public) founded in the past 8 years and sourced data from CapitalIQ and Crunchbase. What fraction of startups with recent billion dollar valuations or thereabouts raised a seed round? About 55%. What fraction of those seed rounds saw VC participation? 71%. In what share of cases did VCs in the seed round lead the Series A? 67%. To fully understand whether theses seed strategies work, we would need perfect information on total dollars invested in seed, the returns of those dollars, the cost of servicing the seed portfolio and opportunity cost of exploring investment elsewhere. But on the whole, investing in seeds seems to pay off handsomely for VCs, particularly if the seed investing program lands a big winner. Additionally, the seed investment does lead to a high follow on rate, though to get a better sense we would need to compare this metric to the follow on rate of less successful startups. Other interesting data points from the analysis: on average and of those billion dollar startups who raised a seed or A, the average seed round was $1M and the average Series A was $7.7M.

Over breakfast, I caught up with a close friend, an entrepreneur who is exploring a number of ideas for his next venture. He and his co-founder want to test their way to success with the Lean Startup Model. But they have added a twist to the Lean Startup process I call the Founder’s Null Hypothesis. Here’s how it works: First, this entrepreneur assumes each of his ideas will fail - the null hypothesis. Then, he and his co-founder write down a set of milestones or metrics that if achieved or proven would imply the idea is a good one. These tend to be quantitative customer feedback metrics. Next, the team allocates one to three weeks to achieve the milestones they created. If the team achieves them, they pursue the idea. The team assumes the burden of proof to show an opportunity exists and is worthwhile before writing a line of code. This approach reminded me of an idea from statistics, the null hypothesis which is a technique for defeating confirmation bias , eloquently described by Francis Bacon: “The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to support and agree with it.” It’s easy to fall in love with an idea and create a thousand reasons why it might succeed. But that feeling could be confirmation bias. On the other hand, if a team assumes all ideas will fail, creates a target for disproving that the idea will fail and exceeds those goals, the team can make a measured and rational decision about which idea to pursue.

Big data technologies like Hadoop, HBase, Redshift, Vertica and others store ever greater quantities of data. As the capacity to store this data increases, so does the importance of extracting value and insight from it. Big data adoption is a four step process : generate data, store data, hire specialists to analyze the data, and finally democratize data exploration. Today, businesses lack great data exploration tools. Looker has built those tools. Two hours before a meeting with the Looker team, I sent them a sizable data set. During the pitch, Lloyd Tab, Looker’s founder, grouped, pivoted and drilled into the data. He said to me, “I’ve bet you’ve never really understood your data before I showed it to you on Looker.” And I agreed with him. Looker is the tool to drive the critical last step of big data adoption. Looker enables anyone within an organization to ask and answer questions of their company’s data. That’s why we invested. It’s rare for us to hear as persistent a refrain as the excitement among Looker’s customers, especially at such an early stage.  From a portfolio company which exclusively powers its operations-heavy business on Looker, to a travel company whose sales team adopted the product and became profitable overnight, Looker customers consistently operate their businesses more effectively with Looker. The team at Looker, especially Frank Bien and Lloyd Tab, have deep domain expertise. They worked through data challenges at LiveOps and Greenplum.  Distilled from those experiences, Looker’s product enables companies to model, explore and explain data to make better decisions. New database technologies underpin Looker’s product. As Lloyd eloquently wrote in “Business Intelligence and the Elephant’s Chain,” innovations in MPP relational databases, SQL interfaces to non-relational data stores and exponential growth in computational power enable Looker’s infinite resolution business intelligence. We are excited to partner with the Looker team and help catalyze the democratization of data exploration.

Cohort analysis provides deep insight into customer bases because cohorts expose how customer accounts grow, evolve and churn. Plus, cohort analysis provides a framework to evaluate product releases, marketing pushes and advertising campaign performance. The Six Cohort Reports I Use to Understand Trends Below is a list of the six reports I create when analyzing cohorts. The combination of these six reports provides a robust summary of the state of a customer base. By no means exhaustive, this collection is a solid starting point and of course these are framed in the context of revenue but could easily be changed to activity or another metric. Average Revenue Per Customer Over Time - Chart monthly revenue over time to contrast with cohort data Individual Account Growth Over Time - Chart all accounts to visualize trends. Typical Account Growth Over Time - Chart how the average account grows with time Number of Customers in Each Cohort - Chart number of customers in each cohort to see how sensitive cohort data is to sample size and also see the size of the new customer pipeline over time. Average Monthly Revenue By Cohort - Chart the revenue by cohort to see if newer customers generate more or less revenue than older customers. Really good for marketing spend evaluation. Cohort Comparison - Chart the different cohorts over time to see how their revenue characteristics compare. Implementation in R Cohort analysis is difficult to perform in a database or in Excel so I turned to R . Below is a generic cohort analysis script for R, the open source statistical language. I use two libraries by Hadley Wickham , plyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for plotting the data. Hadley is at the forefront of R and an extraordinary contributor to the community. I can’t overstate his impact on the way I use R. I seem to use only standard libraries and Hadley’s. To use this data analysis, start with a file with 3 columns: “date” column (YYYY-MM-DD), “company_name” column, monthly revenue “revenue”. If your file isn’t in this format, use Hadley’s reshape library to “melt” the data. Note: I use tab-separated files but you could easily use a CSV. If you have ideas for improving the script or if you’ve found a bug, send me a note using the email link on the left. ### IMPORT LIBRARIES ###

Control4’s IPO last week and Nest’s massive success mark the beginning of mainstream, useful connected devices. In the decade to come, the most successful will be united by one common characteristic. They will anticipate our needs and make us lazier. Living is hard work. So many things to remember, like buying milk on the way home tonight. Plenty of software has been written to help us manage our daily torrent of to dos. In fact, there is a fine app for Remembering the Milk . But it has one flaw. I still have to remember to Remember the Milk. Instead, I’d prefer to worry less. Wouldn’t you? I’d like the milk (not me) to remember to arrive fresh before I pour a bowl of GrapeNuts at 7am on Monday. I’d prefer not to remember to turn the air conditioning down, lock the front door of my house, feed a pet, pause the sprinklers after rain, type in today’s workout into the treadmill or order a milk delivery. This is anticipatory computing. When technology anticipates our needs and acts accordingly, we will have achieved that zenith of laziness. We will be liberated from the tyranny of to dos. We’re on the precipice of large scale anticipatory computing. Google Now predicts my destination and informs me of the traffic conditions using sensors in my phone and behavior recorded in software. Nest intelligently manages climate in houses. Lockitron secures homes. These products seamlessly blend hardware sensors and software learning to create magic. Over the next few years, many more anticipatory computing startups will solve problems for consumers and achieve huge success. I can’t wait to forget about all those things I have to remember to do.

I never thought learning how to write better might help me understand product design but it has. Great literature and well designed products share one defining attribute: they create a telepathic connection between the creator and the consumer. Before you chuckle and write me off as a palm reading gypsy, hear me out. The idea isn’t mine, but Stephen King’s. Over the weekend, I read King’s blunt and inspirational autobiographical narrative, “On Writing.” In this book, Stephen King accomplishes two things. First, he tells the story of his struggles to become a successful author. Second, he explains all the tools he used to accomplish his goal. In quite a few ways Stephen King’s path to literary success parallels many entrepreneurs. His journey consisted of a modest upbringing, a supportive parent and encouraging mentors, and an unbridled work ethic and passion to pursue his talent which led ultimately to many best sellers and critical acclaim. While King’s story is impressive, his description of writing is more compelling. At the heart of writing, King writes, is telepathy. The best writing conveys the thoughts of the author precisely to the reader who may be thousands of miles away or living a decade later. Despite their separation, both minds see the same images. Great products evoke the same telepathy. The first time I used a Mac and it “just worked,” I felt a connection. The product designer had suffered the same software frustrations as I had, and solved the problem in a way that made sense to both of us, and millions more. Well designed products feel human because empathy underpins their design. Like works of literature, great products create a link between a product designer and a user. The product designer has an idea, an image, of how to solve a problem and the user, faced with the product, understands immediately the designer’s mind set and solution. The simple elegance of timeless writing and skillful product design are one in the same. They are the embodiment of a connection between author and reader/designer and user.

As I wrote about in a post on aligning founder and VC incentives , it’s important for entrepreneurs to understand their own ambitions and the ambitions of investors. The most important part of that is understanding the financial motivations and the dynamics of the industry VCs face. Typically, VCs adopt primarily one of three strategies with a fund [1]: Small fund , small ownership positions, many investments in markets that will consistently generate sub-$100M acquisitions. Medium fund , sizable ownership positions, a moderate number of investments in markets that will occasionally generate $150M to $800M acquisitions. Large fund , moderate ownership positions, a moderate number of investments that will consistently generate $1B+ acquisitions. I’m going to use CBInsights' 2012 Private Technology Company M&A Data data to demonstrate why VCs adopt these three strategies. Exit Distribution Below is the chart showing the number of private technology company acquisitions of various sizes ranging from $0 to $1.2B. As you might expect, 53% of acquisitions by number are sub-$50M and the $1B+ transactions generate 19% of the proceeds. Another Perspective on the Data: Quartiles But let’s look at the estimated proceeds in another way, by quartile. Each of the four outcome buckets below generated the same amount of return to investors[5], about $11B in 2012. Obviously, the left-most bucket requires many more acquisitions than the right-most bucket to achieve the same result, but there are twenty-one times fewer $1B exits than sub-$50M exits so the odds of investing in those billion dollar winners are much slimmer. Pick your poison. Matching a Fund to a Quartile Given it is possible to generate the same gross returns in each quartile, it is theoretically possible to construct four different portfolios with four different strategies and each generate the same returns. Let’s look at those portfolios: Fund Small Fund Early Fund Blended Fund Growth Fund Target Quartile 1 / $150M 2 / $400M 3 / $800M 4 / $1200M Avg 2012 Exit[4] 45 239 527 1005 Fund Size 75 250 400 1000 Avg Investment 1 5 10 25 Investments 75 50 40 40 Target Return 3 3 3 3 Ownership 10% 25% 20% 15% M&A/IPO Ratio [2] 70% 70% 70% 70% Gross Proceeds to Achieve Multiple 225 750 1200 3000 M&A Market Cap Required 1575 2100 4200 14000 Number of Exits Required 35 9 8 14 Investment Success Rate Required 47% 18% 20% 35% Assuming each fund pursues a pure strategy of targeting exits within their quartile [1], the small fund will make 75 investments of which 47% must be sold at an average of $45M. The Early Fund must invest in 50 companies and sell 9 of those for $250M each. The Blended Fund must invest in 40 companies and sell 8 for $527M each and the Growth Fund must invest in 40 companies and sell 14 at $1B each. Each of these hypothetical funds would generate a 3x for their investors. In summary, small funds tend to make many bets and aim for high success rates. Medium funds are able to accept close to half of the failure rate of a pure strategy small fund while the hypothetical growth fund takes a smaller amount of risk. The Relationship Between Risk and Ownership Targets Not coincidentally, the ownership percentages typical are inversely proportional to risk tolerance. The greater the acceptable failure rate, the more important ownership becomes, because the winners must cover a fund’s losses. There are many different ways of constructing a fund’s strategy and those strategies vary with the risk tolerances of the individuals raising the fund, innovation cycles and financial market cycles. But at the core of the venture business are these three fundamental investment strategies. Notes The data I use here are all estimates because I don’t have access to CBInsights source data. I removed the Facebook IPO from calculations because of its disproportionate and skewing effect on the data. [1] VCs often blend these strategies in portfolio construction. Every investor aspires to a $1B+ exit. But, to simplify the analysis, I’m assuming funds pursue only a single strategy. And of course no investor has perfect knowledge of the ultimate acquisition price of a business, but instead uses market size, public company multiples and other data to form a proxied estimate for that value.

How should a successful marketing initiative for a startup operate? It’s possible to jump right into performance marketing immediately after launch, optimizing conversion funnels and squeezing every cent out of ad spend. But I think there’s an important step that precedes performance marketing: community development. Yesterday, I met with an entrepreneur who was researching how best to build a marketing team for her business. After having spoken to many other founders, she decided to prioritize community management before traditional marketing. She wanted to build a community of people who she could educate about her product, who would use it and become vocal champions. Later that afternoon, a friend mentioned a recent TED talk by Derek Sivers on how to start a movement . In the video embedded below, Sivers speaks while a video of a man dancing in a park plays behind him and a dance mob slowly builds. Sivers highlights the importance of the first man, but extols the tremendous value the next five or so people who dance and bring their friends. Those first believers ally their tribes to the idea, which forms an avalanche of support. TED Talk on How to Start a Movement In both the entrepreneur’s case and the dancer’s case, the key to success is building a community of reference users and evangelists who compound the word of mouth initiatives. Another entrepreneur once wrote to me “marketing is intelligent engagement.” I think that’s the essence of community management - aggregating and cultivating a group of people passionate about your cause or your product. It’s all about building social proof to reinforce your sales process. ZenDesk, among many others, adopted this strategy. By engaging the customer support community, they were able to grow their business incredibly quickly. Layering on performance marketing or sales after establishing a substantial community of advocates dramatically improved the effectiveness of those awareness campaigns. Potential customers would ask current customers and be persuaded to adopt the product by the community. The idea of starting a startup’s marketing initiative with community management isn’t a novel one. But it can be a powerful first step in building momentum for a business. I’ve written two other related posts on marketing, engagement and community: Debunking the myths of Social, Viral and Community What SaaS businesses can Learn from Newspapers About Community

From time to time, entrepreneurs ask one investor for referrals to other investors. After all, investors network frequently, work together and have long term relationships with each other so a referral should go a long way. But not all introductions are equal. The most successful investor-to-investor referrals are those where the referring investor is investing in the business and is seeking to fill out the round with complementary capital. By investing, the referring investor sends a strong signal to others about his/her excitement about the company. This happens most often in seed rounds but also occurs in Series A, B and later. The next most successful referrals are sent by an investor with expertise in a category who is precluded from investing in a company for some reason but is enthusiastic about the business. Most often, the investor is blocked because a portfolio company is potentially competitive with the startup. The most challenging referrals are those where the referring investor is not committed to investing or hasn’t decided to invest. These kinds of referrals introduce some ambiguous signaling. Why would a potentially competing investor refer me to an investment opportunity he didn’t pursue? It’s an adverse selection issue. These dynamics resemble hiring referral dynamics. The most successful candidate referrals are those from someone who has worked with the candidate in the past and would hire them, but can’t for an unrelated externality (no hiring budget, role already filled within the company, etc). Investor to investor referrals can be powerful tools for startups. But as with any tool, it’s important to think about how to implement the tool to maximize success.

Crowdfunding platforms solve three key problems for startups, two of which are obvious. Kickstarter and Indiegogo, among others validate demand and provide short term financing by marketing product ideas and accepting pre-payment for future delivery. Consumers vote with their dollars to catalyze product development. The third, less obvious benefit, is the platforms cajole startups to follow a product management process similar to Amazon’s process, described below by Ian McAllister in his Quora post What Is Amazon’s Product Management Process? For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product’s customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions. It is easy to draw a parallel between the Amazon press releases and the project pages on Kickstarter : Here’s an example outline for Amazon’s internal press release: Heading - Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. Sub-Heading - Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. Summary - Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. Problem - Describe the problem your product solves. Solution - Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. Quote from You - A quote from a spokesperson in your company. How to Get Started - Describe how easy it is to get started. Customer Quote - Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. Closing and Call to Action - Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. Amazon’s product management philosophy champions the idea of working backwards, something I’ve written about in the past . By initially focusing on the value proposition, features and positioning to maximize future customer demand, Amazon’s product teams should be consistently delivering products that delight customers. Crowdfunding sites take this idea one step further than Amazon’s process by enabling product teams to truly measure demand after having written the press release. These platforms are some of the best customer development and market research tools available to product teams because they enforce a product management discipline and then empower the product teams to refine and distill an idea, prove market demand, and use this data to potentially raise external capital to get to market.

In 2005, I started as a customer support rep in the AdSense team at Google. Over the next few months, I was trained in the art of handling hundreds of emails per day. My training focused on using a customer service tool called Trakken that Google had acquired and heavily modified to enable AdWords and AdSense teams to manage the torrent of inbound support emails from customers. In AdSense, a team of fewer than 100 people supported a few hundred thousand customers almost exclusively through email with customer satisfaction scores consistently above 90%. Trakken’s power rested in three key features. First, the ability to collaborate on emails/tickets. We could pass problems around to the right subject matter expert. Because the tickets were tracked, the status of those emails was known to everyone within Google. Emails didn’t get lost. Second, the functionality to bulk respond or respond with customized canned responses enabled scalability. We memorized a few hundred five letter keyboard shortcuts that inserted standard text we would customize for each ticket. Third, the metrics to track our response times motivated better than 24h turn around time. We would routinely identify bottlenecks in response time and quash them. Leaving the support organization and working with “standard” email left me yearning for Trakken. As time goes by, the number of emails in my work inbox approaches the same volumes as support tickets I used to manage. But Gmail and Outlook and Sparrow haven’t really evolved to help us manage the deluge of messages. I’ve cobbled together a few solutions in order to replicate some of the same functionality with a handful of Chrome Extensions and lightweight Mac apps. But I’m seriously considering moving my work email to Zendesk, a full customer support system because of my experience with Trakken. Email isn’t going anywhere and I want to be able to answer each email in less than 24h. Each year the average user receives 2000 more emails than the previous year , making this goal ever more challenging. The current generation of tools clearly were designed to handle such volume. I think the next evolution of work email will look very much like a customer support tool: collaboration, macros/automated responses and metrics tracking. It’s the only way I see to manage the ever growing inbox.

Sales pitches ought to frame a product in a way to maximize the chances of success of a sale. One trend I’ve been seeing in pitches is to talk about how software can save costs by reducing a customer’s head count. A pitch that focuses on cost savings by reducing staff should be delivered only after much consideration because of a few objections created in these pitches that might slow or halt the sales process. First, the pitch immediately provokes opponents to the sale. Suddenly, someone must rationalize a paycheck and compete with the software for the job. Opponents within potential customers complicate the sales process. Second, framing the pitch this way caps the customer’s willingness to pay at the value an employee’s salary, limiting the maximum account size. Third, the pitch creates an unnecessary either/or decision: a customer should choose either the software or the staff member. Forcing a staffing decision before a purchase decision slows down the sales process dramatically. The alternative to pitching a product as a staff-based cost savings is to pitch the product as a tool which empower employees to become more productive or efficient. This tactic mitigates the three objections above. The pricing plan can be value based (charge a fraction of the surplus created for the customer) instead of cost-based (capped an employee’s salary). Fewer opponents to the sale are created and the purchasing decision can be made with need to consider internal staffing or policy. Every sales pitch is different. But being mindful of how to frame a pitch to align incentives and enable strong account growth is important to long term success.

Atul Gawande, the American surgeon known for his book “ Better ”, wrote an article in this week’s New Yorker called “ Slow Ideas: Some innovations spread fast. How do you speed the ones that don’t? ” He describes the challenges faced by healthcare institutions all over the world: despite the advances in research, the most difficult part of improving care isn’t availing doctors and nurses to these breakthroughs, but changing their behavior. Some doctors simply won’t wash their hands no matter how many times they are told it reduces infection rates. While the stakes in technology adoption are less dire, changing user behavior is just as challenging for information workers as doctors. Startups may research the market, understand customer use cases, solve the users’ problems on paper, but unless they change behavior, their efforts are no more useful than the healthcare research trapped in a doctor’s file cabinet or email inbox. Insights and tools must be put to use. That’s why I think there ought to be an additional step in the Product Market Fit process, the image at the top of the page. This step begins after Customer Validation and before the scaling of the sales and marketing teams in Customer Creation. This step should be called Customer Engagement. The goal of this step is to develop a process to drive product adoption and behavior change within an organization. As Gawande writes: To create new norms, you have to understand people’s existing norms and barriers to change. You have to understand what’s getting in their way. Eliminating obstacles to change and understanding how to motivate new users to adopt the tool repeatably are essential to deploying a product. The current PMF framework emphasizes finding value proposition fit with each customer segment and then optimizing sales efficiency. But sales without engagement leads to high churn and the mirage of product market fit that will vanish when it’s time to renew customer contracts. Understanding customer needs and building the product to solve those needs are critical. But so is developing a process to destroy the inertia of doing things “the old fashioned way” and catalyze users to change their workflows to enact change. That’s the only way to speed the adoption of change, whether in medicine or in technology. Understanding customer needs and building the product to solve those needs are critical. But so is developing a process to destroy the inertia of doing things “the old fashioned way” and catalyze users to change their workflows to enact change. That’s the only way to speed the adoption of change, whether in medicine or in technology.

This week, I visited a startup whose office had a very unusual feature: a usability lab. There I was in a soundproofed room with a table in the center flanked by two chairs, one for a user and one product manager or UX researcher. On the table, a constellation of web cams record a user’s facial expressions and interactions with a mobile phone or laptop while a microphone captures the user’s voice. It had been years since I had been in a similar room at Google, where usability studies are more or less required for major product releases. We would invite five users at a time to visit us periodically over the development of the product. We asked each visitor in turn to sit down and begin using the new product or feature all the while speaking their thoughts. At the beginning and the end of the project, we wouldn’t intervene, but watch the user’s first experience in silence with great interest. Other times, we focused the user on a particular element of the product by asking them to perform a task or asked pointed questions about the design of an input table or a workflow. The results of the studies always confounded me. Users would stumble through “simple” parts of the product and point out weirdnesses we thought would be accepted as universal design affordances. But that was the point: to invalidate our assumptions and find the points of friction in the product. Stepping out of the startup’s usability lab, I left wondering why labs aren’t more common in post-Series A companies and incubators - and why I hadn’t suggested the idea to the entrepreneurs I work with. Despite the work required to find and study users during our product work at Google, the effort always yielded a handful of key insights we might not have discovered otherwise. It is a stroke of genius on the part of this startup to dedicate a part of their office to the study of the use of their product in users' hands. After all, that is the most important part of product design: understanding the user.

Earlier this week, I met an experienced head of sales. During our meeting, the candidate shared a simple way of thinking about a startup’s sales process that resonated with me. A startup’s sales evolution contains three phases: beta, reference customer, ROI calculator. Beta :
A founder of the startup develops relationships with a handful of customers who will work in tandem with the company to design, tune and improve the product. Typically, beta customers use the software for free or at heavily discounted rates. These customers benefit by disproportionately influencing product development. Reference Customers : The goal of the beta is to cultivate a handful of reference customers, product champions passionate enough about the startup’s product to take calls from potential clients and sing praises about the product. Of course, more customers using the product means the startup can continue to improve the product and support it - a benefit for the beta customers. The ROI Calculator : Reference customers' testimonials and case studies should be leveraged to build a larger sales pipeline of potential customers. Some teams stop here, but the sales evolution isn’t complete. The last step is to create a return on investment calculator for each customer segment. The ROI calculator estimates the value creation by a startup’s product based on existing customer data. Building this calculator takes time and thought. First, many customers must adopt the product, use the product and then measure their ROI. But it’s worth the effort. Quantitative estimates of the ROI based on customer data are powerful tools in sales meetings - and particularly if this quantitative argument complements the qualitative social proof provided by reference customers. A startup is a machine designed to forge predictability from chaos. A critical part of that predictability is consistent sales execution and that means evolving the sales process. Like all frameworks, this three step process isn't for every business. But it’s a solid, high level plan for a sales team.

With more than 80% of venture capital investments occurring in enterprise and with the public markets disproportionately rewarding SaaS companies with huge enterprise value-to-revenue multiples ( median is 7.6 ), it’s no surprise that interest Software-as-a-Service is booming. After meeting quite a few SaaS companies, I’ve compiled a list of my ideal characteristics for a SaaS business below. Characteristic 1: Product Is Core to the Operation of the Business The product is essential to the operation of a customer’s business. For example, Zuora enables subscription billing; Expensify manages employee expenses; ZenDesk builds customer support systems. Customers can’t function without it. Characteristic 2: Cost/Value Proposition is Straightforward The product is either cheaper than the alternative: hiring an engineering team to build and maintain a custom implementation of the product; Or provides network effect benefits otherwise impossible to find: LinkedIn’s network effects drive the adoption of LinkedIn’s applicant tracking system; Or offers sophisticated technology that is difficult to replicate: Infer builds machine learning models on top of sales data to improve company performance. Not every company has ML expertise. Characteristic 3: Finances Its Own Growth The company benefits from negative working capital and shorter time-to-market. Negative working capital means customers pay at the beginning of a month or quarter or year to use the product. These customers pay to improve the software over time by providing cash up front, reducing the cash needs of the business. Because customers are paying to improve the product, rather than buying a “production-ready” enterprise product, the company can go to market much earlier in their development. At the outset, the company targets the less sophisticated SMB segment which doesn’t demand the compliance, heavy security and integration features needed by enterprise customers. This also decreasing time to market and provides revenues and product feedback in the short term. Characteristic 4: Efficient Sales Model The company is able to recoup its cost of customer acquisition, be it online marketing or inside/outside sales, in less than a year. Ideally, the company offers 12 month contracts and the company can be profitable on a customer before the customer has an option to churn. Hand-in-hand with this idea is strong customer retention. Characteristic 5: Market Leadership The company is already a market leader, is on the path to becoming the market leader, or is operating in a segment with little viable competition. In SaaS, sales and marketing execution are critical to the success of the business. Competition increases customer acquisition costs and increases sales complexity. SaaS companies can be hugely valuable and for good reason: their products are core to their customers' businesses, offer something which is unique in the market (cheaper, better), finance their own growth through efficient sales models and ideally establish market leadership.

More and more companies realize their proprietary data contains insights that drive tremendous competitive advantage. Enabling an organization to make data driven decisions is a long term process. Below is the current big data adoption process and where we are within it: Companies generate proprietary data whose volumes can’t be handled by existing tools. The main adopters of these technologies are financial services, healthcare, genomics and web companies. Companies build or buying the tools and expertise to store and process that data. Major vendors include Cloudera, MapR, HortonWorks, Splunk, GoodData, Vertica, Greenplum and many others. These new tools demand new skill sets within the organization: data storage expertise, data processing acumen, analytical ability, modeling skills, visualization expertise.  As the infrastructure to support data analysis matures, data scientists become the bottleneck within the organization as they are beseiged by data questions. Tools emerge to enable analysis at edges of the organization so sales, marketing, product and everyone else can perform the analysis without having to submit a request to the data science team. While the ecosystem is quite young and there will be innovation at every step in the process above, the next wave of innovation in the data science market will occur in the last stage of the process above: the democratization of data analysis.

I once read a book by Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist researching decision-making from USC, about a man who had lost the capacity to feel emotions after he was struck by lightning. Much to my surprise, his man was totally incapable of making decisions. His cognitive ability, the capacity to process and analyze data, remained fully intact. He could articulate the pros and cons of every alternative to each decision. His logical ability was flawless.  But, he never could decide on an option. There’s something indescribable about the decision to start a company; it’s  frustrating to explain to someone else who doubts your decision. You can rationalize it and list the pros and cons, but ultimately it’s the emotional commitment to a vision or to a team that drives us to make the leap. And what a thrill irrationality is.

We’re already seeing the impact to hardware vendors of peak smart phone. Over the past six months, Apple, Samsung and HTC share prices have fallen 20 to 25% . These share prices have tumbled because smart phone penetration is hurtling towards 70% in the US . True saturation has occurred in certain segments: 87% of 30 to 49 year olds with income greater than $75k own a smart phone. Does the app economy suffer from the same challenge of decreasing growth as hardware? Yes, it does. Below is a chart depicting iOS app download patterns by users over time. The average number of apps downloaded per month and lifetime downloads have remained flat over the past four years and may even be declining. This data supports the conclusion that smart phone user demand for apps is linear. This means the total monthly app download volume in the US should be about 800M apps (330M people x 2.4 app downloads per month). We haven’t reached this point of saturation in any market yet. This year, only six countries will exceed 50% smart phone penetration according to eMarketer. But given the growth rates of phone sales, peak smartphone should be upon us in the next 18 to 36 months. When we do hit peak smart phone penetration, how might the app store dynamics change? It’s hard to know before it happens but here are a few thoughts. Limited demand for applications should increase the average cost per install. This will drive developers to pursue apps with increasing monetization to support higher costs of acquisition. We will have maturity in utility categories like email clients, phone clients, web browsers; some turnover in social networks; most turnover in games. Utilities tend to be downloaded by new users and infrequently replaced. But gamers swap out the next platformer as soon as they are bored. Decreasing attractiveness of the marginal smart phone user in terms of ARPUU. New smart phone users will increasingly live outside of the most developed markets. It’s too early to tell what the fuller impact of peak smart phone might be, but at least in the US, it could be around the corner. A note about the data:
I calculated this data by first finding app store and iOS sales figures for each year from Apple. I then assumed the total number of active devices in a period was about half of the preceding period (smartphone replacement cycles are 22.4 months) and then divided the app downloads by those active devices. Full data is published here

One of my favorite courses in engineering grad school was Marketing which was taught by a brilliant quirky professor. On the first day of class our professor wrote on the board this equation: Innovation = Invention + Marketing Addressing a group of engineers who prided themselves on their technical skills, this professor of marketing tried to instill in us that invention alone isn’t enough to create innovation. The invention has to be coupled with a way of understanding the customer, speaking to that customer, educating the customer and ultimately convincing the customer to adopt the invention. Only when the customer base has adopted the invention at scale have we truly innovated. Aside from customer development, the other the most important component of marketing is timing. Sometimes even the best inventions coupled with fantastic marketing still don’t achieve innovation. Because the market simply isn’t ready for them. It’s not infrequently in the Valley that you might hear, “We built [insert successful company name here] three years before. We were just a little too early.” Timing the market is one of the most difficult things to do. Sometimes entrepreneurs fall into the right place at the right time with the right idea. Other times, they might need a few years working within an industry for to understand the long-term trends of a customer or user base and the opportunities the industry affords. And then there are the exceptions, entrepreneurs clearly have a knack for market timing. Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, David Sacks are all repeat entrepreneurs who have had success in several industries. If I were to update the professor’s equation, I would write: Innovation = Invention + Marketing + Timing

It is easy to write off content marketing as a waste of time. Effectiveness is difficult to measure; it is time consuming and the payback period on the investment is uncertain. But unlike most forms of paid marketing, content marketing has a cumulative and compounding return. Each of the posts of a blog continues to attract traffic from SEO and social channels long after it has been published. Below is a chart of the 9 most popular posts in the last 12 month on this blog. It is scaled to eliminate the peaks to better show how page views on these posts trend with time. There is a pattern of a huge spike on the first day of publication, followed by a tail of steady and consistent visits. This data underscores the persistent, compounding benefits of content. The corollary is the larger a content base, the greater the traffic, because of the sum of the visitors to the older posts. More interesting though, is the share of total page views of each post generated on the first day of publication. Across these nine posts, there is a huge range: 4 to 86%. The average is about 41%, meaning more than half of the page views on a top blog post occur one or more days after the post was published. The net result for this blog has been a steady growth in visitors. I measure two different growth rates for the blog: the growth rate of the core readership and the growth rate of the spikes (when a post become interesting to a larger group). Below is the daily page view count for this blog over the last 12 month. The core readership visits have grown by 8% each month. Meanwhile, the readership from spikes has grown by 10% each month. Attributing the growth rate to any one particular driver is foolish. But I suspect the increasing size of the content library attracts readers, who may then subscribe via RSS or email, and then share the content on social networks. The source traffic data do support this theory. Below is the chart depicting the share of visits by traffic source. More than half of all traffic is direct, RSS and email - the core readership. Social generates a bit more than a third, and it is clear that the social sharing reactivates interest in older content up to 10 times as frequently as search. This is why reblogging older posts, or content recycling, can be so effective in social media. Maintaining a drumbeat of content creation requires discipline and persistence. But the compounding benefits of creating this library can drive sustained growth and awareness of your product, brand and company. If you would like to perform this analysis on your content, I recommend using the Google Analytics developer tool found here . It provides API access to your Analytics account. To generate the data for the longitudinal analysis, type in ga:pagePath for the dimensions and ga:pageviews in the metric and output the data to Excel. Subscribe to this blog via email

I started playing around with Google’s programming language called Go yesterday. There’s a tour of the language found here .  Clearly, Go has been designed by a group of incredibly smart people and makes a series of terrific design decisions that enable a tremendous amount of flexibility and performance while reducing the amount of code an engineer has to write. But after spending about 90 minutes running through the tutorial, I decided to throw in the towel. It’s easy to become accustomed to a particular way of doing things. I’m familiar with the Ruby community, the libraries, the development environment and some the intricacies of the language. So it’s difficult to change all of that in the pursuit of some yet unknown gains. Potential customers perform this calculus when evaluating technologies every day. Do I continue to use the technologies with which I’m most familiar? Or is the benefit of a new technology, net of its adoption costs, worth the learning curve? Each sales pitch is an effort to convince the potential customer to change their behavior. Changing behavior isn’t an easy thing to do. It all starts with motivation triggered by a comparison between what I am doing and what I ought to be doing. To win customers, maximize that difference - or at least the perception of that difference.

I’m asked with some frequency which startup sectors are booming. Mobile messaging and big data are knee-jerk reactions at this point.  But these days I often respond “financial services.” In the last two years, financial services startups have been innovating impressively quickly and challenging some of the fundamental ways in which capital and credit are distributed. I count seven major categories of innovation to date: Math Based Currencies/Payment Networks - Bitcoin might be the most well-known and best publicized math-based currency, but there are a handful of others in the market, like OpenCoin and LiteCoin. Math-based currencies are novel ways of enabling instant settlements, low cost transactions and foreign exchanges.  The promise of these startups is to create new payment networks and more efficient ways of transferring value. Consumer Credit -  After the crash of 2008, bank lending collapsed. This created the opportunity for new forms of consumer lending like peer-to-peer lending championed by Prosper, Lending Club and many others.  These services offer consumers credit at better than market rates, while offering investors rates of return exceeding the public equity or bond markets. The next wave of innovation in consumer credit seems to be the use of social signals as determinants of creditworthiness. SMB capital access -  In addition to consumers' feeling the tightening of the credit market, small and medium businesses suffered as local and regional banks' pursestrings contracted in tandem. Companies including Capital Access Network, Kyriba, The Receivables Exchange, Biz2Credit, C2FO, Axial and others provide access to capital at scale to these enterprises. Similar in nature to innovations in consumer credit, startups providing loans to small and medium businesses aggregate investor capital seeking higher returns than  can be had in the public markets and lend to businesses at lower than market rates. Mobile first banking - The Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank Bill regulated interchange fees, reducing the profits payments companies generate on credit card swipes. This is a boon to merchants whose payment fees shrank. But payment providers sought new lines of revenue to replace what had been legislated away. Banks have resorted to charging greater fees on checking and savings accounts and imposing additional fees on consumers for overdraft charges. There to seize the opportunity are startups like Simple and MovenBank which look to become mobile first banks, reducing operating costs by eliminating the need for ATMs and physical presences. POS reinvention -  Retailers are reaping the rewards of the reinvention of the point-of-sale terminal for retailers. Apple, Square, PayPal, Revel, Erply and others have built portable, inexpensive touchscreen-based point-of-sale systems on by iPad and tablets that offer a better customer experience and a lower cost of ownership than the systems Micros and NCR can offer. Crowdfunding - Kickstarter and Indiegogo have led the crowd funding wave. An alternate form of loan, crowdfunding is being used for everything from financing vacations to hardware development. These services enable customers to vote with their dollars and support projects of all different shapes and sizes. Social networks' distribution enables fundraisers to find “investors” who share their interests. Developer payment platforms - Companies like Stripe, Braintree and Balanced are dramatically simplifying the  developer experience when integrating payments into web and mobile products.  By reducing the time to market and the complexity of payments integration, these companies enable many more businesses to charge for goods and services on the web. Financial services innovations like these have the capacity to profoundly change the way we do business because they reduce transaction costs, making commerce of every kind easier and smoother. It is breathtaking to watch the pace and the magnitude of change.

At about 11pm on a Tuesday night in 2006, I began coding a skeleton CRM web app for our internal use at Google called Toothpaste that tracked the key details of our larger inside sales customers. It was my first real Rails project after spending quite some coding Java.  After I ran “rails server”, I watched the terminal as the program spit out a few lines from the built in app server, Webbrick, and refreshed my browser to see the Ruby on Rails Welcome page.  Within a few hours, the first version was functionally complete and I went to bed excited by the prospect of demo'ing what I had built. Having worked with Java and other languages, I was dazzled by the speed of development of Ruby on Rails. It seemed to take only 10% of the time that a Java web app might. In addition, I benefitted enormously from the huge free library of free components called gems that enable in-line editing, easy access to databases, etc, built by the community. Since then, I’ve tried to keep up-to-date with the myriad coding innovations: new databases (Hadoop, Mongo, Spark, TAO), new web frameworks (Node, Angular, Meteor) and new languages (Go, Clojure). Infrastructure services like Heroku have also greatly simplified deploying apps. The pace of innovation has been nothing short of torrid. The developer community has persistently and rapidly iterated existing tools and built new tools. As a result, productivity has increased dramatically compared to ten years ago. The time to launch an initial app, web or mobile, continues to decline. Plus, new frameworks, particularly the server side JS frameworks, enable larger and larger groups of people to become full-stack web developers. I received an email last week from a former colleague at Google telling me Toothpaste is scheduled to be retired after seven years. I read the note wistfully, remembering the excitement of my first demo, watching people use the tool those first few months and the word Toothpaste slowly enter our daily vernacular. It is my hope that many more people will feel the thrill of launch day and the pride of building a useful tool or innovative app thanks to the tremendous innovation in developer tools and frameworks.

When I first started in venture capital five years ago, I wanted to create a programmatic way to analyze companies well. My goal was to be able to step into a meeting with an entrepreneur with some kind of form that I would fill out throughout the meeting, so that by the end of the meeting I might have an understanding how the startup fits into its ecosystem. It took quite a while to devise this framework and to revise it until it became useful, practical and insightful. I spoke with friends who were consultants and who analyze companies for a living. I read many books on the topics of competition and strategy. Last, I spoke with other investors. But in the end I chose three simple frameworks that were already well-known and which fit together on two sheets of paper: The Business Model Canvas, Porter’s Five Forces, and Value Chain Analysis. Each of these frameworks evaluates a different aspect of the business. The Business Model Canvas explains concisely how a business operates. Value Chain Analysis describes where the startup fits within an ecosystem and Porter’s Five Forces exposes the level of competition the startup will face. I’m sharing these in the hopes that these frameworks might benefit entrepreneurs when selecting ideas to pursue, refining go-to-market strategy and pitching their businesses to investors. The Business Model Canvas The first sheet of paper is the Business Model Canvas which is a framework  invented by Alexander Osterwalder in a great book called Business Model Generation . The BMC describes the key operations of a business: the Value Proposition, the Key (Operating) Activities, Partners, Assets/Resources, Customer Relationships, Go-To-Market Channels, Customer Segments, Cost Structure and Revenue Streams. Filling out this form creates a document that captures what a business offers, how it reaches which customers and how profitable it could be. The Grand Unifying Framework - Matrixing Value Chains and P5F To set the business in proper context is to understand the business environment around it. To do this, I’ve matrixed the Porter’s 5 Forces Analysis and Value Chain Analysis. Combining the two yields a chart like the one below which I’ve filled out for a company I work with called Electric Imp. Electric Imp provides the infrastructure to connect all kinds of devices to the web. We sell this technology to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). I call this chart the GUF (Grand Unifying Framework). The horizontal categories denominate the value chain and the vertical categories are Porter’s Five Forces Filling out this chart accomplishes three things. First, it enumerates the value chain. Second, it offers a lens into the motivations of each player within the ecosystem. Third, it provides visibility into which players in the ecosystem have the most power and control the dollars. Each of these three concepts is essential to understand when entering a market. What To Look For In These Analyses The GUF shows the player/column the ecosystem has the most power. The column that has lowest supplier power, lowest customer power, no substitutes and highest barrier to entry is the most powerful player in the ecosystem and the one that will dictate the way most other players do business. Secondly, the GUF indicates how much competition exists within one part of the value chain in the competition row. Ideally, there isn’t much competition and the barriers to entry are high which will mean a higher margin business. Intense competition means an efficient market and low margins. The BMC is a description of how a company goes to market. A well defined value proposition is the most critical thing. Next, understanding the customers and customer segments is also quite important. Last, the cost structure of the business is critical. This determines burn rate and capital requirements. For an early stage company, most of the other categories, including revenue model can be fuzzy. But the more detailed and fleshed out the BMC, the better. Frameworks FTW Frameworks provide a structured way of thinking about things and these three help me understand startups at a deeper level. I hope these frameworks help you choose the best idea to pursue, find the most effective path to market and help you to pitch your startup idea most effectively.

What is a social product? This was the question Sandi MacPherson, founder of Quibb posed to me, over lunch earlier this week. In Startupland, we bandy about terms like social, social media, virality and community when talking about products but it wasn’t until that moment that I stopped to think a bit more about what each word really means. Sandi has thought a lot about these concepts while building Quibb and she has some of the clearest points of view on social products I’ve encountered. These are my notes from that conversation: Social Social products have three parts: product (the technology), means of user acquisition/growth (virality) and community (people). The first part, the product, has three features: user profiles, a relationship metaphor (follow/friend) and some kind of data stream/feed for content sharing. But just building a product with these three features isn’t anywhere close to enough to be successful. Next, the service needs to grow. Viral The most natural growth mechanism for social products is through the network itself. This is virality. Viral products use invitation systems to grow quickly. Invitation systems include Facebook Connect, refer-a-friend like Dropbox or team/clan structures like World of Warcraft. Virality is a marketing tactic. Virality belongs to the same category as SEO, SEM, content marketing, affiliate channels because it’s a customer acquisition vector. Virality differs a bit from these others because successful viral acquisition requires deeper product integration than most advertising. Nevertheless, virality is a marketing tactic, one that is increasingly a science. Community But product and viral growth still aren’t enough. The least well understood, documented and discussed but most important element of social products is community. Community is the x-factor. Communities aren’t products or part of the product. They are amalgamations of people who interact with each other in a certain context and a known set of norms and values. Communities are the lifeblood of social networks. Everything else is just infrastructure - an empty city. Communities often have very strong culture and values. Reddit encourages a subversive culture. Hacker News champions contentious debate. Tumblr and Instagram fetishize aesthetics. Quibb’s community strives for knowledge. Fostering communities requires the right chemistry. Mixing the user growth, content moderation, and set of values/norms, to create the substrate for a vibrant city is a constant battle. Accidental Alchemy No one I know talks about how to build community. Perhaps that because many of the communities that exist today were created by happy accident. At some point, they just worked and trying to find the root cause of that success is a fool’s errand because the success was the combination of a thousand little things. Maybe one day we’ll understand better how to consistently grow vibrant communities online. That all begins with first understanding the key parts of a social product.

There’s an adage that is being passed around by entrepreneurs that goes something like this: “As soon as you raise this round, it’s time to start worrying about the next round.” I think it’s a wise adage. It’s similar to my most important principle of fund raising which is “Raise enough money to achieve a set of milestones that will attract a subsequent round of investment from new investors.” Those two ideas are simple and logical. But what does this mean for the business on a very tactical level? How much revenue? How much dilution should an entrepreneur expect? What should valuations look like over time? Below, I’ve tried to summarize the way a hypothetical startup might think about the cap table evolution, valuation and revenue growth. First and foremost, a huge caveat: every business is different. Every financing is unique and this data is based on generalization and medians and averages. Capitalization Table Evolution Below is a hypothetical cap table for a startup through four rounds of financing, seed through Series A. The table shows the common shares ownership with time and the typical investment stakes of seed, A, B and C investors. These stakes are highly variable (see caveat). The most important line for the founding team is the last line called Equivalent Exit Price. This metric tracks the exit price of the business required to generate $30M in net proceeds to the founders with each subsequent round of financing/dilution. Keep in mind, the point of raising money is to create a larger and larger company. As always, it’s important to align VC and founder incentives on exit size Ownership(in %) Founding Seed Series A Series B Series C Common 100 65 50 39 29 Seed investors 15 10 6 4 A Investors 25 25 25 B Investors 20 20 C Investors 15 Pool 20 15 10 7 Equivalent Exit Price (in $M) 30 46 60 77 103 Valuation Evolution Below is the evolution of the valuation of our hypothetical startup. Again, this is highly variable. I’m estimating valuation using the forecasted burn for 18 months of runway and dividing that by the new investor's share. It’s an estimate because I don’t take into account the dollars the insiders would contribute as pro-rata but it’s good enough for our purposes. Valuation Evolution Ownership(in %) Founding Seed Series A Series B Series C Employees 7 18 45 75 Cost per Employee (in $) 12,000 12,000 12,000 12,000 18 Month Burn (in $M) 0.5 1.5 3.9 9.7 16.2 Implied valuation (est.) 10 16 49 108 Revenue Evolution This last table shows the revenue growth of our hypothetical startup. I calculate revenue by taking the valuation and then using a calendar year valuation to revenue multiple - called CY Revenue Multiple in this chart. That figure is an average of more than 25 SaaS businesses’s financing histories. Revenue Evolution Ownership(in %) Founding Seed Series A Series B Series C CY Revenue Multiple 13 11 15 Implied CY Revenue (in $M) 1 4 7 Frameworks, Not Absolutes My aim with this post is to provide a framework for thinking through the cap table, revenue and valuation evolution of your startup over time. The particular figures will vary depending on market cycles, sectors, teams, ideas and a thousand other variables. But in sharing this framework, I hope it helps those entrepreneurs plan for a successful financing path for this fund raise and every fund raise for their business - a little bit of tactics to promote that great adage above.

One of my favorite courses in engineering grad school was Marketing which was taught by a brilliant quirky professor. On the first day of class,  our professor wrote on the board this equation: Innovation = Invention + Go To Market Addressing a group of engineers who prided themselves on their technical skills, this professor of marketing tried to instill in us that invention alone isn’t enough to create innovation. The invention has to be coupled with a way of understanding the customer, speaking to that customer, educating the customer and ultimately convincing the customer to adopt the invention. Only when the customer base has adopted the invention at scale have we truly innovated. Aside from customer development, the other the most important component of marketing is timing. Sometimes even the best inventions coupled with fantastic marketing still do achieve innovation. Because the market simply isn’t ready for them. It not infrequently in the Valley that you might hear, “We built [insert successful company name here] three years before. We were just a little too early.” Timing the market is one of the most difficult things to do. Sometimes entrepreneurs fall into the right place at the right time with the right idea. Other times, they might need a few years working within an industry for to understand the long-term trends of a customer or user base and the opportunities the industry affords. And then there are the exceptions, entrepreneurs clearly have a knack for market timing. Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, David Sacks are all repeat entrepreneurs who have had success in several industries. If I were to update the professor’s equation, I would write: Innovation = Invention + Go To Market + Timing

In the past 12 months, we’ve seen at least three major acquisitions of social networks by larger social networks.  Facebook acquires Instagram. Google acquires Waze. Yahoo acquires Tumblr. And we are likely to see quite a few more given the dramatic growth of mobile messaging clients and social networks of all different kinds. While each of these acquisitions has their own particular motivations,  underpinning all three is user engagement. Engagement means activity which translates to advertising dollars. Additionally, it is not unreasonable to suspect that all of these acquisitions will one day be used to bolster the parent companies own social network: Facebook and Google+. Yahoo’s plans are less clear. The success of these acquisitions boils down to one question: could a patchwork quilt of social networks succeed? How do you integrate two networks together without alienating the communities and destroying the value of the acquired company? Acquiring a social network is not like acquiring another consumer business. There is an additional variable that increases the integration complexity dramatically: the community. Each social network is a community with proprietary norms and manners. Often times these networks have very different cultures that don’t necessarily mix well together. Google’s YouTube acquisition was probably the first major social networking acquisition that ultimately became a success. By and large Google let the company operate independently in recognition of its dramatically different culture, both internally and within the community, melding the Google Plus and YouTube graphs over a few years. Facebook is following suit with the Instagram acquisition. In a next 18 to 24 months,  I am anticipating a flurry of social networking acquisitions. These might be gaming social networks, mobile messaging clients, professional networks. The key to the success of these acquisitions will be stitching the communities together.

Recently, hardware companies have been popping up in all kinds of places. Nest is building the next thermostat. Sonos sells seamless and beautiful soun systems. Thalmic Labs and Leap Motion are innovating in alternate forms of computing control. Electric Imp is building the platform-as-a-service to connect devices to the web via Wifi and so on. Hardware investments are blossoming because software is reinvigorating the market. Hardware companies face deeper logistical challenges, greater likelihood of margin erosion, and more complex go-to-market strategies than their software cousins. But subscription revenue streams like streaming music services or device remote control breathe life into hardware companies, driving ultimately higher margins and more sustainable revenue streams. In response to these trends, the hardware hacker community is flourishing. Winners at many Bay Area hackathons focus explicitly on hardware hacks using Arduino to commandeer electric devices. Others are building applications atop Raspberry Pi. These often teams comprise both hardware engineers and web engineer. Hardware represents new, exciting challenges to conquer. It’s precisely this union of hardware actively communicating with software in novel ways that is electrifying venture capitalists. Hardware companies may always face additional complexity but the reward has never been larger: new markets, subscription revenue streams and phenomenal teams make for great investments.

In the center of Google’s campus lie a cluster of four buildings:  40, 41, 42 and 43. Contained within building 42 was the epicenter of product management: Jonathan Rosenberg’s office. Immediately next to his office stood a collection of three bookcases containing a library of different books on various topics that JR curated. I used to pass that library every day on my way to meetings and each time I walked past, I would pause to see which new volumes had arrived. Edward Tufte might have spoken at a Google Tech talk and left behind 15 copies of his work. Or a new shipment of linear regression textbooks may just have arrived. Or some new studies on machine learning might have popped up. Of all the perks at Google, the access to continuing education is perhaps the one that receives the least press and most undeservedly so. Tech talks, negotiations seminars, sales training,  all the education you needed was there. It is a great feeling when someone takes interest in your education. Sometimes that interest can be a grand gesture but more often than not it is a combination of small ones, like a new book in a product management library or a ticket to a deeply relevant conference. I firmly believe that every startup should have a continuing education program, formal or informal. As founders and investors, the best investments we can make are the ones in our teams. Those investments provide compounding benefits to the company. First they engender tremendous feelings of goodwill. Second the education improves our performance and helps us better achieve our potential. Third they serve as fantastic recruiting differentiators. A sticker graced the spine of each of those books:  Property of the Google  Product Management Library.  I must sheepishly admit about a third of the books on my bookshelf at home today have that sticker. Those books have been permanently borrowed and put to good use: dog-eared and weathered and battered. And each time I look at them, I remember that bookcase outside of JR’s office.

I once read a book by Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist researching decision-making from USC, about a man who had lost the capacity to feel emotions after he was struck by lightning. Much to my surprise, his man was totally incapable of making decisions. His cognitive ability, the capacity to process and analyze data, remained fully intact. He could articulate the pros and cons of every alternative to each decision. His logical ability was flawless. But, he never could decide on an option. There’s something indescribable about the decision to start a company; it’s frustrating to explain to someone else who doubts your decision. You can rationalize it and list the pros and cons, but ultimately it’s the emotional commitment to a vision or to a team that drives us to make the leap. And what a thrill irrationality is

Pricing is one of the most challenging decisions for any startup.  One of the simplest ways of discovering customer willingness to pay is simply to ask them. At first blush, that might seem a reasonable and effective solution, it is prone to wild inaccuracy. Absolute pricing judgments are hard without reference points. For example: How much would you be willing to pay for a new iPhone? It’s a very challenging question to answer in the abstract. It all depends on what the phone can do and what sacrifices I would have to make to be able to afford that phone. That calculus isn’t any different for smart phones, expense management software, or flash storage. Every pricing conversation is a game of trade-offs. Instead of asking what a customer might pay for your product, an absolute pricing question, it’s more effective to ask a relative pricing question: Would you be willing to pay more for a new iPhone or a new Android HTC One? How much would you be willing to pay for a mobile CRM compared to a desktop CRM? If flash storage improves performance by 30%,  how much more would you be willing to pay than a standard hard disk? These comparative questions establish a point of reference for the customer and force them to make a relative value judgment by comparing a new product to an existing product where value and price are known. This is  much more valuable data because the opinions will reflect more accurately the feedback you will receive in the market. No decision is ever made in the abstract - they are always trade-offs  because every customer’s resources are finite. Purchasing decisions are no exception. The hypothetical “how much would you pay for X?” question will always generate bad data because the decision is made in the abstract. On the other hand, comparative pricing questions establish relative value between existing products. You will quickly be able to tell which products are more important and valuable. And in talking to your potential customers, you will better understand both the competitive solutions and the complementary solutions for your product. Most importantly of all,  you’ll understand the pricing decision process for your customers.  You may very well find  different segments of customers have radically different decision-making processes and your products features and pricing should reflect those differences. I use relative pricing questions in researching the market opportunities for startups and on the whole they shed much more inside the customers'  viewpoint than absolute pricing questions. I hope you can use it in your pricing discovery processes and find it to be as effective as I have.

Over the past 15 years, we’ve seen a wholesale migration of software development on the web towards cloud away from client/server models.  The  cloud offers many benefits: seamless upgrades, synchronization of data across different devices and lesser hardware requirements. But the cloud centralizes all the data. All of our Dropbox files, Google documents, and emails are held within one or few companies' servers - which provides easy access for hackers and government. It’s unclear whether or not the PRISM affair will dramatically change the American public’s view of cloud software. But should a large wave of privacy sentiment sweep the country, the natural response to cloud software would be an evolution towards peer-to-peer. Peer-to-peer communication fragments data storage amongst clients without the need for storage on a central server. Instead, data is stored within one computer or across many different computers in a network, most-often encrypted. A huge wave in the early 2000s, peer-to-peer communication has become less visible of late. But that doesn’t mean its use hasn’t grown. The same technology that Napster brought to the masses for music file sharing is also  powers Bitcoin payments, Skype chats and privacy centric storage companies like AeroFS, Wuala and many others. After a decade’s worth of investment in cloud technology, one might argue that a wholesale reversal from cloud to rich applications and peer-to-peer communication is unrealistic. But the rise of the mobile application actually makes this transition easier. Many mobile applications are thick clients that use cloud services for synchronization but otherwise provide all their functionality locally.  Swapping out cloud synchronization for peer-to-peer synchronization could provide a similar service to users while offering additional privacy. These rich clients could provide a huge installed base for peer-to-peer networks to bloom. Popular opinion is a fickle creature and if the millions of Internet users in the US suddenly decide to prioritize data security, peer-to-peer consumer services will experience a tremendous revival.

Reading TechMeme and HackerNews this morning, you’ll find more stories about legal issues relating to technology than stories about innovation: the PRISM affair, the DoJ’s suit against Apple for anticompetitive ebook pricing, Samsung’s win of a sales injunction banning iPhones and iPads, Chinese hacking of US assets, patent trolling and reform and so on. It’s frustrating. But this isn’t a trend that will reverse its course. In the center of this firestorm is the user and his data, bewildered by the scale and magnitude of these confrontations. Given the upheaval happening at the intersection of technology and government, the best thing we can do as a society is to educate the electorate and actively participate in the creation of legislation and regulation of the tech industry and work to create laws that reflect the values of the people. But when 28% of Americans don’t use the internet and 32% lack broadband access and our elected officials lack the depth of knowledge to grok tech, we have to start with computer literacy. Only then will we able to move in the right direction. And in the short term, it has to be tech community that takes the initiative because we have the most to lose.

The reason most startups go out of business is they run out of money. The CEO bears the responsibility for raising money, managing those assets and growing the business into profitability and ultimate sustainability. But the CEO shouldn’t bear this load alone. To help defray that critical responsibility, the CEO ought to have a consigliere,  an advisor who helps plan, allocate resources, and illuminate the  trade-offs between decisions. That consigliere is the head of finance and the most under-appreciated startup team member. In my experience, there is a remarkable difference in the management discipline and organization between companies who have built a finance team and those who haven’t. Typically, I recommend hiring a head of finance right after the Series A or when the team reaches about 10 to 15 people. At that point, the company undergoes an increase in financial complexity having to deal with 409A valuations, auditing, producing financial statements for investors, real estate decisions and so on. In addition to tactical help, the head of finance is responsible for expressing the long-term vision of the company in numbers, which is as important in the early stages of the business as during the roadshow for your IPO. A startup’s financial statements are the most succinct expression of the company’s intentions and goals and strategy. Like a battlefield map, financial statements lay out a strategy for a company. They detail the requirements necessary to ensure the business succeeds  including the revenue model, the sales cycle, hiring plan, cash burn, and all of the assumptions underpinning the strategy. Best of all, financial analysis clearly expresses the trade-offs made by different prioritizations. Scenario planning becomes concrete:  if we hire two more salespeople, we can’t afford to hire two more engineers which would delay the product by three months but increase revenue in the short term  and potentially put us in a better position to raise a follow on financing.  Which is the right decision? Those kinds of strategic questions arise often for startups particularly those undergoing fast growth or operating in competitive markets. In these situations having strong head of finance can be the difference between success or failure. Financial planning is all about ensuring the company has all the resources it needs to accomplish its goals and that’s priority number one for every startup.

We all type quite a bit. I’ve never measured how many words each day I type but I imagine it’s probably a few thousand each week between my laptop and my mobile phone and across emails and blog posts. And no one can deny the toll this takes on our wrists. In the past week, I’ve been suffering from some carpal tunnel pain particularly as I’ve been coding more. Coding often requires all kinds of odd key combinations because of the varying syntaxes of CSS, Ruby, R, MySQL and the English language. There are all kinds of solutions to this problem, ergonomics being the first.  But I can’t imagine in 10 years, as the volume of indications continues to increase, that we will all still be typing away on these primeval keyboards. So, instead I’ve adopted dictation. Initially, I used the built-in Apple dictation feature and then tried using Google’s. More recently I’ve switched entirely to Nuance’s Dragon. This blog post is entirely dictated and all of the posts for the last two weeks also. I remember using MacSpeak 10 years ago which was Apple’s speech recognition effort. Who could forget the frustration that followed the initial hope of being able to control a computer through voice? Since then, huge leaps have been made. Today, accuracy is close to 99%. A good analogy to demonstrate the progress might be comparing Apple’s Newton and the iPhone. In five years, I believe voice will be as common a mode of data input as keyboards. It’s more natural to speak to a computer rather than type because the computer can respond at the pace of your thoughts. I spend less time responding to emails because of dictation.  It’s also much faster pen these posts because instead of focusing on spelling or typing or corrections, I’m focused on the content and the computer takes care of the rest. Startups are taking notice and beginning to differentiate through voice. Roobiq is a CRM that solves the data entry problem through voice. Siri and Google Now are the more obvious examples. These will only become more common and particularly on the phone. At first blush, it might seem that the smart phone ushered out the era of voice  in favor of SMS and short form messaging and mobile application use. After all what fraction of time spent on a mobile making telephone calls? But a more accurate refinement of that statement that the mobile phone ushered out the era of synchronous voice. The mobile phone will be the harbinger of the asynchronous voice-to-text era. And our wrists will be the better for it.

Do you measure your product’s time to utility? If not, you should. The best products reward users as quickly as possible after installation and account creation. But it’s easy to forget about this and as a result, watch conversion rates from download/install-to-active fall. CRM products have the longest time to utility of most software products. The end user, a salesperson, logs into a blank Salesforce installation. She must type in a bunch of data about a customer. If the customer account closes, great. But it’s not until twelve or eighteen months later when the customer considers renewal and she has to strategize how best to pitch the customer that this salesperson benefits from any of the data entered into the CRM. On the other hand, sales managers' time to utility for CRM products is much faster. As soon as the team enters in the current pipeline data, he can see the sales forecast for the current month. This difference in time to utility is one of the causes of the tension in adopting CRM tools. It’s present in many enterprise tools that generate reports for management because there’s a time-to-value mismatch between the roles. Consumer products tend to offer faster time to utility: Google search, Facebook news feed, Twitter feed. Immediately after searching or logging in, the user receives some value: the right results or some relevant updates. But if you think about the most frustrating software to use, by and large, the time to utility will be long and the magnitude of that utility will be small. Measure your time to utility for all your product’s segments and try to minimize it. You’ll see the impact at every step of the conversion funnel.

As the number of Android users continues approach 1B devices, more and more startups are looking to deploy complementary applications on Android, in addition to their iOS applications. Some startups are beginning looking to launch on Android first. But the dynamics of the Android app store are quite different from iOS. In fact, they are much more challenging for startups. Like iOS’s app store, Android’s app store also ranks applications. But the ranking system is very different in four key ways: TL/DR Android seems to tune/control the charts to encourage fewer large movements of applications within the rankings than iOS. The rankings aren’t wholly calculated from the previous hour’s downloads like iOS. As a result, it’s much harder for new entrants to break into the top of the charts on Android than iOS. Existing top applications are much better insulated from competitors than with Apple. But, the decreased volatility means paid customer acquisition is much more cost-effective on Android, presuming the app’s engagement and monetization are similar across platforms, because if your app can reach the top of the charts, it’s much less likely to be dethroned and the cost-per-install of the paid users can be amortized over a much larger organic user base who discovers the app by virtue of the high rank. The competitive categories vary significantly from Android to iOS. This means there is probably an arbitrage opportunity to bring the best apps from iOS to Android. To tell the real story behind climbing these app stores, I’ve been gathering ranking data from the app stores for the past two weeks. Android Ranking Movements are Much More Subtle than Apple In a given day, the average iOS app could move up to 50 ranks up or down. The typical Android app moves up to 12 slots. Below are two charts comparing the variances of all applications on each store in a two week window. An average iOS application might vary by fifty to one hundred ranks or more in a two week period. On the other hand, the same application on Android wouldn’t see more than a 50 rank fluctuation. Volatility Difference is Pretty Consistent No Matter Your App Rank Now you might point out that apps in the lower ranks (200-300) should move much more than those apps in the top 10. Perhaps that explains the difference between Android and iOS. But that’s not true. iOS has larger variances at every rank bucket. Compare these two charts that show the variance of applications that reached rank 10, 50, 100 and 200 at some point during my test. Android apps tend to stay put where they are much more than iOS no matter if they are ranked three, thirty or three hundred. Competitive Categories Below is one way of looking at competitiveness by category for each of these app charts. The more the average application can change rank within a category, the better the quality of competition exists ( perfect competition in the economic sense). Where variances are low, there is something like an oligopoly - for example ten apps that dominate the top ten. Click on the images to enlarge them. On the other hand, Android’s most oligopolistic categories are Arcade & Action Games, Tools, Shopping and Racing Games.  The best categories for new entrants are News, Medical, Finance, Business. What Got You Here Won’t Get You There Android’s market isn’t a carbon copy of Apple’s. Android requires a distinct strategy considering the much stronger tendencies to reinforce the top applications within Google Play. There are many drawbacks for startups when launching on Android but the addressable market may ultimately render those challenges moot. Data Caveats With any analysis, there should be lots of caveats This is a two week study with a sample size of about 25k applications and roughly 1 data point per app per day for 14 days. - Android may seem to have a less accessible app store because they are fewer quality apps and so the best bubble to the top and stay there. I can’t make a determination either way with this data. - Looking at standard deviations and variances implies that the underlying data follow a Gaussian distribution and these data may not.

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_81_690616509" width="500px"> Last night, Elon Musk inspired the audience at D. It is hard to overstate the scope and breadth of his ambitions or the impact of his start ups PayPal, Tesla, and SpaceX on payments, automobiles and space. Behind the desire to listen to great men like Musk speak about their perspectives is a hope to receive some insight, some pearl of wisdom. Last night, I came away with two of those both about startups. First, when the inevitable question came along along asking Musk to compare his grand plans with the innovations and ambitions in photo sharing applications, Musk replied in the following way: He said that there are many ways of creating value. Photo sharing apps create a small amount of value for a huge number of people. Aggregating that small value across billions can create big companies. Second, when asked about the origins of SpaceX, his first major step to starting the business was to understand the cost structure of existing rocket companies. He and his team calculated the cost of all the materials required to build a rocket. They found that the titanium and carbon fiber and fuel represented only about 2% of the total cost of launching a rocket. In his words, the industry must be doing something silly to drive costs to their current order of magnitude. In other words, there was an opportunity to innovate by cost reduction. There is one thread common to both of these examples: Musk understands the details, the small things - the cost of titanium screws and the marginal value of a shared photo, and how they relate to the overall picture. His ability to think in systems, understanding how ecosystems react and respond to regulation and subsidies in the case of Tesla and oil and gas companies, and how PayPal fit into the world of payments and how the costs of screws and fuel fit into the overall cost of the rocket is what I admire about Elon Musk.

At the D conference yesterday, Tim Cook said many things without saying much. But one story did strike me.  Cook described the product management  and strategy process at Apple. Walt Mossberg asked Cook why the iPhone has only one flavor when the iPod had so many including the shuffle, the nano, the mini, and the classic.  Even though both products originally launched as a single model, the iPod flourished into a family of products while the iPhone has remained a single SKU. Cook responded by telling the story of the shuffle.  The original shuffle had no screen, focused primarily on shuffling music and was designed for athletes - a use case that while somewhat well served by the existing iPod, was much better served by a proprietary device. But it was only once the iPod had reached a certain scale of usage that the executive team at Apple could justify creating a child product. By that point,  it was apparent that a new customer segment had emerged that wouldn’t cannibalize their existing business. The data proved it. Say what you will about Apple’s phone strategy, and of course that might all change radically at WWDC in just 10 days, but what did come through and Tim Cook’s description of the product management process at Apple is a clear understanding of customer segments: their desires and needs.  Throughout the evening,  Cook spoke often about customer satisfaction scores and used the refrain of “customers tell me this and that” frequently. It was apparent to me that even at the executive levels of the world’s largest technology company, user centric design is paramount at Apple. But we knew that. The wrinkle is that Apple combines this design with superb product marketing. Customer segmentation, customer studies and use case analysis are at the core of the product development process. Cook followed Apple’s disciplined process to understand the market, justify the need, develop a deep understanding of the market segment and only then release a product. Like any discipline, it’s easy to describe but hard to maintain. A disciplined process like this will always be in conflict with product management by  epiphany or vision. But I think it’s something we can all learn from as startup founders, product managers and VCs. It’s block and tackle product marketing.

You have just launched your new software start up. The last webpage to go up on the website is the pricing page. Like many other SaaS startups, you decide to employ some version the three pane pricing plan: first the free version, second a paid upgrade costing between $5-$40 per month, and third an enterprise tier with a “Call for Quote” in place of the price. A few days after you launch, an enterprise customer contacts you asking for a quote. You respond with an offer that significantly higher per seat than the paid plan. Let’s test the waters, you think. Having seen your pricing page, the enterprise customer asks why the enterprise tier is so much more expensive than the paid tier. After all, the cost to deliver the service for each kind of user, whether individual or enterprise, is the same. Serving Two Customers at the Same Time This dilemma is called channel conflict. The pricing page is trying to serve two contrasting customer segments: the individual who wants to upgrade and the enterprise looking for a companywide or team-wide plan. Each of these customers perceive the value of your service differently and each has a wildly varying willingness to pay. Typically, the individual user is on a budget. They might be paying for the service out of pocket and are generally price sensitive. As the founder, your strategy might be to maximize the number of individuals on the service in order to drive bottoms up adoption. So instead of maximizing revenue from this segment, price the paid tier to generate profit after paying the cost to acquire the customer and cost to serve the customer. This is cost-based pricing - charging the customer your cost to deliver the service plus some mark-up. On the other hand, the enterprise customer will derive significantly more value from the use of your service than the individual [1]. Additionally, this customer segment has the capacity to pay orders of magnitude more than an individual who upgrades to a paid tier. So quite naturally you want to capture some fraction of that value. This is called value-based pricing. Rationalizing Channel Price It’s hard to convince one customer segments to pay based on cost-based pricing and another to pay on value-based pricing on the same page for nearly the same service. So, you have two choices. First you can distinguish the paid and enterprise products by offering enterprise-level support, service-level agreements, and IT management features that aren’t available in the paid-tier in order to justify the value based pricing to the enterprise customer. Many startups pursue this route like Yammer. Second, you can create different websites or even brands for different segments. Within each website, one segment is prioritized and the marketing copy and pricing page reflect this. In retail, brand name drugs and generics serve different customer segments the same products at different prices (value vs cost-based pricing). This strategy can be harder for start ups because of the complexities managing two or more customer types at the same time. Whichever route you decide for your startup, the most important thing is to determine which customer segments you’ll be charging on a cost basis and which you’ll be charging on a value basis. Clearly separating the value proposition either with feature disparity or by creating different brands will be critical to supporting the pricing differences between the two segments. Do you have other strategies for mitigating channel conflict? Let me know on this Branch. Footnotes: [1]: According the US Census, a 5k person organization pays more than 50% more in payroll than a 10 person company. So at the very least, in larger organizations, an employee’s time is worth 50% more to an employer.

About a year ago, Peter Thiel spoke at a PandoDaily event where he extolled the last mover advantage : “First mover isn’t what’s important — it’s the last mover. Like Microsoft was the last operating system, and Google was the last search engine.” I hear this refrain more and more in pitches. The thinking goes the last entrant to the market benefit from mistakes made by earlier entrants. But being the last mover isn’t always advantageous. The reality is more nuanced. When Last Mover Works Technology, platform or behavioral discontinuities . The last mover is the agent of Clayton Christensen’s Innovator’s Dilemma embodied. It’s the company that pursues an incumbent with faster, better or cheaper solution and in particular a solution that cannibalizes the incumbent’s business model typically because of a lower cost structure. While Google did develop a better ranking algo, Google also had a fundamental cost advantage. Google served queries at more than an order of magnitude less cost than its competitors, who used expensive Oracle database servers, enabled by Google’s investment in running its software on commodity hardware. Zynga leveraged Facebook’s Open Connect platform to grow its casual gaming business much, much faster than incumbents Pogo and others. The dramatically lower cost of customer acquisition on Facebook, enabled by an agreement between the two companies, fueled Zynga’s rise. Instagram, “the last photo sharing service”, took advantage of a behavioral discontinuity, the explosive growth of mobile phone snapshots driven by high quality cameras in smart phones, to threaten Facebook’s photo sharing dominance. Unbundling is another kind of discontinuity that involves identifying valuable segments within an incumbent’s customer base and serving them with a dedicated product . Companies like AirBnB, Uber, Path, and Axial are pursuing this strategy disrupting Craigslist, Facebook and LinkedIn.  Last mover is an advantage because the segment’s needs have become clear and the incumbent’s horizontal product strategy hampers the product customization to serve even the most valuable segments. When Last Mover is Challenged Last movers can be a challenged by incumbents when the last movers have no discontinuity to bring to bear, face the network effects of incumbent transactional market places, are challenged by low margin competition, or face significant IP battles. Priceline, “the last online travel agent” was founded in 1997. Bill Gurley wrote a great post outlining how Priceline won the lion’s share of the online travel market by reducing their rake . The larger the market place, the greater the monopoly, the more it can reduce rake to starve competitors. Craigslist’s strategy of largely ignoring monetization has prevented thousands of competitive market places from competing with it. Amazon’s ability to operate at zero profit margin prevents ecommerce threats from rising. Compare their revenues to their profit . It’s hard for any ecommerce company to raise the capital required to build a competing business when your competition is happy with zero net margin. Akamai exerts huge pressure on the CDN market by litigating competitors out of business. Here’s a quote from a Gartner report : “How to tell when a CDN has arrived: Akamai sues them for patent infringement.” Survivorship Bias While it’s true that Microsoft and Google eventually came to dominate their industries, it wasn’t necessarily because they were last. Of course,  there were operating system companies and search engines that followed (Jollicloud and Cuill) for example. Instead, Microsoft and Google’s market power, their ability to keep their advantage in the market over time by anticipating discontinuities has enabled them to remain top dog — at least for now. Takeaways for Startups When looking to take advantage of the last mover advantage, ensure that you can leverage a clear discontinuity in the market.

At today’s Under the Radar Consumerization of IT (CoIT) , the predominant theme will be antagonism. Friction, dislike, resentment within organizations marks opportunity for consumerization of IT startups. Taking advantage of this sentiment, Expensify employs a very deliberate marketing tactic: “Expense reports that don’t suck.” Talk to anyone who uses antiquated expense report systems and they are bound to sigh and complain, frustrated by the experience but resigned to the fact they can’t do much about it. Expensify provides those people with a better alternative and, most importantly, empowers them to change the way they work. This pattern is true for Heroku and developers inside of large companies. It’s often much faster to build and deploy a project externally on Heroku than to coordinate with IT to deploy internal resources; and those developers are much happier for it. Dropbox and Box and Yammer, all of these companies are allies of the end user. To build internal support support, CoIT companies offer much better products to users, build momentum within an organization and eventually enable users to convince or demand that IT change vendors or policies. As critical as building the right product for end users, CoIT companies ought to provide the right tools for the IT organizations who are often challenged by end users creating security challenges, demanding better tools, and on the whole pushing the IT team beyond comfort. Each one of the companies presenting today will have a problem statement that focuses on the antagonism between employees and IT. Frustration is the indicator of opportunity.

Reading through the tech press since the Facebook IPO, you might get the impression venture capitalists are still reeling from that apocalyptic offering, believe no further successes can be had in the consumer web, and so are fleeing the consumer web in droves to pursue enterprise investments. That’s because in the past year or so most major tech publications have swung from focusing on consumer products to enterprise companies. GigaOm made this transition first, now TechCrunch and PandoDaily are following suit. But the problem with sounding the alarm for the ebbing consumer investment is that just not true. Consumer investments historically have garnered massively disproportionate press coverage compared to their volume because consumer products are easier for readers to understand than enterprise technology. Consumer products evoke emotional reactions, drive page views, and build business. It’s hard to jump for joy or trigger lots of retweets over data center virtualization innovations unless that’s your cup of tea. To put this into perspective, what fraction of venture investment dollars last year were in consumer companies? About 17%. How about over the last 17 years? 16%. Here’s a chart of NVCA data for that period. Click on it to enlarge it. So 84% of venture dollars invested over the past 17 years have been invested in enterprise companies. It’s clear that enterprise investments are the bread and butter of the venture business. That trend isn’t changing. This massive swing toward enterprise investing never existed. It’s a fallacious perception. Enterprise investing has always been the norm and will continue to be for quite some time.

I started working in ad tech in 2005 and during the past eight years, the ad tech ecosystem has progressively become more sophisticated, competitive and oligopolistic. It’s hard to innovate in ad tech. But if you’re looking to start a company in the sector, you’ll need to amass proprietary data or develop a market place with unassailable liquidity to vie successfully in the market. A Mental Model for the Ad Ecosystem The structure of the ad ecosystem, greatly simplified, looks like the image above. On the left, the advertiser supplies dollars that flow to the right. The DSP (demand side platform) uses algorithms to inform an advertiser’s media purchases; i.e., which websites and mobile apps will perform best. The advertiser and DSP purchase media on the ad exchange which is an electronic market place where advertisers can buy media algorithmically and in real time on Real Time Bidding platforms. On the other side of the exchange, the publisher uses supply-side platforms to find the best paying advertisers to buy their ad inventory. There are hundreds of SSPs and DSPs, thousands of advertisers, millions of publishers but only a handful of exchanges: Google’s DoubleClick, Facebook’s FBX, Yahoo’s RightMedia, MoPub, Adap.tv and a few others. These exchanges, like most market places, exert huge network effects because advertisers are attracted to the exchanges with the most inventory selection/liquidity. The exchanges see every transaction and have unparalleled visibility and data access into their respective ecosystems. Data, data, everywhere If there’s one defining characteristic of online advertising, it’s data. Advertisers buy data and license algorithms to find better inventory. Publishers sell their data and license other algorithms to find better advertisers. In order to compete in an ecosystem of data, a startup has to bring one of three advantages to market: better algorithms to use on the same data as everyone else, better data than anyone else or a market place with the largest volume of ad inventory in a segment. Better algorithms is the fastest way of getting into the market as a startup. Similar to starting a new quant hedge fund, you develop a novel trading strategy that works and sell it to customers. But competition in ad-tech is just like the financial markets - as soon as others see your strategy working, they are likely to copy it. Over time, the marginal advantages of better algos erode. Unless a startup continues to invest heavily in algorithm improvement, it will forever be in a cat-and-mouse game. Better data: Where algorithms can be conquered, proprietary data is unassailable. With access to richer ad performance data, more detailed user data, more granular conversion funnels, your startup has created a significant barrier to entry. Better data means better results. And if you’re the only game in town, then you’ll attract big advertising budgets. Getting access to better data is very challenging. It means finding and partnering with publishers and/or advertisers on an exclusive basis for some period of time, then leveraging that data to build a successful DSP/SSP/ad network. Market places in ad tech, as in the rest of the tech industry, are beautiful things. They are natural monopolies, capital efficient and are strategically valuable. Building a new ad tech market place is the most challenging way of entering the market because of the strategic role these products play in the ecosystem. The most successful startup market places (RightMedia, Adap.tv, BlueKai, MoPub) each took advantage of a discontinuity in the market place (inventory glut, video ads, rich user data, mobile ads) to develop a foothold in the market faster than the incumbents. Over a few years, each of these companies built liquidity into their market places and now are the leaders in their segments. The Recipes for Success As the ad tech ecosystem has bloomed, competition has increased dramatically. To best position your new ad tech startup for success and develop a long term advantage, you need to develop leverage by developing proprietary data sources or by creating a market place based on some technology discontinuity. In other words, bring something to market that no one else has and that is difficult to copy.

On the day of Tableau’s IPO, a company known for innovating in data visualization, I thought I would share the most impressive HCI concept I’ve seen in a long time. In my view, Bret Victor is on the forefront of human computer interaction design. In the first two or three minutes of this video at Stanford, he demonstrates his home-built software that combines data analysis with visualization. It’s magnificent and really hard to describe because it’s so novel. Drawing Dynamic Visualizations from Bret Victor on Vimeo . Victor uses words to create and manipulate the drawing and it all seems so natural and fluid. The interaction with the software parallels a conversation between two designers over a piece of paper - which is exactly the kind of interaction that makes software seem human and natural. I hope we see an explosion of these types of tools in the future. Have you seen other great examples of human computer interaction? Let me know on Twitter about them.

When I was a little boy, I watched a cooking show on Sundays called “Jacques Pépin.” Over the course of 30 minutes, Jacques would orchestrate a symphony of raw ingredients into a dish that I yearned to smell and taste. That chicken paillard looked sumptuous. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been coding in Rails 3 quite a bit, building a collection of tools to be more effective as a VC. And oddly enough, I think back to Jacques Pepin quite often. The Jacques Pepin of the Rails world is Ryan Bates , creator of RailsCasts . Watching Ryan’s shows I’ve learned how to build AJAX search, deploy an identity management system and code beautiful charts in ten minutes each. There’s something intoxicating, exciting, and liberating about watching someone convince you of your capacity to perform a seemingly challenging feat, whether cooking or coding, by showing you how easy it is to do. It’s a testament to the power of video in teaching. Buttressing Bates' tutorials, StackOverflow has become my essential tech support community. Paste an error message into Google and the first link is bound to contain a fellow coder’s struggles and eventual solution to the problem I’m now facing. The combination of tutorial expert video and support community is immensely powerful because it shares the expertise of a master with many while scaling the support and help needed by a mass audience. I believe this form of teaching will become ubiquitous for this reason. It’s already happening in coding with Railscasts and StackOverflow, university education with 2U, gaming with Machinima and many others. Jacques Pepin never did tell me how I botched that homemade mayonnaise. But there’s someone on the web who has watched the same episode, made the same mistake and found a solution who might.

Derek Powazek questions the intrinsic economic viability social networks in his post “What If Social Networks Just Aren’t Profitable?” . It’s a logical question to pose in the aftermath of the Digg sale and the wobbly Facebook IPO. There is one clear lesson from Digg’s sale: the technology that powered a once-massive social network is worth about $500,000. The Big Digg Lesson The Atlantic summed up the essence of social networks' business models brilliantly. It’s not the technology that’s intrinisically valuable, but the activity on the network that attracts users and advertisers and produces a data by-product. Once users commit to a network, the network must develop a revenue model based upon the content created by the users. In so doing, social networks can generate huge revenues quite profitably. But these networks don’t all go to market the same way. Below is a draft taxonomy of social network revenue models. Comments welcome. Media Social Networks (MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest) - Media networks' primary insert ads into the experiences of potential customers. MySpace generated hundreds of millions of dollars by selling home page take overs and remnant ads. Facebook generates billions by providing more granular targeting across a much larger user base. Leafing through the pages of history, this is no different from the business of phone books: create a listing of people’s name and contact details and businesses will soon follow paying for inclusion. To date, ad dollars have formed the largest fraction of social network revenue dollars. Pinterest is a bit different in that advertisers will be able to drive transactions directly from whatever advertisement or sponsorship products Pinterest builds. But this is still a media business, just with a performance oriented advertiser base. Data By-Product Social Networks (LinkedIn, PatientsLikeMe) - Data by-product social networks offer free services to the main user base but sell some data product to a different customer set. LinkedIn and PatientsLikeMe have cultivated vibrant communication networks. To generate revenue, they collect, filter, serve and sell the data users create to interested parties: recruiters and professional networkers in the first case and pharmaceutical companies in the second case. Premium Subscription Social Networks (Yammer, AxialMarket, Gerson Lehrman Group, XBox Live, World of Warcraft, Dating Sites) - Sometimes access the community is valuable enough to the end user to warrant charging a monthly subscription. Yammer charges for secure, managed enterprise social networks. Axial collects fees from financial professionals to access user created deal flow. GLG collects fees to access subject matter experts. Gaming networks like XBox Live and World of Warcraft offer matchmaking and game hosting services.  Dating sites offer access to a network of candidates for a fee and often will charge for relevant digital goods or rights to communicate with other members. Pro Bono Social Networks (Chat, Email) - Email hasn’t generated much revenue since the days of dial-up when a subscription to Aol included an email address and chat account. Email and chat have since become commodified and are operated at or near a loss, ideally winning user loyalty on behalf of adjacent properties. If you use GMail, you’ll likely use Google.com more often. Freemium Social Networks: (Line) It’s hard to argue with Line’s strategy of virtual goods and stickers. Line’s 150M users spent nearly $60M on these goods in Q1. By leveraging a network effect and capitalizing on its users' desires to express emotion and individuality, Line has grown tremendously. To Be Determined Social Networks (FourSquare, Tumblr, Quora, Instagram) - For many of the newest social networks, revenue models are still nascent. Discovering the most natural form of monetization within a community is challenging. Some networks never need to find it (Instagram). Others spend years searching for it. Perhaps this group’s revenue models will fall into the above categories. Or perhaps they will create a new form of revenue model. Social networks have only existed for about 7 years. In that time, we have witnessed the growth of a few hegemonies and scores of niche players. We have retrofitted revenue models from previous eras of Internet businesses. But the data quality and density found in social networks are unlike most other computer systems. Networks are still exploring the alchemy of converting social media data to gold. One day, it will be a science.

APIs are incredibly powerful tools for enabling partners, building ecosystems and engendering success among customers. For example, Salesforce’s Force ecosystem , which enables developers to build products atop customer Salesforce installations and increases the value customers derive from Salesforce selling more seats and retaining customers longer. Google’s Maps API enables developers to spread Google Maps, building the brand, increasing distribution and all the while improving ranking by sending back user feedback signals. But for many startups, in particular proprietary data and network based businesses, APIs create one of the most effective ways to sap competitive advantage, enabling viable competitors to emerge. Twitter released their API broadly to developers who built competing front-ends and was forced to revoke access lest developers disintermediate Twitter’s relationship with its users. Facebook’s API term evolve constantly in response to perceived threats like Path and MessageMe . LinkedIn’s API is much more restrictive to prevent conflicts of interest from arising. In each of these five cases, the API provider has to consider the API’s balance of data trade : the net input of data vs net output: how much data value are you giving away compared to what you receive in return. In Twitter’s case, Twitter provided developers a content stream that would grow developer user bases for clients. But, in the end, Twitter developers couldn’t provide enough value back to Twitter to build a case for the API. Similarly, Facebook revokes access to developers with whom they perceive a negative balance of data. Facebook’s social graph is it’s most valuable asset - ceding it to others via API would be disastrous. But weaving themselves into the fabric of the web through oAuth and identity increases the net data into Facebook while allying partners across the Internet with Facebook. LinkedIn’s restrictive API is essential because they are a data business. They sell data to interested recruiters. Too lax of an API might enable wily recruiters to skirt payment requirements and ultimately copy the relevant data for themselves. APIs are great strategic tools. They can reinforce and grow businesses, partner ecosystems and customer value. But improperly deployed APIs can also undermine the business you’re building. Ensure your balance of data trade is always overwhelmingly positive before releasing your API. h/t to David Hammer for helping me think through this post

In the summer of 2008, a crisis evolved on my team at Google: social networks had grown exponentially. The AdSense network was flooded with social network page impressions whose poor performance challenged  advertisers and Google alike. During that summer, we formed a tiger team of about four or five key people. We shed our daily responsibilities, relocated our desks to a conference room in a deserted building on the edge of campus where we brainstormed and debated and wrote patents and developed a plan of action. Those few weeks were some of the most productive of my time at Google. Reading through Ken Segall’s book, Insanely Simple: The Obsession that Drives Apple’s Success , I came across this passage which reminded me of the summer spent on that tiger team. There are many who believe Steve Jobs was a creative genius. I think it would be more accurate to say he was a genius who loved creativity. Jobs greatest strength may have been clearing the way for creative people to achieve their potential. Segall argues Jobs' relentless defense of creativity made him and his companies great. Creativity blossoms in environments of mercilessly small teams, honest/direct/brutal feedback, and “no compromises” attitudes.   Practically speaking this means deploying small teams on projects and constraining meeting sizes; empowering/trusting these small teams to make bold strides; hiring well; providing clear direction and honest feedback - ultimately enabling faster iteration cycles for better results. But it doesn’t take a crisis to form tiger teams or champion and defend creativity. We can do these things every day. It’s about waking up in the morning and asking, “How will I enable greatness today?”

Craigslist’s generic market place gave rise to fifty or more single-purpose alternatives some of which are quite valuable companies: AirBnB, Care.com, 99Designs, oDesk, CustomMade, Gazelle. Each of these startups operates verticalized market places that solve customer problems better than Craigslist’s generic platform. In so doing, these startups have grown their observed markets. The same unbundling trend will happen to social networks. Generic social networks will continue to succeed. But their most attractive users in the best segments will be systematically poached by verticalized competition. Today in the US, there are three major generic social networks: Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Personal, professional and news networks. In each case, they serve a vast cross-section of people. Facebook’s dominance is challenged by mobile-first messaging applications. Some of these offer a better product experience for core functions (Instagram, WhatsApp), others offer localized products that feel more native (Line, WeChat) and, others still offer better tools for self-expression (Tumblr) and last others offer more intimate networking (Path, Avocado, Couple). LinkedIn, host to the world’s resumes and workflow tool for recruiters, is challenged by dedicated professional communities offering workflow tools on top of social graphs. SpiceWorks is a community of IT professionals that also provides IT management services. Axial is an online network that helps connect buyers and sellers of private companies. Doximity is a social network for doctors that provides secure collaboration for cases. Each of these segments represents tremendously valuable audiences whose these products could have been built on LinkedIn but are better served by dedicated tools. Twitter, the news syndication and discussion component, is challenged by services like Quibb and Yammer which use smaller social networks to filter and discuss news, in particular professional news. Make no mistake, each of the major social networks, like Craigslist, can continue to thrive despite unbundled competitors. But many of the most valuable users and products will be built outside of the ecosystem. Unlike Craigslist, these social networks have far more capitalistic cultures, much larger balance sheets and are on the whole much more acquisitive which in the long term might be their best defense.

Who can forget gems like these word problems from 3rd grade math class? Q: Jack walked from Santa Clara to Palo Alto. It took 1 hour 25 minutes to walk from Santa Clara to Los Altos. Then it took 25 minutes to walk from Los Altos to Palo Alto. He arrived in Palo Alto at 2:45 P.M. At what time did he leave Santa Clara? It was during those classes that our mathematics teachers taught us how to work backwards through the problem. A: You can work backwards from the time Jack reached Palo Alto. Subtract the time it took to walk from Los Altos to Palo Alto. Then subtract the time it took to walk from Santa Clara to Los Altos. Working backwards is one of the most important skills founders and startups employ because it’s a technique to reverse engineer success. It means planting a flag in the ground and asking, “How do we get there with what assets and constraints we have?” This is true for growth, marketing, fund raising, hiring, financial planning, management and many other functions of startups. At last week’s Growth Hacking conference Eliot Schmuckler, responsible for growth at LinkedIn and now VP of Product & Growth at Wealthfront presented his techniques for driving growth. First, he defines the right growth goal, a single most important number. Second, he determines the growth drivers by working backwards from his goal. How many users does he need when? Which growth channels will provide what fraction of his users? Under which circumstances can his funnels grow to meet the desired targets for growth? How must his team ramp growth to accomplish the goal? Coincidentally, I met a head of marketing candidate for a portfolio company last week. When I asked him about his marketing methodology, he said, “I measure gross margin by cohort and work backwards from there.” He was embodying Schmuckler’s advice. Some of my recent posts like Hiring Your Start up’s First Salesperson and The Most Important Principle of Fund Raising work backwards from constraints to make an argument about how best to think about fund raising and when to start building a sales team. Working backwards isn’t always the best technique. Agile product engineering and management favor iterative development and tend to avoid longer term planning which can be particularly valuable when discovering product market fit and iterating quickly. But working backwards does work well in cases when longer term plans are required. By identifying goals and constraints we can find reverse engineer solutions within those parameters.

Kenny van Zant drew this diagram for me on white board and I think it’s the best visualization of how SMB SaaS freemium business grow. The diagram highlights a few important mechanics of the SMB SaaS business model. In any given freemium user base, small-office/home-office (1 to 20 employee shops) users tend to be a few times larger in size than true SMB customer (20 to 500 employees). Most of these SOHO customers remain unpaid evangelists. A few of these customers grow into SMBs and become paying customers - they cross the dashed line in this diagram. But most paying users for freemium services are SMBs. While these mechanics may be well known, there are three counterintuitive things about the SMB SaaS model. Counterintuitive Point #1: The SMB Market Opportunity is 2x Larger than the SOHO Opportunity Below is a bar chart showing the number of employees working in businesses by size of employees using data from the US Census. While there are nearly 5M SOHOs in the US and only about 1M SMBs, there are twice as many employees in the SMB segment than in the SOHO segment, 38M in SMB and 21M in SOHO. For any business charging on a per seat model, this means the SMB market is about twice as large as the SOHO market. Counterintuitive Point #2: SOHO Customers are Just As Important as SMBs Despite the typically lower conversion rates and smaller business opportunity of SOHOs, SOHOs are critical in SMB SaaS success. They are the word-of-mouth marketing force that blogs and tweets and drives mobile app store volume to boost chart rankings and tells their friends about this great free product they are using to solve their problem. Counterintuitive Point #3: Freemium Businesses Reverse the Hunter and Farmer Sales Roles In traditional software businesses, the enterprise sales team hunts. They acquire leads, cold call, and push customers to convert. Their counterparts, the inside sales team, nurture and cultivate these relationships to prevent churn and grow revenue through up-sell. Freemium businesses reverse the roles. The inside sales team fields the freemium leads from free user base, make the cold calls and push the customers to convert. The enterprise sales team looks for multiple teams within the same company paying separately, builds a relationship and grows revenue through up-sell, helping their customers grow. A Different Animal While SMB SaaS business may seem like traditional software businesses scaled down, they aren’t. The SMB and SOHO markets require a wholly new marketing approach that may seem counterintuitive at first, but when implemented well, can build very large businesses.

To many entrepreneurs, hiring the first salesperson is a mystery. When should I do it? How much should I pay this person? How do I structure the work? The great part about sales teams and sales departments is that they quantitative - sales teams thrive on numbers. At the most fundamental level, sales productivity has to exceed costs. So let’s answer the question of when to hire a salesperson by understanding the financial mechanics of a sales team. When building a sales team, there are three things to consider: The costs of the sales person - salary and performance pay The output of that salesperson - sales productivity The inputs required to make a salesperson successful - lead volumes Let’s discuss each point in order. Costs Assume it costs $70k annually to hire an inside sales person: $30k in base salary, $30k in on-target earnings/performance pay (or OTE) and $10k in benefits. This means at the very least, your first sales person must close $70k in business for you to break-even on the hire. But in the early days of a sales team it’s typical to see a sales-quota-to-earnings ratio is anywhere from 1:2 or 1:6. As a sales team and product matures and price increases, this ratio can grow further. I’ll use 1:3 or $210k annual quota for this example. Outputs: Sales Productivity Sales productivity has two components: average deal size and deal velocity. Our hypothetical salesperson must sell $210k of products each year or about $1.5k of MRR per month. There are many ways of accomplishing this goal. At one extreme, our salesperson could close one $210k deal each year. At another, she might close thirty-six $580 deals each month. Any permutation in between meets the quota requirement. Selling a $210k contract is a very different sale to a very different customer from a $500 contract. Most enterprises won’t buy $210k worth of software over the phone from your inside sales person. They want to meet someone, build a relationship and trust and negotiate a contract. You’ll need a field or outside sales person for that and they fetch compensation of $250k+! Additionally, pursuing a few very large contracts introduces huge variance in sales forecasting. It’s called elephant hunting for a reason - high risk, high reward. As a startup with presumably constrained finances, the ideal first sales person produces predictable and consistent sales. This is better for performance measurement (understanding how well the sales person is doing) and cash flow management (ensuring sales is filling the coffers early and often). As a result in addition to a quota, sales managers often prescribe a sales velocity or the number of deals closed within a period. Sales velocity is dependent on your product’s price and the total number of customer contacts a salesperson can make in a month. In a month, the average salesperson has the time to convert 60 leads to customers. Assume a sales person works 20 days per month for 9 hours per day. Assume each sales call takes 45 minutes of time, 15 minutes of preparation/followup and each sale requires 3 calls (introduction, product demo and close) and voila - 60 leads. But not all leads convert. Typical conversion rates for inside sales teams are roughly 20%. Of the 60 leads, only 12 will likely convert to customers. Those 12 customers need to produce about $121 of MRR quota each which implies a pricing floor of $1400 per year. Changing the figures in the funnel, in particular, the close rates and the ratio of OTE to bookings, will alter this figure and the sales' teams profitability. Inputs: Leads Our sales person must contact 60 qualified leads, users with intent to convert to paying customers, to achieve quota. To satisfy that monthly demand, the product and marketing teams must attract enough new users and qualify leads through the funnel . Otherwise, the salesperson will lack the leads to be successful. Freemium businesses convert about 2 to 4% of new user accounts into paying customers. More traditional enterprise sales tend to convert 10 to 15% of leads (people signing up on the home page asking for information). A freemium business needs to generate about 3000 users that could pay $800 per month to gin up 60 qualified leads each month. And a traditional enterprise software startup needs to create 400 signups. Until your startup is filling the top of the sales pipeline with roughly these numbers, you risk hiring a salesperson too early. Other things to consider There are many other factors to consider when laying the foundation for your sales team including customer churn rates, customer costs to serve (account management), payback periods, contract requirements, sales person experience, internal time allocation and so on. But when your startup’s software can command a high enough price and when your lead volumes reach a certain threshold, you should have the confidence to hire your first salesperson.

Could you grow your users at 5% for 15 months? Or at 7% for 12 months? Or at 10% for 9 months? That’s how long it would take to double your user base at those growth rates. Though there is some science to growth developed by the technology-fluent marketer, aka growth hacker, growth remains a confounding art because there isn’t one feature - like implementing FB Connect or promoting Tweets or having a big red button on a home page. Rather, it is the sum product of a hundred little things. Growth is iteratively engendered; growth is tested, discovered and explored. Growth means multivariate testing combinations of product, marketing copy and design. Growth is using behavioral psychology to cajole users into doing what we ask. Worst of all, growth is a playbook whose plays change with time. On Friday, there is a Growth Hackers Conference in San Francisco with some great speakers presenting their experiences from Facebook, LinkedIn, Square and Google. I suspect the unifying theme throughout the conference will be leveraging multivariate testing software to develop continuous small short term wins into long term compounding growth. At least, that’s how we grew at Google - testing different ad targeting models. Building a library of Google.com UI experiments. If there’s one constant for growth, one secret, it’s scalable experimentation and testing frameworks. Up and to the right, up and to the right, up and to the right is the mantra we all chant. Startups have to grow users, engagement and revenue to survive. Consistent small wins drive the long term growth we all seek.

There’s something beautiful about handwriting that we’ve never been able to capture on the Web. Handwriting has style, a uniqueness to each writer and also an ability to capture the evolution of thought with crossed out words, carats and interjected clauses and margins full of edits. The image above is my favorite from Emily Temple’s curation effort of a series of famous authors' manuscripts on a Tumblog . I was thinking about how much differently this blog feels to a reader than the above draft of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The Hound of the Baskervilles.” Doyle’s writing, careful and well-spaced, clean looks like Sherlock Holmes' hand and it gives a feeling of methodological study and thought. And most of all, it is unique to Doyle. Other examples, like Nabokov’s below, confer a very different feeling of chaos and stress and long frenetic nights of writing. Unlike each of these manuscripts, this blog, no matter my emotion or state of mind, always reads the same way. We have built CSS and font service provides like TypeKit to render blogs and publications with a sense of uniqueness and personality. And though those are both great innovations, neither captures the character, the emotions and the process of the author quite like handwriting. We’re in the midst of an evolution in publishing with platforms like Svbtle and Medium and others. Part of that evolution is design. Another is curation. A third development could be related to personality and evoking the uniqueness and the state of mind of each author. Imagine a font that changed its look depending on your state of mind, rate of typing, time of day. Wouldn’t that be something? I’m not sure we’ll ever be able to translate the emotion and personality and character of handwriting from paper to iPad. And perhaps the emoticon is the zenith of that effort. But if we could replicate handwriting, I’m certain the web would be a richer, more beautiful and more interesting place for it.

Andrew Dumont wrote about his grueling schedule at a startup and the lessons on “Avoiding Burnout” which spurred a torrent of comments on HackerNews. For me, the most interesting comment is this one by Daniel Ribeiro who quotes Isaac Yonemoto : Burnout is caused when you repeatedly make large amounts of sacrifice and or effort into high-risk problems that fail…You effectively condition your brain to associate work with failure… The best way to prevent burnout is to follow up a serious failure with doing small things that you know are going to work. Burnout is a motivation problem, a listlessness, a defeatist attitude, and perhaps even a hopelessness, triggered by the lack of progress. I suspect burnout is much more pronounced for information workers - people who deal in bits each day - because unlike a mason or an architect, the product of much of our work isn’t visible. Even the tools we use, virtual to do lists and email, hide the work we’ve completed: tasks checked off and emails sent. Reading through Andrew’s advice on managing burnout, the common theme is seeking progress in life (exercise, walks, small wins, hobbies, diet). All these habits are hedges - each one offers a guaranteed little bit of progress each day. Coincidentally, NPR profiled a productivity researcher from HBS this morning. According to her research, the most important driver of productivity is motivation which aligns with Daniel’s comment. Her recommendation for improving motivation? Use tools like IDoneThis to track what you’ve accomplished each day and take the time now and again to reflect on your progress through that journey. At Google, we had an internal product called Snippets which is functionally identical to IDoneThis. I’d always believed the purpose of Snippets was to improve communication across a team and company about the contributions of employees. But perhaps I missed the more important benefit: motivation management and burnout prevention. We all need to feel like we’re making progress and simple tools like these bits of software and exercise, diet, reading and Andrew’s other suggestions are part of the antidote to burnout.

To answer that question, you have to look for examples of the best storytellers. The best storytellers are the television studios. They divide the day into different segments to reach different audiences. Morning: news. Midday: soap operas. Evening: Nightly news segues into primetime sitcom. Late night: news segues into comedy. An entrepreneur told me a few weeks ago, when we where talking about how to build a blog audience and I had asked him how he thought about content strategy. In short, segmentation was his answer. Figure out all the customer types and give each one what they want. Since that conversation, I’ve thought a lot about what it means for this blog. Should every week contain a post targeted to one particular audience segment? If so, which are the main segments within the audience? How would I even generate such an analysis? In the end, I co-opted an existing tool. Over the past week, I’ve been using my Twitter Game to bucket my roughly 7k Twitter followers and gathered some quantitative and some qualitative conclusions from the analysis. First, the quantitative results: 6% are company/corporate accounts 20% are company founders 23% are based in the Bay Area 7% are based in NYC 3610 average number of followers Second, the qualitative analysis: While I recognized many names in my Twitter follower list, it became clear that Twitter isn’t a great stay-in-touch/remarketing tool. Of the people whom I’ve met through working at Redpoint, the fraction following me on Twitter is tiny, less than 10%. That could be because of my lack of follow-up marketing or it could be because many acquaintances don’t use Twitter in this way or it could be these acquaintances don’t care what I have to say. I can’t say which. Twitter descriptions are more informative than I would have thought. Some people don’t fill them out or post mantras, but many users list their current positions and employers and for the vast majority of the 7k followers, I didn’t need to pull up their LinkedIn profiles to understand whom they are. Service providers (lawyers, real estate agents, PR firms, design firms) constitute the second largest segment after founders. I suspect they use Twitter as I do, as a form of business development and lead generation. While there are some spam accounts among my followers, there are fewer than I would have thought. I didn’t classify them but I’d estimate it’s 5% or less. Conclusions This blog does help me reach my target audience: founders of companies in the Bay Area, New York and around the world. Developing more sophisticated segments than this first-pass analysis is challenging without surveying the audience or performing engagement analysis on the content - which likely should be my next step. Twitter should build or license a tool that performs audience analysis for all its large customers and users. Knowing the basic demographics of an audience could improve content, engagement and ultimately monetization. How do you think about your Twitter followers and how to build a blog to serve them? Let me know in this branch.

When the neologism was popularized in 2004 by Tim O'Reilly, the words Web 2.0 captured a desire for the web to become interactive. It was a description of a movement towards social media and engaging users on the web. But more than an idea, it carried a design aesthetic which focused on the user, user experience and engagement. After all, users wouldn’t participate on a hostile site. We’re no longer in the Web 2.0 age - look no further than the Google Trends data to prove the point - but the relentless pursuit of the best user experience lives on in a new era, the IRL (in real life) era. The IRL era is all about mating technology and the real world. IRL means paying for a coffee with a mobile phone that never leaves your pocket (Square), or pressing a button on an app to order a taxi pickup (Uber), or checking into a flight using a mobile barcode (Passbook), or unlocking your home’s front door with a button (Lockitron), or scanning an in-store barcode to find an item cheaper on the web and buying it with 1-click (Amazon) or changing your commute route because of a bad accident (Google Now). When backend software meets the real world through a mobile phone, that’s an IRL experience. The payments systems are in place, the integrations with airlines and taxis and inventory systems and physical things like locks exist. IRL apps require radical simplicity in their design. Otherwise, they simply won’t be used. As a result, these apps are single purpose and do just one thing well. Because they are the bridge between a physical and a digital world, IRL apps also require a mastery of many different skills: radically simple mobile design, backend and API integrations, mobile application development ability, business development for key partnerships, and mobile app distribution to reach users. In Web 2.0, web pages and social interactions on the internet became accessible - and that was a pretty big wave. But the possibilities for engaging users IRL, where they spend the majority of their time are so much larger.

“What’s the difference between a string and a String?” I asked on the first day of my engineering internship at a startup. That comment drew some sighs from the other engineers in the cube. The pit in my stomach confirmed what I already knew - I was out of my depth. I had never programmed in Java before that day. And there I was, a Java engineering intern at this startup. Over the next few months, I imbibed as much as I could about object oriented programming and servlets and Struts and Tomcat and Apache and databases as I could. Boy, were those engineers patient with me. They were saints. By the end of the summer, thanks to the countless hours of help and explanation from the team, I was a productive, more confident engineer and helped ship a few (insignificant) features. But I’ll never forget that feeling of being completely lost or the gratitude I felt for the engineers who coached, encouraged and explained. We are all novices at some point whether it’s the first time we fire up an IDE and write Java code, utter a hello during our first sales call, or autograph the incorporation documents for the first startup. Mustering the will to push through the doubt and the fear takes determination and diligence. But more so, it requires asking for help and enlisting allies in a shared cause. Those engineers helped me understand the idea of succeeding together. By investing in my success, they were equipping me to invest in theirs. And ultimately, that’s what teamwork is all about.

When I started at Google, I began working in the AdSense Online Sales and Operations team. The demand for AdSense was overwhelming and we received tens of thousands of website applications each day asking to be granted permission to run Google’s ad product on their websites. Sometimes, automated approval systems would reject an application based upon strong spam or fraud signals. But thousands of applications each day demanded additional human judgement. So a team of us worked “the Bin.” The Bin was an approval tool that gathered all the data possible about an applicant from external sources and internal sources and presented the data in one hyper-data-dense screen which provided us all the information necessary to make a decision as quickly as possible. In my eyes, it was the zenith of productivity software. The leverage was astounding: a team of five to ten people could routinely process about 10k requests each day. Applications were approved and dispatched in a few seconds with some keyboard shortcuts. Over the past few days, I’ve been building a “Bin” of my own that ingests Twitter followers and LinkedIn contacts. I dubbed it the “Twitter Game.” The tool is downright ugly but it’s effective. The Twitter Game gathers data from the web about these users through various APIs, presents each individual one at a time on the screen and I sift through them looking for interesting people to meet and startups I should know about. The salient accounts are placed into a follow up bucket with a few keyboard shortcuts (which are surprisingly easy to code with jQuery). Building this tool is part of my strategy of social media mechanization and trying to measure the value of blog, by ensuring that I’m reaching the right audience with my content. Each startup has examples of tools like the Bin and the Twitter game that are built out of necessity. And though they never receive the credit they deserve, such tools are force multipliers.

Pricing is taxation. A pricing plan taxes some element of a product’s use.  For a startup, choosing what to tax and how to tax it can be one of the most perplexing decisions because the tradeoffs between usage and revenue aren’t always clear. Activity based pricing or usage based pricing is one of the more common pricing plans in utility computing and software these days. Need to spin up another server immediately? Did another user sign up to use this software? No problem - we will just add it to your bill. ABP offers a few advantages, namely easy trial/low cost of failure, aligning cost with use and transparent pricing. The low cost of failure increases product trial rates. Also, the transparent and simple pricing builds trust with the buyer. These two advantages combine to reduce the need for sales intervention to convert a customer to paid. But activity based pricing does confer some costs. First, churn measurement is complicated. If a customer uses a product every third month, a standard monthly churn calculation will show the account churning and reactivating constantly, skewing the measurement. Second, building a sales team compensation plan for ABP is difficult because the value of the account can’t be measured at point of sale. Third, capacity planning can be challenging because a startup has reduced visibility into maximum capacity requirements. Last, ABP does ask the customer to make a new purchasing decision every billing period, instead of signing up for a year or some longer period of time. Every decision carries trade offs. ABP tends to foster account growth at the expense of revenue maximization and predictability.  Therefore, it’s common to see ABP at a product launch ($10 per active user per month) and then a slow trend toward standard pre-purchase licensing agreement either based on seats or capacity ($120 per user per year). Some examples: Amazon Web Services has created a hybrid of the two: a spot market for instances charged with ABP and a pre-purchase market where capacity can be bought for discounts of about 50%. Salesforce started as ABP before moving to annual seat contracts when churn rates became significant and revenue predictability faltered. Understanding the trade-offs of ABP and taxing the right things with your pricing plan is the key to balancing growth and revenue predictability.

Do social networks have a killer distribution or engagement advantage on Android that cannot be replicated on iOS because of Android’s openness? Will we see an Android-first social network of real scale in the near future? I think it’s a real possibility. Open platforms enable faster experimentation and more innovation than closed ones. New engagement models can be created, tested and refined much more easily on Android than iOS and Facebook’s newest mobile product could be that first example, despite its initial struggles. Chat Heads is a persistent messaging application that’s always present. If a friend messages you while you’re reading The Atlantic on Flipboard, you can respond without leaving the magazine app. Communication is the lifeblood of social networks and a social network maximizes its value by elongating session times, retaining users over the course of years and growing the network quickly. A persistent messaging application, that exists across application like Chat Heads, will no doubt boost those key metrics. Counterarguments abound for this idea but audience size isn’t one of them. For all intents and purposes, the number of iOS and Android users is roughly the same, greater than 500M. The main counterpoint is competition: Have existing networks including Skype, Facebook, Google Plus, and the litany of mobile first messaging companies with tens of millions of users like Line, Kik, MessageMe, Instagram, WhatsApp and SnapChat already sucked the oxygen out of the room? Another counterpoint is Android fragmentation, an issue Facebook is struggling with at the moment. It’s challenging to support the many versions of Android multiplied by the different device form-factors. What do you think? Could an Android first social network that uses the openness of the platform reach scale? Let me know on this Branch Follow me on Twitter

Feedback loops are essential components of every person’s role within a startup. The most recent and celebrated feedback loop is the viral coefficient or k-factor which Facebook applications optimize to grow their user bases. The [k-factor]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-factor_(marketing) , a borrowed concept from the study of biological viruses, measures the rate at which an application spreads through the network. But feedback loops don’t solely exist within marketing. For product teams, there is consumer feedback and user engagement metrics. For engineering teams, there’s technical performance. For sales teams, there are quotas, lifetime customer value and productivity per rep metrics. For marketing, there’s k-factor, paid marketing payback period, net promoter score and others. When we measure startups and businesses, we’re trying to detect when a sustainable positive feedback loop has been established and then pour as much gasoline into the growth engine as possible. At some k-factor, a Facebook app can achieve exponential growth results. Such growth is created when a large number of people invite friends to an app and a big-enough percentage of invitees convert to active users. The same principle holds true for a sales team. If a salesperson sells 10 times more in software than their monthly salary, a startup should hire as many salespeople as quickly as possible. If a product can catalyze an evangelical user base to drive more customers, then a startup should reinvest in the product and champion their evangelists. At a certain efficiency, feedback loops are powerful engines of growth. It stands to reason then that examining and optimizing each of these feedback loops is the keys to successful growth. When evaluating loops, consider three main characteristics: (i) the feedback latency or the time it takes to receive feedback (ii) the feedback potency or strength of the feedback loop and (iii) the feedback efficiency or amplification. Obviously, the best feedback loops, exhibit the shortest latencies, the highest potencies at the best efficiences; i.e. grow the business quickly in a very short period of time without much investment. But there aren’t very many of those! Viral loops tend to be have short latences. So do paid customer acquisition channels. Because of the relatively instant feedback afforded by these channels, we tend to invest more frequently in these loops. On the other hand, internal culture building, content marketing, community building and brand building have very long feedback latencies. It can take years for the dividends these investments to outstrip costs. But that doesn’t mean investing in long feedback loops isn’t worth the effort.  Branding, culture and word of mouth are some of the most valuable assets a company can build and investment in these long latency initiatives requires dedication and perseverance. Over the course of several years, the goal of a startup’s management team is to forge repeatable processes to grow the business. The best processes create and feed positive feedback loops. Take the time to enumerate the most important feedback loops in your business. Prioritize them, measure their latencies, potencies and efficiencies, fine tune them and repeat. Above all, don’t be afraid if some of those loops are longer latency than others. For some great reading creating, fostering and examining feedback loops, check out Thinking in Systems from MIT’s Donella Meadows. Follow me on Twitter here.

At first glance, SMB SaaS companies, those who sell Software-as-a-Service to small to medium businesses, may seem like any other software company. But they are quite a different breed. Successful SMB SaaS companies have reinvented their businesses eschewing the expensive enterprise sales model in favor of end-user centric marketing, support and product development. These businesses often look more like consumer startups than enterprise startups. It’s all because of the nature of the market. Market Dynamics SMB SaaS companies sell to a highly fragmented market. See the table below comparing the enterprise and SMB segments by number of firms, employees and payroll. Co. Size Firms in k Employees in M Payroll in $B Employees/Firm Payroll/Firm in $M 1 to 500 5,749 56.2 2,085 10 0.36 Greater than 500 17.5 58.2 2,771 3,326 158 Source: US Census There are about 17,500 enterprises with greater than 500 employees compared to 5.8M SMBs. The average traditional enterprise software company sells to firms with 3300 employees whose average payroll is $160M annually. On the other hand, SMB SaaS companies sell to firms with 10 employees and $400k in annual payroll. Clearly, these are two very different segments. Encouragingly, the market size for enterprise software is roughly equal to the market size for the SMB market: about 57M potential seats in each. Of course, the true number depends on the market segment: sales, HR, payroll, expense management, etc. Shifting from Customer Acquisition from Field Sales to Customer Support As a result of the fragmentation, SMB SaaS companies need to reach and market to 1,000 times more companies than their enterprise counterparts. Obviously this requires a new sales process. No White Papers; Just Mass Media Marketing Typically, this sales process leads with a product that excites users and triggers word of mouth sharing, and blog posts, and news articles. Direct sales, powered by quota carrying, relationship building salespeople, aren’t profitable at this scale. Instead, mass media channels must be used: press, mobile app stores (iOS & Android), web app stores (Chrome, Google Apps, Intuit and Force). Customer Support Becomes the Sales Team This huge number of customers imply every customer support rep must handle hundreds to thousands of customers per year instead of ones or tens of customers typical with enterprise focused companies. Customer support becomes an inside sales team. They drive upsells and cross-sells through webinars and blogging and support emails. End User Centric Development The product development cycle also differs. Without enterprise customers, there are no enterprise commitments. No promises to customers about releasing features on particular dates or paid upgrade cycles. It’s all subscription. Take it or leave it. Product Offers a 2 Step Value Proposition The most successful SMB SaaS products typically offer a 2 step value proposition: an initial value proposition to the end user and a longer term value proposition to a manager/decision maker. Expensify offers simple expense reports to the end user just by scanning receipts. To the controller/VP of Finance, Expensify offers better compliance with spend policies, a huge challenge for most companies of any scale. Similarly, Salesforce offered easier to use CRM to salespeople and better metrics for the sales manager. Yammer offers employees a better communication mechanism to end users and offered the IT department compliance controls. Product Closes the Loop and Reinforces the Efforts of Marketing and Support The end user value proposition drives press and word of mouth sharing. This increases marketing budget effectiveness. Effective SMB products also prequalify customers through the Product Qualified Lead. Know Thy Market By first appreciating the radically different nature of the SMB market and second by shaping the business to meet the demands of that market, startups serving SMBs can grow and scale and become hugely successful. But it all starts with a good understanding of the fragmented nature of the market.

We’ve all had a great idea for a product that would solve a pain we feel directly. It used to be impossible to convey that insight to anyone who might be in a position to act upon it. But that’s all changing because of the Internet. Of late, it’s becoming increasingly easier for consumers to share their ideas for great products and bring them to market. One great example of this is a company called Quirky which solicits ideas from a community of people all over the world. It refines the ideas, prototypes them, leveraging the insights of the community and then manufactures these products and sends them to retailers. Quirky solves many of the challenges in bringing products to market. I believe great product design and simple connectivity will be the defining principle of success for connected consumer products. For many products, connectivity to the Internet breathes magic into once static objects. That’s the vision behind one of Redpoint’s investments, Electric Imp. Combining the product design expertise of Quirky with the magic connectivity of Electric Imp enables regular people to dream of new ideas and work with Quirky and Electric Imp to create and bring these new inventions. Over the next few weeks, Electric Imp, Quirky and GE, all partners in innovation , will solicit ideas for connected devices and then work to build these products and bring them to market. If you have a great idea for a new connected product, submit your idea . You may see it on store shelves before the holidays!

As a founder, you’re always selling. You’re selling yourself, your team, your product, your company. But your pitch is likely missing one of two key components. A pitch needs to accomplish two goals to be effective. Most pitches solve the first, but omit the second. First, the pitch must convince the audience who might be investors, employees, recruits, or customers of some premise. Second, the pitch has to equip your champions, now convinced of your argument, to sell on your behalf. No enterprise software is ever bought unilaterally. No candidate is ever hired in isolation. No investment decision is ever made by one person in a VC firm. Whomever you’re pitching will need to convince another person or group of people. So your pitch should be structured to enable those champions to be effective by providing a be simple, relatable and intriguing argument to build momentum within whatever organization is making the decision whether a VC fund, a family or a business. How do you structure such an argument? One approach I’ve found that works well is a three pronged argument delivered in less than a minute. A change is inevitable, that change implies a big opportunity, and this is the right team or product to help us take advantage of that change. In your sales pitch, ideally at the end of the pitch, equip your champion with an argument like this. It will empower your champion to be more effective and help you close that sale.

Sitting on a bench overlooking the South Beach marina, I asked an entrepreneur how he had been since he founded his company. He replied with a conundrum: Looking back I can’t believe it’s only been a year but if I think about every day, it’s taken forever. That’s a really succinct way of communicating how it feels to grind. Cementing each brick, each hire, each line of code, each product feature seems like just an incremental step, just another day. But taking a step back and looking at the structure you’ve built as an entrepreneur, it seems to just fly by. Whenever I have a second thought about picking up today’s brick, I think of Thomas Edison who said “most people miss opportunity because it’s dressed up like hard work.” Here’s to the grinders.

Every SaaS business must decide how to charge for the service. Pricing plans are some of the most difficult decisions to make. Equally important to the price is determining the point at which the customer pays - the conversion point. There are  four different models that I’ve experienced: up front payment, freemium, limited free trials, money back guarantee. Picking the right one depends on a number of different factors. Below is a table that summarizes these four approaches. Pricing Model User Value Product Complexity End User Buys Avg Seat $ Freemium Increases with time Simple Yes or No Low Limited Free Trial Increases with time Complex Yes Low/Medium Up Front Payment Immediate Simple Yes High Money Back Guarantee Immediate Complex Yes High Freemium Freemium is a strategy for products whose value proposition is simply conveyed and whose value increases with time. Evernote’s value compounds with the data the user enters into the database. Expensify’s utility increases with the number of expense reporters on the system. Freemium businesses must target markets with very large user bases because the conversion to paid rates vary between 2 to 4%. To drive $50M in annual revenue at that conversion rate and $100/year subscription, you would need 17M users. Sometimes, the end users are buyers (typically in consumer services). Other times (for enterprise customers), end users are sales prequalifiiers who create a groundswell within an organization to convert to paid. Given enough users of a product in an organization, the enterprise can be up sold to a company wide license. Freemium distribution enables a company to acquire those users inexpensively. Limited Free Trial The main difference between freemium and trial products is product complexity: trial products are more complex and need time for the user to gain a deeper understanding of the value. CRM tools like Salesforce and 37Signal’s HighRise both use limited trials. The goal with these marketing mechanisms is to drive customers to explore the product for a brief period of time and then force a conversion. Allow too much time to pass and the customer will forget the value proposition. These kinds of products tend to require significant user behavior change so these products must market a promise and then use the conversion to paid event to enforce that behavior change (carrot + stick).  Because of the behavior change, these products are marketed to decision makers who select the software for their teams: product managers, tech leads and heads of sales. Many of the tests I’ve seen have indicated shorter trial periods are better: 7 days is better than 14 days is better than 30 days. Up Front Payment To pursue up front payment, you need an established brand with a clear value proposition and you sell the product to the end-user. Adobe’s Creative Suite is a canonical example. Customers know what the software can do and if they need it, customers will pay for it. The same is true for AutoCad, MS Office, and operating systems. Most of these products are high cost per seat products. Because they are well-known in the market, they command a price premium. Money Back Guarantee For products lacking an established brand, but offering an immediate value proposition and charging a high average seat value, there is no better solution than the money back guarantee. It mitigates the customers commitment phobia but establishes a billing relationship at the outset. This pricing strategy requires contact with a sales or account management team which implies a higher cost of sales. Ideally, higher conversion rates mitigate these costs. In other words, the up front commitment is a sales pre-qualifier. Your sales team will have fewer, higher quality leads. Plus, your sales team will have direct product feedback to share with the product team. Oracle offers this for many of their products as do Eloqua. While each product and target market have some unique attributes, consider the time to value, complexity of the product, product complexity and your sales model (freemium vs sales) when you do price your startup’s product.

In his Stanford GSB lectures, Peter Thiel spoke about secrets . But he defined secrets for startups in a different way than one might expect. A secret is not an unknown. Rather, it’s something just not widely believed to be achievable or feasible. In other words, it’s an insight, a thesis that isn’t widely held. Exploiting that secret should be the aim of every entrepreneur. Leveraging the secret means disruption and ultimately success. Before you start a company, find this kind of secret - an insight that will help you maximize leverage against your competitors and that doesn’t oppose strength with strength. How do you do that? I think about it like Judo. There are two basic tenets of judo: First: never to oppose strength with strength. Second: maximize leverage. You can’t compete with Google by building a better search engine. Google will put 100x the engineering team, leverage their 1,000x greater click data and out spend you on marketing by 10,000x. Don’t oppose strength with strength. Startups shouldn’t rely on more manpower, bigger ad budgets or data access advantages in fields where there is a large incumbent. During its infancy, Google won with distribution. Most internet companies believed search wasn’t valuable. Google thought differently. They offered to power all the major portals' search engines and eventually dethroned them. This was Google’s secret. The question, then, is what to leverage. Startups' advantage is speed which means they can explore new technologies (mobile apps, Node, Meteor, Cassandra, RedShift) which build better products, new distribution channels (mobile and tv app stores, virality, OpenGraph) which reach customers more cost effectively or novel product designs (Path, Dropbox, Expensify). Many companies are now using distribution as their secret - mobile app stores and Facebook Open Graph enable startups to access hundreds of millions of users in ways that incumbents simply aren’t prepared to leverage. Expensify uses mobile app stores to acquire hundreds of thousands of SMBs in ways that their market’s incumbent, Concur (market cap $3B), simply can’t copy. Find your secret and you’ll be well on your way to disrupting a huge market. NB: Thiel does mention other kinds of secrets. For example, PayPal’s financial losses due to fraud which are secrets in the traditional sense. It’s important to think about the judo principles when deciding whether to keep these secret. Simply put, if a competitor can gain leverage by using the secrets you disclose, keep them closely held.

There are three types of vision that a successful startup needs: product vision, business vision and team vision. Product vision is the dream. It’s how your company changes the world. It’s the problem that you’re solving and the solution to that problem. Product visions don’t end on launch day. They extend for years through the company’s growth. A product vision isn’t a certain feature or even a completed product. It’s the state of having solved a problem for a user or providing an experience for a user. The best product visions last for decades. Think Apple. Business vision is the go-to-market: it’s the way the product arrives in customers hands. Each company’s business vision is a unique. It might be a flavor of freemium. It might be enterprise direct sales. It could be viral ecommerce. But it’s not just a buzzword. It’s the process to mechanize the revenue engine for the company. Team vision is also called culture. Culture is the feeling of the workspace, the language in meetings and the values extolled by the company both internally and externally. Team vision also encompasses organizational structure - how the company is constructed to solve its customers problems. Exceptional founders possess all three kinds of vision. More often, founding teams forge these three visions by complementing each other’s strengths. Sometimes advisors or board members can help clarify visions. But it’s problematic for an outsider to engender them altogether because these visions are more than ideas or dreams. They must be present every day in every decision made, every feature built, every marketing message delivered. These visions must begin in the founding team or the management team. Of course, these visions may need to be tweaked with time if the market place impacts them, particularly product and business visions. A product might need to be redesigned to better suit meets customer needs. A distribution strategy may not work for a product because the ecosystem may have changed. But the essence of the vision shouldn’t change. When you build your startup’s team, look for co-founders who can transform those visions into reality.

When the core teams of a startup work in harmony, they create tremendous leverage for a business. I saw this last week with one startup I work with, Axial , a New York based company enabling private companies to access debt, equity capital and strategic acquirers. First, the marketing team created a powerful blog post and infographic, just top-notch content marketing . This campaign creates awareness among potential target customers who become curious about the service. Next, the product and engineering teams refine a product that welcomes users, organizes them into certain key segments and qualifies them for the sales team. Last, the sales team uses data collected by the product to inform and prioritize the sales processes improving close rates and customer satisfaction. Although I can’t share the data,  I can assure you that startup case studies like this one reaffirm Aristotle’s aphorism that the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts. It’s awesome to see a team working together, building harmony and driving a business forward.

Reference checks are part and parcel of the VC diligence process and most hiring processes. They are also one of the two most important analyses in hiring, next to the interview. Below, I’ve outlined my standard question set. I’m curious to hear feedback on what other questions or techniques might work. Types of References I find it’s valuable to speak to references who have worked with the candidate in different roles. Below is a list of typical roles in rank order. Peers provide fair feedback. They often competed or worked closely together and are often the most impartial checks. Managers offer the best insight on day-to-day interactions and work quality. Direct reports tend to be a bit more positive than others. But they provide insight about culture, team building and mentoring. Close colleagues are the least valuable checks. Friends at work don’t have much direct experience to share save for personality. Reference Check Outline Below is a list of questions prefaced by the rationale for the question. I’ll describe the referencer as the person I’m chatting with and the referenced as the person who I’m considering. Background questions provide context for the referencer. My goal is to understand the referencer’s background (technical/manager/etc) which informs the types of questions I can ask. I’m also looking to understand the referencer’s perspective on an organization. A sales manager will observe different characteristics than an engineer. Questions Where do you work? How long have you been there? What kinds of teams do you manage? Relationship questions establish the biases of the referencer toward the referenced. At this point, I’m also looking to establish whether referencer will provide a balanced reference. A skewed reference either entirely positive or exclusively negative is basically worthless and should serve only as a directional data point. Also, I look to establish the recency of the relationship. Questions: How do you know the person being referenced? How long did you work with them? How did you work together? How long ago? Work questions elucidate the type of work the referenced performed. I’m typically matching up the actual work to what the referenced has represented and also making sure it’s a fit for the role in case of a hire, or the sector, in case of an investment. Management experience is best examined here. Questions: What was the referenced’s role in the company? Could you share some examples of the kinds of work the referenced performed? Strengths should be matched to the demands of the role or company. These are self-evident. A PM should have good communication and management skills. Engineers should have relevant technical skills. Examples are critical here. Questions: Where does the referenced person shine? What kinds of work the referenced prefer to do? Complementary skills. Asking for weaknesses tends to put the referencer on the defensive, as if he or she is sharing something illicit. Instead, I ask the referencer the question below. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. And most jobs require teamwork. The best team members complement each other’s weaknesses. This is an indirect path at reaching the same answer. It doesn’t always work, but it’s my preferred route. I spend the most time of the interview on this question. Questions: What kinds of people does the referenced need around him/her to be successful? Influence. Understanding how a person is influenced is important. Everyone responds to a different approach. Some are very rational and respond to data. Others react to vision and passion. Still others might be consensus driven. Questions: How is the referenced persuaded or convinced? What kinds of motivation does he/she respond best to? Day-to-day personality. This line of questions aims at understanding the person’s culture in a work environment: serious, funny, team-oriented or individual contributor, darker or sunnier outlook. My purpose is to match working styles. Questions: What is it like to work with the referenced day-to-day? How would you characterize your typical interactions? Ethics is a checkbox question. It’s uncomfortable to ask but important to rule out any bad actors. Questions: Any questions of ethics? Social proof. Ask the referencer about their willingness to work with the referenced again. Questions: Would you hire or work with this person again? How highly do you regard this person? Top 25%, 10%, 5%, 1%? Suggestions? Do you have any suggestions or ideas for how to improve this outline? Or other tips on reference checks?

I have been writing for three years now and it’s been a ton of fun. I hope to continue to write for many more. Along the way so far, I’ve learned a few lessons on frequency, content type, idea generation, voice, titles and distribution. Frequency There are two schools of thought on blogging frequency: high frequency vs high quality. At this point, it’s unclear to me which is better for building an audience because both work. Each camp has its exemplars of success. In the frequency camp, Fred Wilson posts every day and I suspect this is because when he started seven years ago it was essential to write daily to train an audience to visit avc.com. Today social media (twitter, hacker news) generates most of the traffic for a blog by bubbling up the best content. Building a core audience that visits tomtunguz.com every day is important to me, but I post every day because each writing book I’ve read recommends it. And I figure if I’m writing a blog post, I may as well publish it. I write sometime between 5 and 7am each morning when it’s quiet and I can focus. Flights are also good times for blogging. Representing the other point of view, Chris Dixon and Paul Graham pen monthly essays and posts which are better revised and often succinct, witty and always very well written. This technique concentrates engagement, maximizes social media reach and ensures great content. Content Type I never can predict with much accuracy which content will resonate with readers who tend to be startup founders and employees. But the most successful posts tend either to create an emotional connection through a personal story or share some detailed tactical advice.  The best posts enable readers to see a reflection of themselves in the story because they have or are living through something similar. Reading and dissecting classic novels and well written magazine articles helped me begin to understand how other authors do this well. Burt Helm from Inc magazine shared this GQ article about Suicide Catchers in China as a great example of storytelling. One example of a successful emotional/storytelling post is “The Biggest Challenge of My Professional Career: Communication” And “Your Startup’s 10 Most Important Metrics” is example of a very tactical post that readers enjoyed. Ideas Writing every day demands lots of ideas. I jot down notes during conversations, sift through my calendar, read the news, and examine what’s trending on social media. Sometimes, I don’t have any ideas and to jog a stream I search for a strong opinion or reaction I’ve had recently. That seems to help breaking my writer’s block. I keep a list of these ideas in draft blog posts. Sometimes I just jot down a title and other times it’s a jumble of ideas. Then I’ll go back the next day or in a few days to complete the content and edit the post. At any given time, I’m working on 3 or 4 drafts. I might hold onto a draft/idea for a month or two to let it mature a bit so I can better express it or gather examples. After a few weeks of practicing, storing and retaining ideas becomes part of a daily routine. Nevertheless, some days, I feel like I’m wading through mud to write a few paragraphs. Voice Blog readers respond to strong individual voices. A blog shouldn’t resemble the Economist or the New Yorker whose editorial teams use style guides to ensure a consistent tone which is larger than any individual writer. The whole point of a blog is to hear a real human voice. It’s something I forget sometimes so I try to write the first draft the way I might speak and edit that output. Hemingway is my inspiration for human tone. Titles Titles matter. I spend lots of time on my titles but I didn’t always which was a big mistake. Looking back through the first year or so of my blog titles, I can see now they were awful. Here’s an early one: “Binary pointillism - the intersection of Seurat and Felton.” Barf. Who wants to read that? It sounds like a dissertation. Dan Shipper taught me the best titles read like tweets. My goal is to drive as many retweets as possible so I shouldn’t ask the user to construct an interesting tweet on my behalf. Instead, I should make it easy for the reader to just hit a button and share something interesting. I often write the title as the last step. It’s easier after having written the conclusion to summarize the point in 140 characters or fewer. Distribution Once I post, I tweet the post, submit the post to Quibb and Hacker News. Then I monitor the reactions. If after 45 minutes, I don’t see many retweets or much engagement, I’ll try another title or two. Sometimes the post is to blame, but more often, I haven’t allured the reader with the right title. One blogger recommended ignoring the Google Analytics and Feedburner stats to me. I find that it helps quite a bit not to be so metrics focused. Then I’m not so concerned about the daily fluctuations but more on monthly stats, which is a better indicator of success. Nevertheless, I still haven’t figured out how best way to measure the success of this blog . Patience Honestly, it takes forever to build a blog that people know or read about or care about. For some, the reader base grows much much quicker than it did for me. Nevertheless building any kind of brand on the web through content or otherwise is a slow, incremental process. Every once in a while, I’ll reach the front page of Hacker News or spike on LinkedIn and I get an increase in readership. But it takes patience. I find the more content I have produced, the more the blog pays dividends. Most of my posts are evergreen, timeless, so they appear in Google searches or are randomly resurrected in social media from time to time, rediscovered through some stroke of luck. Ultimately, blogging helps me refine my thinking and share it with people who are interested or curious. I hope this post helps motivate you to write. h/t to Stefano Bernardi @stefanobernardi, who inspired this post.

Below is my general outline for a typical diligence process. First meeting When I’m meeting a startup for the first time, my goal is to understand as much about the business and team as I can. Founders/Team: How do the founders know each other? How do they interact with each other? Are they passionate? How qualified are they? What would it be like to work with them? Business : In some form, I walk through the Business Model Generation framework: value proposition, key activities, key partners, major assets, channels of distribution, customer segments, cost structure and revenue streams. Is the problem worth solving and if the startup succeeds, how valuable would it be? Go to market : Can the company articulate their value proposition simply? Can the team explain how they will go to market? Do they have a good understanding of the competition? The angle : What secret, what insight has the founding team made that the rest of the market hasn’t yet realized? What discontinuity in the market can they leverage to win large share? After the first meeting After a startup has left and I’m “doing diligence,” I want to test some of the assertions made by the company. Market Size Validation : The first thing is to verify market size and whether it foots with the data the company presented. Then, I try to dig deeper into the nuances of the market. How concentrated is the market? What kinds of moves are the incumbents making and how they change the market? How might a startup disrupt this market? Pitch-it-myself test : I stop a few partners in the office and give them the pitch to test their reactions. I do the same with my wife. In a sense, I’m getting their cursory opinions and some skewed market feedback, but I’m also testing the pitch, the go-to-market and the top level attractiveness of the company. It helps me think through a lot of the business and test my assumptions. Six degrees of separation . I look up the founders on LinkedIn, send a few emails for references and then wait to hear back on some initial reference calls. Second and third meetings Follow up meetings are dedicated to metrics and the future. Pipeline : Let’s get to brass tacks and some numbers. How many customers/users? How often are they using it? What are CAQ, LTV and churn metrics? How do those compare with industry benchmarks? Product roadmap : I know it’s early and hard to forecast, but I’m looking to be convinced the founder has a good sense of where the company is going and why. Financing plan : What are the major buckets of expenditures? How do they change over time? Is the revenue plan reasonable? What are the key metrics for the business? Industry : I’ll call a few friends in the industry who can help me better understand the dynamics in the sector. Additional meetings/Full partner meeting At this point, I’m really interested and I’m trying to understand the investment risks better. Key issues analysis : After a founder has met several partners, I gather questions and dig deeper to answer them as best I can. If I don’t have the material to answer the questions, I diligence some more: data, reference calls, and more meetings. After the term sheet: After the term sheet is signed, the lawyers step in. Legal diligence :  I’m interested in learning how well formed the company is, if there are skeletons in the closet like fired co-founders or large debts or consultants who are owed shares or pending lawsuits. I’m also curious to see how a founder negotiates (though this comes through after the term sheet has been issued). Each fund raising process is unique. Sometimes investors will have deep experience in a sector or know the team very well both of which can accelerate the process significantly. But I hope this general outline sheds light on the key steps and questions answered in the fund raising process.

Once you have built your product and it’s in the market, there are only three things that matter: distribution (getting the product into users' hands), engagement (validating that you’ve built the right product and that users are using it), and monetization (making money from those engaged users). Some companies call this the 3 Rs: reach, retention and revenue. Whatever you call it, this is your strategy. At board meetings, I’ve started categorizing each portfolio company’s roadmap items into these three buckets. It’s a simplification that immediately reveals the priorities of the company at any stage. Is most of the product development focused on growth or new product features that drive engagement? How have those priorities changed over time? Where are most of our people allocated? Are these priorities the right ones given the stage of the company? Breaking strategy into these three parts makes it easy - you now have a template, a stencil for describing your strategy. Make a table that looks like this: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Distribution Engagement Monetization Fill it in with the top 2 to 3 initiatives per quarter. You have just built a board-level roadmap that describes your strategy. Explain it to your board, solicit feedback, then hold a town hall and describe it to your team. Then get back to building your company!

Some of our companies started financing processes in earlier this quarter. At a strategy session with one of our companies, the team and I crafted the outline of the pitch deck. They asked me what questions a venture investor might ask in the initial meeting. Distilling the investment analysis into a small number of general questions is challenging because of the diversity of businesses we see but, I gave it a try and came up with the following questions I might ask a startup to answer in an initial meeting. [Value prop] What is the problem and is it worth solving? Why is now the right time to solve it? [Team] Does the team have the vision and the wherewithal to build this company? [Go to market] What is the competitive angle (competitive barrier to entry and/or go-to-market) that will enable this company to succeed where others have tried and failed? [Sales effectiveness & product validation] Who does the startup sell to? Which customers have used the product and how have they received it? How much is each customer worth? [Product distribution] How does the company acquire customers cost effectively?  What are the unit economics (customer acquisition cost, contribution revenue, and churn rates)? [Revenue model] Does the company have the revenue model to build a big (>$100M annual revenue) business with good margins (gross ~ 50 to 60% / net ~15 to 25%) under reasonable assumptions? [Market size] Can the market enable or bear a $100M revenue Alternatively, is this product in a quickly growing market or riding a disruptive wave? Other risks including legal risks, technology development risks, value chain implications and so on may also be important . But when building a generic fund-raising deck, answering these questions in your pitch deck will serve as a solid starting point. It’s important to unite these points with a single theme or story to sell the dream.

Though the industry is called venture capital, the goal of a VC isn’t to maximize every risk. Instead, we try to understand all the risks a business might face and weigh those risks with the reward - the exit. Here are the major risks that I typically review when a startup pitches. Market timing risk - Is now the right time for the business? It’s often hard to evaluate this risk, but nevertheless, it’s an important consideration. There are many stories of people saying I invented Facebook before Facebook, which may very well be true. But the market just wasn’t yet ready for it. Business model risk - Is there a clear business model? Do the unit economics seem to work? If not, what are the assumptions required to achieve profitability? Market adoption risk - Are there strong competitive players in the market? What are the major barriers to entry? Market size risk - If the company is successful, is the exit scenario large enough to provide the types of returns our fund needs ? Execution risk - Does the team have the right skills and passion to reach their goals? If not, are they amenable to finding others to complement their skills? Technology risk - Does the company have to develop a new technology that may not reach fruition, or may take much longer than expected? This is typically more prevalent in cleantech and hardware companies. Capitalization structure risk - does the company have enough room in the cap table to take more investment necessary to grow while still ensuring employees and executives are well compensated? Platform risk - Is the startup building atop YouTube, Twitter or Facebook? How strong is their relationship? Are their product plans in the direct path of the platform or complementary? Venture management risk - Is the company receptive to feedback? Is the team candid about the state of the business? Financial risk - How much money does the company require to achieve its goals? Is the financing risk manageable given the current environment and company trajectory? Legal risk - Does the company have a high likelihood of lawsuit for patent or copyright infringement? Does the company have any outstanding complaints with early employees or founders? Are there regulatory challenges involved in this sector? The list of these risks applies differently to each startup, but it’s a good general outline for entrepreneurs to think through when they pitch their companies to VCs.

When deciding if to raise a venture round, it’s critical to ensure your venture investor shares the vision for the company: both the product roadmap and the financial goals of the company. Most founders never consider the impact on fund size on VC motivations. As long as there are enough reserves to invest as the company grows, a founder might think, that’s fine with me. But this is naive. Fund sizes dictate a VC’s strategy. To achieve their target returns, a $50M fund and a $500M fund must pursue very different investment and management styles. Let’s take a look at the economics of two hypothetical funds, a $50M and a $500M fund. Assuming each fund seeks to return three times the capital invested in 10 years to provide a good return for investors, the total value of the portfolios must be $150M and $1,500M respectively. The funds have different target ownerships and therefore different average investment sizes. All this boils down to a target value of a company at exit. The larger the fund, the larger the exits must be for the venture investors to be successful. $50M fund $500M fund Target return multiple 3 3 Implied Portfolio Holding Value $150M $1,500M Average Ownership 10% 25% Total Market Cap of Portfolio $1,500M $6,000M Avg Investment Size including reserves 2.5M $10M Number of Investments per Fund 20 50 Company Failure Rate 50% 70% Successful Investments 10 15 Avg Market Cap of Exit $150M $400M The smaller fund a $150M exit fits the model. It’s a great outcome. But the same can’t be said for the larger fund, which seeks exits three times larger. VCs understand this math - it’s the same calculations they use to pitch potential investors. But it’s equally important founders understand the motivations and the goals of their investors, to ensure both are aligned. Larger funds will push companies to pursue larger exits. When raising capital, ensure that your investors share the same vision and commitment to the product, but also verify that your target outcomes for the business are in the same ballpark and that you both define success in the same terms.

With the analytics tools today, it’s easy to measure hundreds if not thousands of different metrics for your business. Cutting through all the chaff to determine the most important or insightful metrics can be quite a challenge. Below are the ten metrics I’ve found to be most useful in board meetings. They answer the questions of how should a startup founder might measure the business at the highest level. You should have many more metrics than these, but I’ve highlighted the ones that I recommend presenting to your board and reviewing each week. Metrics Format Clear data leads to productive conversations.  To best understand a data point and its implications, we have to put it in context. I’ve found dividing top level data in three slides, one for company priority (Distribution, Engagement, Revenue) helps to set the right context. Within the slide, a table that shows the metric and compares it to last month, then explicitly calculates the monthly change, the trailing six month average and finally compares the metric to the goal best communicates the state of that metric. See below for an example. Metric This month Last Month % change TSM Average Goal Active Users 100,000 50,000 100% 125% 75% Total User Base 500,000 400,000 25% 7% 10% The TSM Average column is the Trailing Six Month Compound Growth Rate. It is calculated in this way: (ending_value/starting_value)^(1/(num_periods-1))-1. In most businesses, a monthly growth percent is too volatile to be meaningful. However the TSM Average smooths out the monthly change. Comparing the monthly to the TSM, we can get a sense of whether the monthly growth is accelerating or decelerating and how it compares to the goal you set each quarter. In this example, the total user growth accelerated this month and activity is way up. The next question, the one board members and founders should ask, is why? Metrics/Question Pairs Now that we have the base format of the metrics, let’s talk about which metrics matter. Each metric is followed by the question it’s designed to answer. Pick the ones that are relevant to your business. Distribution New users added last month by channel/TSM growth rate: How are well are we growing the user base? Which user sources are the best? Total user base/TSM growth rate: How important is our monthly growth compared to our total user base? Cost of customer acquisition, lifetime value, pay back period: Can we grow faster through paid acquisition? Are we acquiring customers profitably? How much can we afford to spend on new customers? How is this changing over time? Engagement Active users (can defined in several different ways depending on your product) by channel/TSM growth rate: Are we getting better at giving our customers what they want/need? Which channels of users are most effective in finding us the right kind of user? % of users using top 3 key features in a given month: Are our product initiatives the right ones? Revenue Revenue / TSM Revenue growth: Are we growing our revenue? Conversion to paid rate in that month/by cohort: How many users converted to paid? Are we improving our ability to convert customers to paid? Avg spend per paying customer of a managed account vs solo account: What is the impact of the account management team? Churn rate/ TSM Churn rate: How well do we retain our customers? Burn rate: When are we profitable? When do we run out of cash? When do we need to raise? These are the metrics that have been most valuable/insightful for me working with our companies. Let me know if there are other metrics you use to measure your business that might be useful to add to this list on this Branch .

If at any time in the past ten years, you might have asked someone at Intuit about the size of the QuickBooks user base, they would have told you the same number: about 4M. This figure hasn’t grown because Intuit’s customer base, the small-and-medium business market, is a leaky bucket. On the small end of the spectrum, about 750,000 businesses are created each year and about the same number fail. On the upper end of the spectrum, successful medium sized businesses (and the larger, more valuable Quickbooks customers) outgrow Intuit’s products and upgrade to enterprise accounting packages provided by Oracle and others of their ilk. It’s no surprise then that QuickBooks suffers from high churn rates, characteristic of the SMB market. This leaky bucket market dynamic can be quite unattractive if customers must be acquired through paid customer acquisition. SMBs are notoriously expensive to acquire. Combined with high churn rates, we have a recipe for burning through mounds of cash. Despite those concerns, it’s difficult to argue with Intuit’s success. It’s nearly a $20B market cap company generating $4.2B annually in revenue of which 17% or $700M+ is derived from this leaky bucket SMB segment. So how did Intuit build a business of such scale atop a customer segment that looks like quicksand? They don’t pay to acquire customers. Intuit used word of mouth, brand strength and an existing product (Quicken) to bootstrap QuickBooks to success. Today, it’s easier than ever for startups to target the SMB market successfully. Freemium businesses of scale are feasible because mobile application distribution, web distribution (SEO, social media) and app stores like Intuit or Salesforce or Google amass millions of SMB owners who can be reached at zero marginal cost. But very few startups and investors pursue the market even today despite these fundamental changes in the market. Part of the challenge is maintaining the discipline to minimize customer acquisition spend, instead focusing on brand building , word of mouth marketing, product excellence and so on. In other words, patience. In the next five years, I think we will see a segment of SMB SaaS companies achieving very large exits. And though their customers bases will suffer the same leaky bucket economics as Intuit, the customer acquisition strategies afforded to and created by these startups will trump those challenges.

Over the past few weeks, there has been a new refrain among consumer mobile startups that I’ve met with: we’re designing for normal people or normals as Chris Dixon would put it . There are a few reasons for this trend. First, there is a movement towards great design. Second, there is a wave to reinvent and reimagine core applications of the mobile phones. The apps shipped with the standard OS were ports of their desktop counterparts. Only now, after using these cloned applications for a while, do we understand how email, phone, calendar, etc should evolve. Third, machine learning technologies make magical experiences possible like priority inbox or Google Now. But, developing a product for a different segment demands a different approach. First, alternate customer acquisition techniques are required. Unlike productivity nuts whose unrelenting persistence of even minor time savings drives product experimentation and usage, normals discover products by chance or through word of mouth. Large scale distribution deals like carrier bundling, embedding in the operating system and mass media channels seem to me to be much more effective for reaching this audience. Additionally, the value proposition must be clear, simple and immediate. Normals have far less patience. In other words, this user segment demands better designed applications. Last, the user feedback from productivity nuts and normals will vary dramatically. The first will demand ever more sophisticated features and integrations while the second will oppose functionality in pursuit of simplicity. Picking anything in between will develop a product that fails to meet either need well. Product must clearly prioritize one’s segments needs. The opportunity for startups targeting normals is massive. But approaching the market requires a new mindset, different product prioritization and alternate marketing tactics. In what other ways must startups serving normals evolve? Join us on this Branch.

You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is “never get involved in a land war in Asia” There is a land war being fought on the web and it’s for files and filesystems. Incumbents and startups alike are duking it out. And things are really starting to get interesting. The startups, Dropbox and Evernote, reinvented the file system as a synchronized, cross platform file system abstracting the hardware and the data. Now they are moving up the stack. Dropbox’s acquisition of Mailbox and renewed focus on photographs and attachments and Evernote’s every growing battery of point applications like Skitch, Food, Hello and Peek aim to drive further file creation and user engagement within their notebooks. The incumbents, Microsoft and Apple, leverage their own advantages heavily.  Over the last few years, Microsoft and Apple, which own the most popular operating systems and the content creation applications, Microsoft Office and Apple iWork, have persistently revised their operating systems to unify the local and cloud filesystems (SkyDrive and iCloud). Google entered the fray seeking to displace Office with a web based document creation suite whose by-product was an online file system that evolved into Drive. Google’s recent Keep launch, a note taking application, is a shot across Evernote’s bow. Along the way, the core value proposition to users has changed. The old war cry, liberation from disaster recovery and data backup duties, has been replaced by the promise of device independent, scalable, searchable filesystems that use the power of the cloud to afford new capabilities. On Google Drive, searching for Eiffel Tower will return photographs from a user’s of the famed Parisian monument using image recognition. Because end user applications and experiences differentiate these filesystems, I expect to see a flurry of acquisitions of next generation content creation tools that users love by these companies all in effort to create loyalty and build lock-in to a particular file system. These might include photo creation tools, next generation presentation tools, developer API platforms enabling programmatic access to these file systems and potentially even content stores to compete with Google Play and iTunes. After all, movies and music and books also have to be stored in a file system. It may as well be the same one. For users the promise of the cloud filesystems battle is better applications and experience. For startups, it means the beginning of the M&A wave. Which startups do you think are most likely to be acquisition targets in the file system wars? Let me know what you think on this Branch.

An entrepreneur shared this quote with me a few weeks ago. The future is already here – it’s just not evenly distributed. William Gibson, quoted in The Economist, December 4, 2003 I remembered it this morning when I drove past a Google self-driving car and then again a few minutes later when a Tesla whipped past me and a third time during the same commute when I dictated an email to my mobile phone. Sometimes living in the Bay Area does feel like the living in future. But to Gibson’s point, not every region can claim to have self-driving cars on its highways or electric car ownership or smart phone penetration rates as high as the Bay Area. Why not? I think there are four main barriers to distributing the future better. These are the same four challenges startups must solve to succeed. And these needs actually determine the structure of most startups. Awareness: many people simply don’t know about Square or Expensify or Google Now. They haven’t seen or used the products because they’re too busy or otherwise engaged. Marketing and branding are the tools to drive education and awareness. Cost: new technologies cost money. With time and advances in manufacturing or cloud computing, newer technologies become more efficient to produce and deliver, but money will always be a barrier to adoption. Complexity: my father-in-law is a brilliant surgeon and audiophile. We’ve just set up Sonos in his living room with Pandora and Rdio and a bunch of other music services. This weekend, I walked him through the set-up step by step over the phone and hearing him narrate the experience I realized how challenging technology can be for those who aren’t digital natives. Even though those three products, Sonos, Pandora and Rdio are known for their simplicity, for many user they still aren’t simple enough. Complex product design limits adoption. That’s what Apple and Google do so well and why they attract hundreds of millions of users. Perceived value: for a long time the benefits of newer technologies aren’t appreciated even after a customer/user might be aware. Either the cost/benefit analysis isn’t strong enough or the need isn’t yet apparent to the end user. These four limits align well with the four major parts of a startup: Awareness is Marketing . Cost is Engineering . Complexity is Product Design . Perceived Value is Sales . A startup succeeds when it distributes the future better - and that means aiding awareness, reducing cost, eliminating complexity and selling the value of their product.

Steve Sinofsky, executive at Microsoft for 24 years penned an insightful post on the five data biases plaguing product decisions. It can be easy for any founder, product manager, marketer or engineer accept a data point at face value as the rationale behind a decision. But understanding the nuances and biases of the data, questioning the data, is often just as important as the result. The corollary point argued in his post is data isn’t strategy - data can’t be blindly used to inform product design and decision making because the data might be “lies, damned lies and statistics”. Steve highlights five data biases seen often in his career: Representation. No data can represent all people using (or who will use) a product. So who was represented in the data? Forward or backward looking.  When looking at product usage, the data looks at how the product was used but not how it will be used down the road (assuming changes).  Is the data justifying the choice or informing the e
choice? Contextual. The data depends on context in which it is collected, so if the user interface is sub-optimal or drives a certain pattern the data does not necessarily represent a valid conclusion.  Did the data consider that the collection was itself flawed? Counter-intuitive. The data is viewed as counter-intuitive and does not follow the conventional wisdom, so something must be wrong.  How could the data overlook what is obvious? Causation or correlation. With data you can see an end state, but it is not always clear what caused the end-state.  If something is used a lot, crashes a lot, or is avoided there might be many reasons, most not readily apparent or at least open to debate, that cause that end-state.  Is the end-state coincident with the some variables or do those variables cause the end-state? In my day to day, the correlation or causation one is most common. When evaluating a businesse’s performance it’s easy to assume that one metric (new feature release) causes another to increase (engagement) but making that leap isn’t always correct. Which data biases do you encounter most often? Tell me in this Branch .

In social media, like the real world, there’s quite a lot of gossip going on behind your back. At least on the Internet, you can measure it. Dubbed dark social, this “invisible” sharing brings 40% of the visitors to my blog and similar amounts of traffic to other content sites. The Atlantic Monthly, which receives 5M monthly uniques, reports 60% of traffic from dark social Like its distant cousin dark energy, dark social is a massive and to date little understood force despite its importance. Dark social clicks originate from instant messages, emails containing links and links embedded in tweets opened in TweetDeck among other sources. Google Analytics buckets dark social as direct navigation, incorrectly assuming these users spontaneously typed a long url from some epiphany. But as marketer Cody Boyte from Axial showed me last week, It is possible to approximate dark social traffic with Google Analytics. No Large Hadron Collider needed. To create a filter for dark social traffic, Log into Google Analytics and click on the Advanced Segment button. Create a new segment called Dark Social that excludes the landing page that exactly matches “/” and the Source contains (direct). Below is a screenshot of the filter. To view more help on Advanced Segments click here. This Advanced Segment will track all the visitors who arrived at your site with click to deep link without ever visiting the home page: Dark Social traffic. How important is Dark Social traffic for your site? Let me know on this Branch.

During the life of a startup, the question of outsourcing can arise frequently whether for PR, marketing, product design, sales or engineering. Outsourcing can be very attractive: consultants bring new points of view, relevant experience and (potentially) immediate results. Of course, consultants charge high fees and after their contract expires they leave with their knowledge and insights in tow. Founders may be challenged when deciding when and what to outsource. To simplify the decision, reflect on your startup’s key competencies needed to win your market. Like people, startups must focus on a few key skills to be successful. Typically, startups win share by focusing on their strength: product design, sales effectiveness, marketing deft or technology advantages. Startups never should outsource their main advantage or the skill required to win in the market. If a team of founders believes product design will revolutionize mobile social networking, the team would blunder to outsource that design. Instead, the startup must cultivate a team to master that discipline. Other terrible candidates for outsourcing include long term projects without clear success metrics. The high churn rates of the PR industry reflect this reality. Most PR firms strive to win business, work diligently for a few quarters and then wane as ideas for stories become exhausted and new clients arrive. In my experience, hiring PR firms for particular launches and events works well. Otherwise, anointing an internal storyteller and empowering that person to achieve long term goals achieves success more reliably and at less cost. Startups should leverage consultants for narrowly defined, non-core initiatives when developing an expertise isn’t valuable to the business. For example, AirBnB didn’t need to build an internal team of cameramen to photograph the insides of homes all over the world. Consultants offer tremendous leverage to a business and work best when tasked with ancillary, commodity services not required by a startup to win their market. What are your lessons from outsourcing? Join the conversation on Branch.

In a world of socially curated news, there is no place for RSS. I wrote last year: Social streams solve the problem most RSS readers faced: the inbox with 1000+ items to read and no way to sift through them. Socially curated news syndicated through social networks (Facebook, Twitter) and content networks (LinkedIn, Quibb, HackerNews)  solves the relevance problem that RSS never could address. Brian Shih, former Google Reader PM, wrote an excellent, passionate post-mortem on the product on Quora , where he underscores the importance of the social forces at play on Google Reader. I think the reason Google always wanted to pull the Reader team off to build these other social products was that the Reader team actually understood social … But after switching the sharing features over to G+ (the so called “share-pocalypse”) along with the redesigned UI, my guess is that usage just started to fall - particularly around sharing. To succeed as a content producer or as a content consumption product, embracing and mastering social proof and sharing is critical. Ignore these forces at your peril. Google Reader wasn’t the first to fall at the hands of social distribution nor will it be the last. Unless Google Reader is wholly reinvented with social proof and sharing at its core, any effort to extend Google Reader’s life is only a temporary stay of execution.

How much is the most valuable brand in the world, Coca-Cola worth? $77.8B. That’s 45% of the company’s market cap. Often times, winners create advantages in a market through brands. These brands evoke emotions within consumers: feelings of trust (Visa), of aspiration (Nike), of adventure (RedBull). And if the brand is strong enough, it replaces the generic term: tissues/Kleenex, internet search/Google, glass cleaner/Windex. In Silicon Valley, we tend to believe that better products win markets. It’s atypical to overhear a conversation at Blue Bottle Coffee or at YCombinator about brand building - brand attributes, values, positioning. Instead, our exchanges focus more on technology and more recently, design. But over the next several years, marketing, branding and positioning, all under-appreciated disciplines in the valley will become markedly more important. As barriers to entry continue to fall driven by cloud technologies, competition among startups will increase and the startups that reach their target customer bases with the best messaging, building the most effective brands, will win. We know storytelling will be the differentiator. Look at every commodity industry to see the value of branding. Nike makes running shoes. Kleenex manufactures tissues. But they each sell something else - they sell an idea. Nike sells excellence: “Just Do it.” Kleenex sells “taking care of family.” It’s logical that cash conscious startups should limit their investment to measurable marketing tactics. But as startups scale and as technologies commodify faster and faster, branding building investments should become a key part of the marketing efforts of the business. Ultimately, the brand may become half the value of the company and the true differentiator in the market place. That’s nothing to sneeze at.

I believe machine learning will drive the next big wave of innovation in consumer web services. The very same technologies that power Google’s search and Netflix video recommendation engine will become far more common and useful, perhaps even predominant in the consumer web. Every great consumer product has a little bit of magic. Apple employs static software and hardware design to anticipate user needs - to create that magic. Compared to user experience design and forethought, intelligence, when it works, is far more compelling and impressive. Most of the time though, it’s easy to be disappointed. If you’re anything like me, the first time you played with Siri, you tried to find places where it failed. We expect and to a degree have been trained to expect the technology to fail. Like Dorothy, we all look behind the curtain to find the little man making the magic, the Mechanical Turk. But ML and deep learning have reached a point that makes it harder and harder to pull back the curtain and expose weak technology. Google and Nuance speech recognition are truly useful because they work with very high degrees of accuracy. Netflix’s content recommendation, Facebook’s EdgeGraph, LinkedIn recommendations, Twitter’s Discover, Google Now - each one of these products improves every day. For machine learning to create magic the the technology requires large amounts of data, the infrastructure to process the data and the algorithms to extract learning. The data sets relevant to consumer products are the data sets consumers create themselves: watch lists, click streams, intent to buy expression, and sharing patterns. And with the growth of smart phone penetration and tablet growth and time spent on the web and identity systems, more and more of human interaction with services and with others is recorded (for better or worse). These data sets grow at exponential rates on an individual basis improving the predictive ability for each user. Second, the infrastructure to process the data is readily available. Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and others have open sourced Hadoop, Cassandra, Storm and other data processing systems that run on commodity infrastructure and scale horizontally. These systems are capable of analyzing data at close to the rates that users produce them. Last, the combination of huge amounts of data available and the infrastructure to process it opens the doors to deep learning . This finally makes possible techniques like artificial neural networks which were previously constrained by lack of processing capacity. In the next five years, machine learning will appear in everything from books to dating sites, from travel recommendations to insurance quotes. And opening the doors below the chess board, there won’t be a chess grand master masquerading, but a data center.

Among my friends in college, a frequent response to the question, “How’s it going?” was “Strikes and gutters.” In other words, really well and really poorly - at the same time. Five years into the venture business, I think that expression is much better suited to the day-to-day swings a startup experiences than the life of a college student. It’s hard to imagine these two diametric feelings at the same time, but for entrepreneurs it’s a daily occurrence. Launch a new great product feature but lose a big customer. Grow really fast but struggle with fund raising. Get a lot of great press but fire an under-performer. At the beginning of most startups, there are more gutters than strikes, more down days than up days. And over the life of the startup, each day presents an opportunity to start changing the ratio from mostly gutters and one or two strikes, to one strike per gutter and so on. Hard work, smart thinking and perseverance can win you that perfect game. Keep your head up after a few gutter balls. And celebrate your strikes. The most important part of the journey is to relentlessly pursue those pins.

I often wonder about how to measure the success of this blog. While there are many tools to measure page views and visitors, the absolute number of readers is probably the worst measure because it’s a false idol. Feedburner subscribers, retweets, time on site aren’t much better because they don’t measure the true performance of a blog - what fraction of an audience the blog reaches. In order for content marketing and blogs to be effective, the writing must have a target audience in mind. By focusing on that audience, bloggers build a brand in a scalable and cost-effective way. So engaging the very highest fractions of that audience possible is the best metric of success. For example, this blog targets startup founders, managers and employees. I journal my education and thoughts in the hopes that others benefit from these learnings. In exchange, I’m trying to build recognition within the startup ecosystem. Each morning, I’d like to log into an analytics dashboard that showed me the fraction of entrepreneurs and startup employees I reached the day before. Alas, there is no such tool. But there should be because this need is common across all commercial blogs. Expensify and Stripe use blogs to recruit engineers and others to work for them. OkCupid and Mint used wit and data to attract singles and penny-pinchers. Axial leverages data and financial market trends to engage bankers . None of these companies can measure their reach within their target audience. At this point, identity systems have become sophisticated enough to uniquely identify visitors. LinkedIn, with a real identity platform and a content distribution system, is best positioned to provide these kinds of insights. Elsewhere, privacy concerns abound and until publishers and users can resolve this problem in some way, blogging measurement remains in the dark. What tools do you use to measure the success of your blog? Tell me on Branch

The three tier feature based pricing model is so common it’s almost a cliché. For some businesses it works well. But as Kenny van Zant explained to me, feature based pricing can slow growth in freemium businesses in two ways: first, feature based pricing creates incentives within a company to offer a subpar product and consequently creates unnecessary friction in the adoption process slowing growth. Both of these challenges arise when the pricing model is applied to end users, instead of the right target, the manager. Freemium businesses disrupt incumbents by dramatically reducing the costs of customer acquisition. Instead of a single step top down enterprise sales process, freemium businesses break the sales process into two parts: community building and prequalified close. By granting free access to a great product, a freemium business develops a community of evangelists within an organization that foster demand for a product. This demand will eventually convince a manager to purchase the product on behalf of the team goaded by the social proof of a large fraction of employees using the product. Freemium businesses rely on a top-notch product to attract users but feature based pricing plans can undermine that strategy. Imagine a successful bottoms-up freemium SaaS business. The product team has built a great new feature that will drive engagement and delight users. They speak with the marketing team about the launch. The marketing team, whose ambition is to drive up-sells to  higher pricing tiers, will push the product team to release the great new feature only for the most expensive tier to entice upgrades. Since most businesses, even SMB SaaS businesses follow the 80/20 Pareto rule, where the majority of revenue is generated by a small minority of customers, this marketing decision restrics the great new feature to a small subset of the user base. The compelling product that formerly drove bottoms up adoption is now only available to the end users who pay the most, an antithetical result, that will ultimately hurt the marketing funnel. These misaligned goals come about because the pricing plan is incorrectly targeted to the end user. Instead, the management functionality, not the end user’s experience, should change depending on a customer’s willingness to pay. Yammer’s user experience never changed when a customer converted from free to paid. The driving factor to conversion wasn’t the end user, but IT’s desire for control. For Expensify, the same is true. The paid product features satisfy the needs of accountants and company finance teams, not end users. To maximize growth, the end user should be using the same product, whether free or paid. Tiered pricing plans for freemium business work best when the feature differentiation targets managers, not end users. Which customer base does your pricing plan target?

It’s been a little while since I traded code with anyone. But a few weeks ago, one of our entrepreneurs-in-residence, Javier , who joined Redpoint from VMWare, told me about a Ruby gem called Mechanize that makes it really easy to crawl websites, particularly those with username/password logins. In about 30 minutes I had a working LinkedIn crawler built, pulling the names of new followers, new LinkedIn connections and LinkedIn status updates. All of that information is useful for me. But I just can’t seem to pull it from LinkedIn any other way. Crawling is the fastest, easiest and best solution. Over the years, I’ve used or built a number of crawlers: at Google to track competitive market share across ad networks, at Redpoint to build a BD pipleine and to mine social networks, and also mobile app store crawlers. Programmed well, crawlers are the quick and dirty solution to aggregating data from the web at scale. Crawlers are one of the most powerful tools at the disposal of startups and I think some of the most underrated. In the spirit of paying it forward, I’ve copied the beginning of my LinkedIn crawler below. The script pulls the first page people who have viewed your profile in the last day and extracts their names, locations, titles and industries.

For over two years, Larry and Sergey met CEO candidates before deciding to hire Eric Schmidt. Hiring a CEO was a condition investors imposed as part of the Series A terms. After the investment closed, the founders wanted to renege on that part of the agreement , but the board asked the duo to meet some of the valley’s top CEOs. At which point, Larry and Sergey only wanted to hire Steve Jobs. Eventually, they found and hired Eric. From Netflix to Facebook, Twitter to Google, successful startups build great management teams. But it isn’t easy to hire an executive of any sort (CEO, VP Marketing, VP of Sales, etc) because the executive hiring process is radically different from every previous hire in the startup’s life. It’s the first hire that requires trust. The Perfect Process During the early stages of a startup, founders perfect the art of hiring individual contributors, employees who are hired to accomplish particular tasks. Cofounders join forces often because of their complimentary tactical skills: product manager meets engineer. Then, the co-founders scale the engineering team to code faster. Next, the company hires a young salesperson or entry-level marketer. The hiring processes for each of these roles is similar: interviewers test core relevant skills during the interview with coding challenges, mock sales pitches, brainteasers, marketing funnel optimization, and so on. All of these tests are tactical tests for individual contributor roles. But what skills do you test in a CEO interview? Or a head of marketing search? And once hired, how is the candidate evaluated? By definition, these roles are management roles, not individual contributor roles so the tactical tests aren’t the right ones.  Which means the interview and evaluation process is different and new and scary. Time to Failure What’s more, the time to failure for a management hire is much longer than a new lackluster individual contributor whose subpar performance is noticed immediately. Unlike individual contributors, managers are hired to build teams. Your new head of sales will hire a team of 1 to 3 people in the next six months. And it will be hard to gauge the success of the four-person team in less than a year.  If the head of sales is the wrong fit, it’s likely the whole team has to be let go - an expensive mistake: 9 months of 3 people’s salaries, not including the opportunity cost of having found the right person. In other words, an individual contributor hire is a short-term leveraged experiment: only one hire, less capital at risk and immediate criteria for evaluation. The Grand Bargain Then, why take the risk of hiring an executive to build a team? Three reasons: (i) attract top talent, (ii) learn and iterate faster, and (iii) grow the business faster. The right high profile hire will be able to recruit top level talent to work for the team. Talent magnets like John Allspaw, Adam Nash, Kenny van Zant and others build great teams because of their gravity within their respective ecosystems. Like engineering design patterns or marketing best practices, management is a learned and perfected skill. Great managers bring with them expertise in team and culture building. Hiring that proficiency instead of re-inventing the wheel saves time. Hiring the right team and enabling that team to be more productive will grow the business faster. Startups are built person by person, team by team. Entrusting a worthy manager with that responsibility can drive tremendous leverage in the business. Setting Yourself Up for Success During the beginning of their lives, early stage startups develop processes to find the best individual contributors. As startups mature, their management teams need to add a new hiring process - one that finds the most capable and trustworthy managers to help grow the business. Every management hiring process is different. Larry and Sergey took Eric to Burning Man to develop their relationship and build trust. Whether action sports, alternative music festivals or brainstorming sessions late into the night, the most important part of this essential transition for startups is building trust - the basis of all great relationships. I’d love to hear what you think. What are the best ways to build trust with new key hires? Write me on Branch NB: h/t to Josh Reeves who each helped me articulate many of the ideas in this post.

Writing on the web is undergoing a renaissance. What started in the late 90s as mass-market adoption of blogging has given way to high production quality, curated magazines . Despite all the innovation in blogging, there’s one part of the magazine that hasn’t been reinvented: the Letter to the Editor. If you’ve ever read the Economist, you might have breezed past this section. Two pages long and full of small quips and challenges, the Letter to the Editor section has its own culture. Each letter starts with “SIR –”, a relic of the magazine’s roots that I adore. Every major publication has such a section. But the blogging magazines like Svbtle, Medium, LinkedIn and the Magazine lack it. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been asking successful bloggers like Chris Dixon and Andy Chen about the keys to their growth. Among other responses, both highlighted community. But not just any community - one that engages in thoughtful discourse. Just look to one of Dixon’s most successful posts, one on ecommerce in which many of the top ecommerce startup CEOs responded with their thoughts. The democratized blog platforms of the 90s solved the problem of communication between author and reader with comments. Today, commenting is out of vogue because it leads to two problems: spam and vitriolic anger. You might argue no one reads these comments and they have no impact, but a study published in Science proves the opinions carried in the comments meaningfully impact readers' perception of what they read . Kicking discussions to forums like HackerNews or Twitter is an interim hack, but it decreases the value of the magazine’s platform by sapping readership. Whether on-site or off-site, comments aren’t the right communication vector. Instead, a redesigned, curated section for Letters to the Editor or one step further, Letters to the Author might cultivate a reading community much more effectively than the commenting platforms in use today. It would be a place for discussions like the one between Dixon and Jason Goldberg to occur all of the time. As the writing renaissance blossoms, the key to its long term success is fostering the exchange between readers and authors. We don’t yet have the proper tools engender thoughtful, productive argument and exploration. But I’m hopeful that as part of the blog’s reinvention, the re-imagining of the letter to the editor will draw an audience’s deeper engagement with these new magazines.

Tracing the arc of Facebook’s user sharing model is to identify the biggest case of frog boiling in history. Contrast Facebook’s origins as a dating site limited to students attending a particular college to an exhibitionist’s dream syndicating every detail of a life across of 1000+ friend networks and potentially many more followers. The question for users is: what is the quid pro quo? What value am I gaining in exchange for my data. Is it a fair swap or a bait and switch? What do you think? Message me on twitter with your thoughts In my view, the data-by product created by users is enormously valuable and fuel for innovation. Facebook’s billions in revenue is the most direct proof and the ecosystems built around the data stream are at least as large. Max Levchin’s newest company Affirm , Kaggle, Lending Club, Lyft and others use social signals to build credit and trust signals for potentially billions of dollars worth of transactions. Pointing to the revenue of these companies as examples of corporate raiding of personal data is flawed. Consumers benefit from new forms of credit and lending, market places with less friction and increased trust on the web. All web services evolve, their value propositions will change and the use of user data will morph to rise to the demands of the users and customers. The challenges in privacy occur when a web service’s users and customers are different, eg the case of users and advertisers. We’re still figuring out to to properly handle those potential conflicts. It’s a work in progress. For a compelling counterpoint, read Juile Cohen’s paper in Harvard Law Review called “What Privacy Is For?” . Cohen argues privacy is a fundamental right of a functioning democratic society and today because of our love affair with Big Data and innovation, we have cast aside any regulation or oversight of privacy. Nor do we have the tools to properly understand the type and extent of data usage. This privacy/innovation debate is fascinating because it exists at the intersection politics, ethics, innovation and societal values. No one wants to be a frog, slowly boiled, who realizes one day all privacy is gone. But the value created by Big Data is unquestionable. There’s the rub.

Amazon operates its businesses at very close to break-even, zero net margin, to win the greatest share and prevent competition from undercutting them. This is as true for their books business as their infrastructure business, AWS. Bezos has explicitly stated this strategy and it’s the one that has led to Amazon’s massive success in many different lines of business. Over sushi, a friend explained to me that this strategy might also extend to the way the company views acquisitions. If Amazon’s strategy is to run most of their businesses at break-even including acquisitions, then the value of a profitable and fast-growing startup to Amazon is decidedly less than to a another acquirer who will run a business at greater margin if for no other reason than the startup will spin-off less cash under Amazon’s low-margin strategy. Many acquirers will pursue attractive larger, revenue generating startups with an aim to keep running the business as is (without changing the economics of the business). Ideally, acquisitions increase the revenue and profitability of the the parent company, increasing stock price and enabling the parent to raise capital more easily in the public markets. After that speculative conversation about Amazon’s M&A strategy, I’ve been wondering whether, all things being equal, the acquirer who pays the most for a startup is the one willing/capable to run the business at the highest margin. Of course, I’m setting aside all strategic considerations (technology ownership, brand, sales synergies, etc). What do you think? Message me on twitter with your thoughts

“Blades square,” the coach yelled from the Boston Whaler as he increased the speed on his outboard motor, pursuing the eight man boat as we gained speed. I sat in four-seat, right in the middle of the engine room, the place for the taller, heavier rowers. The eight man team reluctantly complied with the coach’s order and rowed across the Long Island Sound, NYAC jerseys on our backs and the muggy, humid early summer morning sun reflecting in the water, practicing for national championships. Most of the time, oarsmen feather their oars - rotating the blades to be parallel to the water as they move through the air, helping the boat run on an even keel. Holding the blades square decreases the margin for error from a few inches to a few quarters of an inch. If anyone in the boat splashes their oar in the water, the delicate balance of the boat is upset, teammates grumble and the boat slows dramatically. In college, we rowed blades square only infrequently. It was a difficult technique drill. At NYAC, blades square was the norm. The coach demanded blades square all the time. Before races, after races, at 5am when we pushed off the dock to start practice and and 8am when we returned, dog-tired. The blades square mentality pervaded the rest of our practices. Coach held us to standards higher than we expected to hold ourselves. Because he demanded blades square, we demanded it from ourselves. And it became a matter of pride. I’ll never forget those first days rowing blades square, my knuckles bloodied from hitting the gunwales each time an oar touched the water and the boat balance collapsed to one side. Nor will I forget the rest of the summer when blades square became routine and eventually second nature. Or the weight silver medal hanging around my neck as I stood on the podium. One of the entrepreneurs I’m lucky enough to work with has an expression for this idea that I love: “every damn day.” It’s the battle cry for 2013 for his company. It’s a refrain for excellence day in day out, through the dark cold winter and the lazy dog days of summer. Whatever you call it, rowing blades square or every damn day, the idea is the same. Leaders have to demand excellence from their teams and drive teams to expect excellence from themselves. Every damn day.

Marketing is one of those words without meaning. Or at least a consistent meaning for most people. Recently, I met a very bright marketer who broke down a few of the different marketing disciplines and matched them to a freemium sales funnel. His framework is a stroke of genius. I’ve drawn it below. The Four Disciplines of Funnel Marketing The triangle on the left is a standard freemium customer conversion process. First customers become aware of the product, then they use the free version of the product, then they convert to paid either by themselves or with the aid of an inside sales team, and finally they are retained as customers. The rectangle on the right contains the marketing disciplines used to grow and optimize customer acquisition metrics on the right. The list isn’t meant to be comprehensive but does get the gist across. At the top of the funnel PR, word of mouth and reach marketing are the tools to drive more awareness. Examples include press mentions, viral product features, app store promotion and features, web page optimization, and so on. Second, engagement marketing draws freemium users into the products. Engagement marketing includes product tutorials and videos, welcome emails and support. Third, content marketing closes accounts. Content marketing includes blogging to targeted segments within the user base about useful product tips and social interest posts like customer testimonials. Additionally, content marketing inside sales collateral, like the scripts used over the phone by the sales and support reps. Data science also fits in this stage when customer segmentation, remarketing, direct marketing and online acquisition can be most effective. Last, lifecycle marketing retains customers by reinforcing the value proposition of the product customers pay for.  Customer success teams may call customers with low usage to educate them about the product. Managed support communities build trust into the customer base. And of course email drip campaigns can be quite effective. Mix and Match You’ll notice that the tools used in each of the stages isn’t unique. Email, blogging, customer interaction might be used in all or just one of the steps. It depends on the product and sales cycle. But the goals of the customer interaction change during each step. It’s the responsibility of the marketing team to first understand the objective at each stage in the sales process and best equip their teams with the tools in product, eng, and sales with the various marketing disciplines to maximize success. Marketing Clarity This framework really helped me understand the many different disciplines of marketing and when to apply them. I hope it’s helpful for you and your business.

Last night I spoke at the Enterprise Tech VC Panel . We discussed five trends in the seed market and the outlook for 2013. These are the five most important trends for 2013, in my view. MicroVC Funds Have Doubled Their Assets Call it micro-VC or mega-seed fund, there’s a new investor class which raises funds between $50 and $100M to invest in seed-stage companies. Felicis manages a $70M fund, Jeff Clavier at Softech invests from a $55M fund and Steve Anderson of Baseline has raised at two funds totaling $100M. These seed investors invest larger amounts than before (both initially and during follow-on rounds) and invest in more startups. Seed Round Sizes Have Ballooned In 2008, when I first started in venture, a$500k seed was sizable. A $1M seed turned heads. Today, those amounts are routine, if small. In the past year, micro-VCs have doubled the capital they invest each year to $1.6B. In addition, traditional VCs also have continued to  participate actively in the seed market. As a result of these two pools of capital entering the market, seed rounds are approaching Series A sizes. Lacking accurate census data to illustrate the trend, I’ll use an extreme case to prove the point: Virool raised $6.6M last week in a “party” seed round. CrowdFunding and MarketPlaces Bring New Viable Forms Of Seed Capital No one can argue with the success of fund raising campaigns on KickStarter and Indiegogo. Ouya effectively raised a $8.6M Series A in the form of early orders on Kickstarter . In addition to crowdsourcing sites, Angelist (in partnership with SecondMarket) and FundersClub attract $1k+ investment sizes from non-traditional angels looking for exposure to startups. As a friend pointed out to me, it all feels a bit like the 1999 bubble, when everyone can and wants to invest in a dot-com. Instead of using the public markets to buy shares, private markets have blossomed to meet this demand. Mezzanine Seed Funds Have Entered The Market You don’t often hear the word mezzanine in the valley. It’s much more common in private equity conversations. But with the boom in seed investments, driven by the capital flooding the asset class, mezzanine seed funds have taken root. Mezz seed funds target startups who have raised a seed round, but haven’t been able to achieve the milestones to attract a Series A investment. So they seek a second seed round, a mezzanine seed round, for a bit more runway and a second chance to raise an A. Rising Labor Costs Increase Burn But Fuel The Acquihire Trend As infrastructure costs plummet, labor costs are soaring because of a talent supply/demand imbalance. These labor costs require larger seed rounds to achieve the same runway. In fact, for most of Redpoint’s portfolio companies, labor is the single biggest line item on the P&L. On the other side of the coin, the overwhelming demand for top talent drives  the acquihire market. Every major technology company has a talent acquisition strategy based on M&A. Acquisitions by FB, GOOG, YHOO, EBAY and others provide a landing place for struggling seed companies looking for strategic options and a non-zero return for investors. The New Bull Market The seed market feels like a bull market: lots of capital rushing in, new asset classes being created, and a ton of opportunity for entrepreneurs looking for some early capital to change the world. NB: Thanks to Sundeep Peechu and Chris Gottschalk who inspired this post. And thanks to Mike and Victor for inviting me to the panel discussion.

If asked to describe the characteristics of a successful freemium business, I might highlight three things: effective community marketing, command of new distribution platforms, and a paid product users love that is priced by usage. Look no further than ZenDesk, Evernote, Expensify, Dropbox. Each of them has built a vibrant user base using freemium products. But what if instead of pointing to SaaS companies as the vanguards of this movement, I lauded The Atlantic, The New York Times and the Financial Times? In fact, SaaS companies can learn quite a lot from the marketing efforts of content companies. In both cases, a great product alone is not sufficient to maximize growth. Marketing plays an essential role. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_145_770022089"> Publishing houses invented the subscription model and have honed the marketing tactics to support it. The first subscription business developed in the 1700s as a way to hedge the risks of a single, fickle patron underwriting book publishing costs. The most important works of the era including the first illustrated edition of Milton’s Paradise Lost were financed this way. In the 300 years since its invention, the content subscription model hasn’t changed, but the marketing tactics have been refined. The three major marketing tactics employed by these companies are: Daily community marketing : The Atlantic’s blogs provide daily high quality content for consistent engagement between published issues . These blogs cement the brand and voice in users' daily lives while reinforcing the value of the journalism in the magazine. In addition to staff blogs, several publications have adopted the contributor model, the newest wave of community marketing. The WSJ Accelerators Program co-opts key members of a community who write on particular topics and bring their own audiences to the WSJ. Similarly, the effectiveness of Mint or OKCupid or GitHub’s blog can’t be overstated as a method for engaging the community every day. ZenDesk’s blog highlights challenges their customers face and suggests solutions allying the company with their user base. Leveraging new distribution channels: Publishing great daily content isn’t enough. Customers and potential customers need to read it. BuzzFeed is the canonical example of content reverse-engineered to succeed on social networks. The power of social networks for content syndication is enormous. Ride the wave. Freemium business rely on large, vocal, passionate user bases . Catalyzing these groups to get together (whether online or offline), discuss key issues, problems and solutions as a community is essential for growth. Mobile is an equally important channel. For the Financial Times more than half of revenue is digital thanks to mobile app store distribution. Marco Arment’s the Magazine is the second highest grossing iPhone news app - generating more revenue than the WSJ, the Economist and the New Yorker . That’s the power of new distribution channels. Similarly, the lion’s share of Expensify’s users come across the application through mobile app stores. Because these users are free, no one can compete with Expensify’s cost of customer acquisition, creating a big moat for competitors. Free content creates a marketing base: All that great content published by news organizations invites users to learn more about the publication, participate in conversations, download mobile apps, share content and so on, generating data. This data is fuel for marketing to build customer sales campaigns to drive content subscriptions, eg the FT’s dynamic paywall which decides how many free articles to permit a user based on that user’s propensity to pay. Freemium SaaS companies are no different. The goals of the freemium product are to create prioritized leads for a marketing or sales team to close with much greater efficiency than an uninformed outbound calling campaign. The tactics of content marketing companies apply equally well to freemium SaaS businesses who can leverage content, community and data to great success.

In HBR this month, two British researchers reported on their study of the impact of competition on startups. In a study of over 2M companies spanning 10 years, the researchers determined that if a startup faced competition in its first year, it was more likely to fail. But if the startup survived its first year, it’s survival rate jumped nearly 30%. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_146_735522163"> This data screams survivorship bias . Of course the startups who navigate hostile waters deftly in their first year will have a higher likelihood of success. These startups' management teams have already proven they can develop marketing and sales competencies while bringing a product to market. The takeaway from this study shouldn’t be any new insight about whether a startups should enter markets with our without competitors. There is no question startups should choose markets or market segments without competitors. Less competition implies more time to figure things out and ultimately better margins. Instead, the data shows the importance of focus on a differentiated and defensible value proposition in the face of competition and the importance of building a team who can manage a company in the face of great odds. Without either, startups fail faster. Whether tested early in their development or much later, great teams building differentiated products win.

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_147_724326134" width="500px"> Successful startups are money machines: they ingest a dollar of investment and produce more than a dollar in revenue. There are three steps to build a money machine: Find or create a product many people will use. Convince customers to buy the product. Mechanize the two processes above, reducing costs and increasing profitability to finance growth. Startups repeat these three steps many times during their lifespans. In a team of seven people, there may be five engineers building the product, one product manager marketing the product and one salesperson. But to grow to be a big company, all those teams and functions must be continuously reinvented, tuned and refined. Whether working with ThredUp, an online consignment store, or AxialMarket, a market place for private capital, or Electric Imp, the infrastructure that powers the internet of things, the progression through these steps is similar. And one of these disciplines is always the limiting factor. When evaluating the priorities for your business, frame your startup’s progression using this framework. Your goal is to identify which of the three steps currently limits the growth of the business so that you can systematically eliminate the current bottleneck, the friction to limiting greater output from your money-machine.

For sales people, social proof is one of the most powerful forms of influence, as Robert Ciadini proved in his seminal book on the topic . It’s no secret that the best leads are referrals. Second best is the friend who is a customer in common: “Oh, Peter chose Salesforce for his CRM. Maybe I should consider them too.” Social proof confers the trust of a relationship to the salesperson improving close rates. But social proof is entirely absent from sales software. Salesforce which generates $3B in revenue and has amassed a market cap of $25B is the most successful CRM software of our era. But neither of the two innovations Salesforce brought to market, CRM delivered over the web and a bottoms-up sales process, help salespeople close more business. In fact, if you speak to Salesforce users, many will complain the data entry slows them down. The startup that disrupts Salesforce will be worth much much more because instead of simply recording leads and sales, the next CRM will create business for its customers leveraging social proof. It won’t be enough for a CRM to inform a salesperson which potential customer to call the way Salesforce’s task list operates today. This new CRM will scour the web to find potential customers, discover points of social proof   with potential customers increasing close rates and finally record the transactions in the system. Today, Salesforce only solves the last problem, which is by far the least valuable of the three. Imagine if you could log into a system each morning, see a list of potential customers, understand how you are connected to those people through friends of friends, work colleagues, college affiliations, common interests. Once on the phone with a prospect, you might inform them of friends who use your product or even competitors. Your close rates would skyrocket because of the social proof at your disposal. To call this software customer-relationship management would be describing only a fraction of the value such a product would create. Salesforce’s disruptor won’t be a CRM company. It will be something much, much bigger.

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_149_519798243" width="500px"> Peter Thiel and Gary Kasparov wrote in the Financial Times about “Our dangerous illusion of tech progress” . The main point of the article is quoted below: [We are living in an era of] cautiousness far too satisfied with incremental improvements. Our ability to do basic things such as protect ourselves from earthquakes and hurricanes, to travel and to extend our lifespans is barely increasing [since the 1960s]. The genuine progress in IT from the 1970s up to the 2000s masked the relative stagnation of energy, transportation, space, materials, agriculture and medicine. When Plodders Change the World Thiel/Kasparov argue that we are collectively focused on incremental rather than transformative change.  Coincidentally the following week week, Clay Christensen made a similar argument in the NYTimes These arguments presume that efficiency gains never lead to transformative change. Like Thiel, I think Christensen undervalues efficiency innovations. Combining efficiency innovations can lead to enabling innovations that create new industries. For example, coupling cheap computing with virtualization enabled cloud computing - a potentially $100B industry .  Shannon, a research at Bell Labs, invented digital telephony, an incremental bandwidth usage improvement over analog transmission which ultimately enabled the Internet. The text message (SMS), a trivial innovation, is the banking mechanism over which 33% of Kenyan GDP flows. Blue ocean opportunities like asteroid mining and commercial space travel will attract a certain type of personality. And efficiency innovations will attract another. There is room and a need for both. Though they pursue innovation in different ways, directly and indirectly, these entrepreneurs do change the world similarly. Banging on the wrong pots and pans While it may be true that an increasing number of people are focused on efficiency innovation as the field of entrepreneurship grows, the claim that we’re not pursuing significant problems is inaccurate. Below is a list of advances made in various fields from a few Google queries. Significant innovation is occurring in fields like healthcare, transportation and agriculture. Health 1. The average US lifespan has increased by 9 years (13%) since 1960 . 2. The FDA just approved the first digital pill that monitors patients response treatments . 3. The cost of sequencing a genome has fallen by more than 4 orders of magnitude - much, much faster than Moore’s law. Transportation 1. Google thinks it is five years away from productionizing self-driving cars . 2. The number of passenger miles flown in the US has increased by 18x since 1960 and jets have never been safer to fly. 3. Fatalities on US roads per capita has fallen by 80% since 1960 . Agriculture 1. Agricultural yields in the US have increased 250% for corn, 200% for wheat and soybeans, and 75%+ for barley and oats. Right cause, questionable war-cry There’s no doubt, we could always be aiming higher, funding research and new ideas to a greater extent, relaxing H1B visa restrictions or reducing barriers to entry for new companies. To his great credit, Thiel is a contributor to this effort. He has many initiatives to finance progress: the Thiel fellows programs, his numerous investment vehicles and working with his colleagues from PayPal who have built SpaceX, Telsa, Yammer, LinkedIn and other disruptive companies. But to question the progress and changes we’ve seen in the past 50 years and the innovations that we’re on the cusp of commercializing is a misleading way to build a groundswell. Even if the cause is laudable.

On a Saturday morning in August of 2006, Sergey Brin and a team of Googlers flew to Los Angeles to meet Tom Anderson and his MySpace team. By the next afternoon, the two founders shook hands on a three year $900M contract. About twelve months later, I found myself as the product manager for the team in Marrakesh, Google’s executive board room, reporting the state of affairs to Eric, Larry and Sergey. After signing the letter of intent, Google assembled a superb five-person team of machine learning experts and tasked them with improving ad targeting on MySpace and other social networks. At the time social networks like LinkedIn, Bebo, MySpace, Hi5, BlackPlanet and others generated about 40% of ad impressions for AdSense, but only 2 to 3% of revenue. The disparity was extreme. When Sergey signed the contract with MySpace, Google hadn’t built the technology to properly target ads on social networks. But he believed it could be developed. And he was right. Over the course of the next 18 months, the engineering team experimented and tinkered. They discovered that the language on social networks varies greatly from the language on the rest of the web. We threw away the dictionaries used for AdSense targeting and built new dictionaries using social-native dialects. The team modeled the dispersion of conversations through out the network in different ways - testing, testing, testing. Every week, we reviewed the experimental results. Marrakesh is a long, thin room with grey walls, red couches. Two monitors hung on the wall at one end and Eric sat at the head of the table on the other side. When we stood up to present, we reported that in just a few quarters, the engineering team had increased revenue by greater than 10x. More importantly, they proved intent could be extracted from social media conversations at scale. As social media usage continues to grow exponentially, users will pour out their opinions into conversations across the web in ever greater numbers. Within the morass of LOLs and emoticons, there is real value to be found. Redpoint has invested in two companies which also pursue this idea: BlueFin , which Twitter just acquired , and Quantifind . Both BlueFin and Quantifind harvest data from the social web to glean meaningful insights and grow revenue for their customers. We are only at the beginning of understanding the value of data contained within social media. I believe there is another 10x hidden in that tweet.

If you’re a Netflix subscriber, in all likelihood you’re a big fan of “House of Cards.” Netflix designed it that way. With the release of “House of Cards” Netflix began the Moneyball-era of content production. The majority of Netflix subscribers watch Kevin Spacey, political thrillers and David Fincher’s movies . Guess what? “House of Cards” has all three. In baseball, on-base percentage is the best predictive metric for team success. In content production, the best predictor is user viewership behavior. Because of Netflix’s scale, 25M+ subscribers, and because of its highly granular recommendation technology which measures viewership on a per household basis and includes all the metadata (actors, directors, plot) about each movie and TV show, Netflix has arguably the best return-on-investment calculator for content on the planet. This content evaluation machine drove the decision to resurrect the cancelled “Arrested Development” series. Now a terrifically successful show, “Family Guy” was also cancelled. But it wasn’t the studio chiefs who decided to return the show to prime time. By the thousands, fans complained loudly enough to convince FOX of the inaccuracies of their data, rescuing the show and driving billions of revenue to FOX. How many of these kinds of mistakes have been made? It’s impossible to say. Data-driven content production will come to dominate TVs and movies. We know the models work - we have seen it first hand on the web - and in order to survive, access to such data will be table stakes in the entertainment industry. Like Netflix, the raft of startups is building channels on YouTube including Machinima, Maker Studios and many others leverage viewership data to tune  and match their content to their viewers' desires. These channels represent the future of television - a future in which the demands of viewers are satisfied because the shows are tailored to them.

When interviewing product managers at Google, we ranked candidates on four metrics: technical ability, communication skills, intellect and Googliness. A Googley person embodies the values of the company - a willingness to help others, an upbeat attitude, a passion for the company, and the most important, humility. In the past week, I asked two heads of engineering to identify the most important characteristic in new hires. Both responded, “humility”. For one startup ascertaining humility is so important, it is the first filter in the interview process. Disruptive companies reinvent. They don’t copy and execute someone else’s playbook. To be disruptive, a startup’s team must cast aside preconceived notions and assumptions about doing things the “right way” and start inventing new ways. The more time I spend in venture capital working with startups, the better I understand that there are no templates or stencils or best practices. Each startup team faces a unique market opportunity with distinct market dynamics, sales processes, competitive forces, assets and challenges. In such circumstances, the best expeditionary force keeps open minds about the way forward. They learn from each other and the market. The first step to learning is accepting we don’t know everything.

Kenny Van Zant is a marketing wizard. Before his current role at Asana, Kenny managed products and marketing for Solarwinds , a publicly traded company that sells networking equipment to the mid-market. Solarwinds pioneered the low-friction, high-velocity sales model in their segment to great success. SolarWinds offered free products to their customers to gain usage data that informs their sales and marketing efforts. As one might expect, inside sales reps would call upon the most likely customers to up-sell them to paid. And of course, SolarWinds employed the enterprise sales team to win the business of the largest customers.  Plain vanilla freemium, right? But over a conversation earlier this week, Kenny pointed out that freemium businesses switch the hunter and farmer sales team roles, an important twist that had escaped me. In traditional businesses, the enterprise team hunts. They acquire leads, cold call, and try to push the customers to close. Their counterparts, the inside sales team, nurture and cultivate these relationships to prevent churn and grow revenue through up-sell and by growing with their customers. Freemium businesses reverse the roles. The inside sales team fields the freemium leads, make the cold calls and push the customers to close. The enterprise sales team looks for multiple teams paying separately within one customer, build a relationship, and grow revenue through up-sell, helping their customers grow. It’s plain to see the marketing departments of freemium companies must be constructed differently, with a strong quantitative bent. But freemium businesses also require a fundamentally different sales team structure. In one hour, Kenny completely transformed my understanding of freemium software companies.  I hope he decides to teach a course at Stanford one day his framework for success. It would be a huge a success and might very well change the trajectory of many SaaS companies.

David Brooks has a great op-ed this morning on the Philosophy of Data . He argues that data offers one major advantage and one major drawback. Data enables humans to discover patterns otherwise unobservable by our senses/intuition or patterns that violate human intuition. But the religion of data engenders a fallacy: that everything can and should be measured; and with this data, the best answer will emerge. Belief in the power of data has become a sort of religious debate which has manifested itself in product design (data driven vs intuitive design), in politics, in baseball , in climate change debates and many others. At some level, it’s an extension of the religion/ science debate: what I feel/believe vs what my instruments indicate. Which is better? Great innovations can come from both disciplines. Apple’s product design is built from intuition and belief - not from programmatic user testing. On the other hand, Google innovation in search focused exclusively using large scale multivariate testing and metrics optimization. I believe the best innovations blend the two, mixing art and science. Great product ideas are borne of intuition but honed and fine tuned using data. In fact, when a company or product has reached has plateaued, when innovation has reached a local maximum, it’s often because one of these two disciplines has dominated thought. And it’s time to swing the pendulum back the other way. Google’s recent focus on design and the reinvention of search’s user interface in Google Now exemplifies such a transition. A traditionally data driven company, Google has reinvented the feel of their brand and products using intuition. In this debate as with most, zealotry will often command attention, but compromise will drive success. Both ways of thinking promise breakthroughs and innovation. Mastering both means balancing the two.

With a litany of articles in recent months highlighting the number of companies with valuations greater than $1B , I’ve started to wonder about the valuation trends for the highest profile venture backed companies. Venture capitalists are increasing market prices in Series A and Series B rounds aggressively in effort to reap disproportionate returns. And the variances in the prices of different startups in these early rounds is enormous, indicating a relatively inelastic market. Investors are chasing fast-growth startups irrespective of the price. I gathered data on 77 rounds in the last 18 months by “high flying” companies using my own admittedly biased definition. Below is a table of the median, average and standard deviation of those Series A, B and C rounds. Round Median Average Std Dev Count Series A 31 65 135 46 Series B 120 289 638 21 Series C 212 318 333 10 I’ve also plotted the distributions below. Click to see a bigger image: The Factors Behind the Trends Returns in venture capital follow a power law - the top 1% of companies return the lion’s share of capital. As a result, venture capital demand to invest in high fliers is inelastic. Look at those standard deviations. They are massive! Venture capitalists have raised growth funds to pursue companies generating $10M or more in revenue - Redpoint and many other firms have sought to invest in startups 24 months or so before an IPO, providing growth capital as startups remain private longer. The return characteristics on these funds enable them to pay higher valuations than traditional funds. These growth funds are playing in all parts of the market including the Series A and Series B. GitHub, Lynda, and many other startups are bootstrapped and their Series A is a $35M+ round at a multi-hundred million dollar valuation, skewing the results. Caveats With a data set so small and subjectively gathered, there is bound to be bias and error. But I think the flawed data does support the anecdotal trend of rising valuations and enormous variances among top startups at all stages. For these startups, it’s a seller’s market.

Even the greatest minds fear missing out. Nobel laureate Richard Feynman who assisted in the development of the atomic bomb, contributed substantial advances to quantum mechanics and particle physics, discovered the cause of the Challenger Shuttle disaster and popularized science as a witty and successful author, faced this fear when confronted with a menu. How many different dishes should he order from a menu before settling upon a favorite? Feynman used probability theory to solve the problem. Below is the formula he developed with Ralph Leighton The number of dishes to try = √2(Meals remaining at restaurant+1) - 1 Fear of missing out is a paralyzing force. It even drives geniuses to mathematics for consolation. Having calculated the number of dishes to try, Feynman could rest, his mind at ease knowing that in all likelihood, he was eating the best plate on the menu. With the panoply of options before us as founders, investors, managers and employees, the fear of missing out on key meetings, conferences, marketing initiatives, employment candidates, investment opportunities is rampant. There is always one more meeting to attend, one more person to meet, one more option to consider. Within that last meeting, we seek assurance and validation that the choice we have made is the right one. But the byproduct of the relentless pursuit of the “best” can be debilitation. FOMO diffuses attention, sapping the focus which is often so necessary to success. Feynman quelled his fears with probability. Most of us won’t approach problems with the same rigor. But all of us are seeking the same peace of mind. I think it comes down to accepting that, as is written on Facebook’s walls, done is better than perfect. It’s more important to keep moving forward with a good decision than to slowly optimize for the best decision every time. I don’t need a menu, thanks. I’ll have the spaghetti and meatballs.

The most important principle of start up fund raising is: Raise enough money to achieve a set of milestones that will attract a subsequent round of investment from new investors. Last week, a founder of a seed stage company came to pitch. When I told him the opportunity wasn’t a fit for us, he asked me what milestones he would need to achieve to raise a Series A - as he was raising a seed round! He was calibrating how much he needed to raise for in his seed to make sure he could raise a Series A. After we spoke, he drafted a financial plan to calculate the size of the seed investment he would need to achieve those milestones and added a reasonable cash buffer. In effect, he reverse-engineered his Series A. This is the same process investors follow when investing in a company. During the term sheet negotiations, VCs and founders discuss the size of the investment and the corresponding milestones the company will be able to accomplish with more or less cash. Like founders, investors are concerned about follow-on fund raising risk and reverse-engineer the next round to mitigate that risk. The long term success of a venture-backed startup hinges on the ability of the founding team to raise follow on capital to finance research, fuel product development, discover product market fit and ultimately scale sales and marketing. To minimize financing risk, raise a seed that will enable you to raise an A. Raise an A to raise a Series B and so on.

Brokers serve two key roles within ecosystems. First, they introduce buyers and sellers. Second, they lend their expertise to help buyers and sellers make the right decisions in the market. The internet neutralizes the first value proposition of brokers by leveling the information asymmetry between buyers and sellers at a far greater scale with much better data than any broker ever could. And for products and services with relatively small price points, commodity goods or where the cost of failure is low, market places often nullify the value (and cost) of an advisor. Market places are arguably the best examples of this kind of disruption. Whether in ad tech (Google AdX), real estate (LoopNet, RedFin), accommodation (HomeAway, AirBnB), goods (eBay, etsy), classifieds (Craigslist), taxis (Uber, Hailo), travel ( the GDS systems ), financial services (AxialMarket, Angelist) market places are black holes within ecosystems. Market places exert such gravity that once at scale, they are almost impossible to disrupt. Craigslist is the canonical example but all of the companies listed have constructed almost unassailable moats. In real estate and financial services, where the value of the assets is measured in the millions or more and each asset is relatively unique, advice is valuable and customers will pay for it. So market places serving such verticals provide tools for brokers to succeed. Often, these tools provide both lead generation (customers) and management systems (CRM or deal tracking). But as data volumes continue to grow exponentially, I believe that the business of brokers of almost every kind will be disrupted. And technology will become the ultimate market maker.

Once each month I met Peter at Café Habana in Nolita for huevos rancheros drenched in tomato sauce and a glass of fresh orange juice. Mopping up yolks with tortillas, Peter and I chatted about his business: the techniques of scalable customer acquisition, the priorities of the product and engineering team, the structure of sales quotas and the ebbing and flowing dynamics of the market place he and his team were building. After two years, Peter called to say he was raising capital for his company; he invited us to take part in the process. I lept at the opportunity to work with Peter. I had witnessed how Peter managed adversity and uncertainty in his business and trusted his instincts and intuition. We had forged a working relationship over those breakfasts. During the fund raising process, Peter encouraged me to spend time with his team. In parallel, the Redpoint deal team researched the market opportunity heavily. Ultimately, our investment memo totaled 40 pages, laden with interviews of market place participants and industry experts. Then we began discussing terms. Peter negotiated terms aggressively and we shook hands on a partnership between AxialMarket and Redpoint in April 2012. In addition to having a special significance because of our friendship, AxialMarket was my first investment at Redpoint where I would be point and a member of the board. A year into our partnership, Peter and I still see each other at least once each month and have the same kinds of conversations we always shared. Sometimes those conversations occur in the board room instead of Cafe Habana. Reflecting on those two years, I admire the way Peter managed his fundraising process: building a relationship, evaluating our working styles and negotiating a fair set of terms. To be plain, those twenty-four breakfasts were quite possibly the longest investor interview process in history. Peter understood from the very beginning that founders and investors work together for quite a while. The data confirms it: the median venture-backed company requires seven to ten years to reach an acquisition or IPO. Most importantly, Peter showed me the value of building a long term relationship before seeking investment, the importance of a shared passion for the business, and the power of an alliance built on healthy, strong and honest relationships between investors and founders. And to think, it all started at a little Cuban place in Nolita over some rancheros…

Each time I open Salesforce in my browser, I think of Stephen Hawking. It’s because of an aphorism an entrepreneur shared with me a few weeks ago. He said: The cost to fix a data error at the time of entry is $1. The cost to fix it an hour after it’s been entered is $10. And the cost to fix it several months later is $100+. Take for example a venture capitalist’s CRM tool. If I mistype an email address or the details of the last fund raise, it might cost me a minute or two to fix it at that very moment. A minute of time is worth about $1. If I’m lazy and don’t correct the error, later on that day one of my colleagues might search our CRM for the company and comes across the erroneous record which he suspects is inaccurate. First, he will check his notes, then he will call me to verify and then he will change the record. The rigamarole has undermined his trust of my data and the ten minutes he spent correcting my data entry are wasted. Worst of all is if I contact a startup to inquire about an upcoming fund raise with incorrect data. As a result, I could miss an opportunity to partner with a great company because of incorrect timing or lose credibility with the startup’s executive team. The cost to the firm could be in the tens of millions of dollars. All because I was lazy updating the CRM record. Data promises compounding returns. The more data you have on a customer or prospect or your own business, the better the insights you can draw and the better decisions you can make. But these returns are blind to the quality of data. Bad data has equally great compounding effects. And as Hawking so succinctly put it: “The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.” – Stephen Hawking

The valley and startup-land does not fetishize failure despite the increasing reports to the contrary . FailCon is not the Darwin Awards for startups. Founders do not start businesses with the express interest to fail. Instead, the valley is infatuated with the post-mortem of failures and successes alike because within every venture are pearls of wisdom - a subtle but important difference. Extracting and applying these insights can be the difference between success and failure. This is why founders pursue knowledge relentlessly. Ultimately, iteration and learning speed is the hallmark of great startup teams Startups are vehicles designed to test hypotheses: Will millions of users participate in a photo sharing network? Will tens of thousands of businesses pay $10 per month for easy to use expense reports.  Understanding what worked and what didn’t is essential to maximizing the odds of success for new ventures. The valley in its entirety is structured to share learnings. Founders create huge information dissemination groups in person and through blogs. Incubators, accelerators and others have become de facto vocational training institutes. Advisors and VCs join boards to share experiences. And successful entrepreneurs return to their stomping grounds to regale newer founders with stories of their trials, tribulations and ultimate successes. The ambit of every one of these is success - not failure. The confusion is caused because we are overloading the term: fail fast, fail forward, etc and we may be doing ourselves a mild-disservice using these terms. But all of these concepts focus on learning quickly. This dogged pursuit of insight, knowledge and truth is at the core of the valley - not failure.

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_162_552429380" width="500px"> “It’s something I thought I’d never do,” one founder told me yesterday. He had hired a recruiter to help him grow his team. But at some point in time, most quickly growing startups will need help forming their teams. We kicked off searches at two Redpoint companies in earlier this year in addition to several last year and I’ve been taking notes on each of the processes. One of my partners, Tim Haley, was a top recruiter in the valley for many years and having his experience and expertise has been invaluable. These are my notes: When to Hire a Search Firm When the time vs money calculus changes. Recruiting is expensive and fees can range from $10k to $100k+ depending on the role and the firm. Firms either charge on a contingency basis (success fee) or on a retainer (fixed fee per month).  Seed stage companies typically can’t afford these services and so they allocate their time (instead of their dollars) to build pipelines. Having grown their balance sheets, Series A companies often employ retained recruiters for key positions (VPE, VPM, VPS) and then hire contingency recruiters for building the eng team. In all cases, it’s important to keep an eye on the costs. When the networks of the team and board cannot produce the right candidate pipeline. Most high level hiring processes begin with the CEO and the board rifling through LinkedIn or their CRMs to find relevant candidates. When that pipeline dries up, a recruiter can be an effective solution. How to Pick a Search Firm Choose a firm like you hire an employee. The recruiter is a paid representative of your company. They should be excited about the opportunity for the business, capable of selling the vision of the business and most importantly exude a personality that is culturally consistent with your startup. Reference the firm. Recruiters should be diligent about building a pipeline, communicating the state of that pipeline and working seamlessly with the CEO/founder to advance candidates through the pipeline efficiently. The only way to verify their working style is by calling previous clients. Screen for ethics. Ethics is the sine qua non of the recruiting world. Poaching employees from previous clients is verboten. Match the role and the expertise of the firm. Every firm and each person within that firm will have an expertise. Ask about the expertise, request sample candidate resumes and compare across firms to ensure the best fit. In-house or out-of-house Typically, more junior searches are completed in-house with some firms deploying a recruiter to work within the startup to understand the company better, reduce communication latency, and also present a unified experience to candidates. This is common for engineering recruiting. For more senior searches, out-of-house recruiters are the norm. Even publicly traded companies do this. How to Set Up the Process for Success Commitment to hiring. First, all the key stakeholders must be in agreement to that the company needs to fill a role. This includes the founders, the management team and the board. The person managing the process must also commit to prioritizing the search. Using recruiter as leverage to convince a team to hire results in a high failure rate and frustration all around. Establish consensus on the candidate profile. Before hiring a search firm, the startup should have a reasonably good idea of the responsibilities, background and role of the new hire(s). It’s critical that all the stakeholders reach consensus on this before the search. Don’t assume that everyone is in agreement, but write down the requisition and solicit comments to be certain. Share and discuss this requisition with the recruiter. Of course, this job requisition may evolve over time as the team learns through interviewing but most of the key requirements will remain. Write down and share the process. Every candidate should go through the same or very similar interview processes to establish a calibration among the hiring team. The key attributes of the role should be tested in interviews and verified with references. Use the start of the recruiting process to train the hiring team’s filter. Having the recruiter and most of the hiring team meet the first few candidates will ground conversations. Instead of speaking in hypotheticals about certain characteristics, the hiring team can point to strengths and weaknesses in individuals and calibrate the trade-offs. Hurry slowly. There’s a Latin expression, festina lente, meaning hurry slowly that describes succinctly the pace of these search processes. The Bay Area job market is a bustling. To win candidates, the hiring team must be responsive to candidates and aggressive with great prospects. But not rush! Leverage your assets. Ask the board of directors or advisors to help close candidates. Setting Up the Process for Success Like any team, a hiring team needs to communicate well, trust each other and agree to pursue the same goals. Hiring an external recruiter can accelerate the time to hiring a candidate dramatically. But it’s important to ensure that the search process is set up for success. I hope these notes will be helpful for you. Related: How to Build a Hiring Pipeline

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_163_528992076" width="500px"> I see a recurring three step pattern with data waves: First data collected. Then it’s presented. Last it is made actionable. In every data wave, the companies that transform data into actionable insights are the most valuable because their products not only identify but solve problems. Knowing about an issue without understanding the mechanics required to fix it causes paralysis. Quantified self tools like FitBit and JawboneUp and Nike Fuel capture and display sleep data and while these devices confirm that I wake at 130am every night, they can’t help me sleep through the night. This user experience induces neurosis. The same is true for the pedometer function - I can measure the steps I walk but not how much healthier I become (how much longer I’ll live). Similarly, social media monitoring tools apprise marketers of the thousands of conversations across the web that are relevant to their brands, but do little to recommend who to engage with, what to write about and how to prevent large scale negative viral loops from spiraling out of hand . On the other hand, true data based intelligence provides huge value to customers. For decades, software logging faced a similar challenge. Engineers would log data into increasingly larger databases which rapidly became a cost-prohibitive practice. When Splunk developed tools to mine this data, they unlocked the insights within the data which enabled engineers to act,  improving product performance. The measure of data is how much intelligence a user can derive from it and how quickly the user can respond to reinforce or counteract a new trend.

To be truly successful, I believe startups should determine which of the four core disciplines is their strength: product, engineering, marketing and sales  - and focus, focus, focus on leveraging that advantage in the market. Product driven startups -  At their outset Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram were exploratory products driven by their respective creators, Jack Dorsey Ben Silbermann, and Kevin Systrom, who were each product managers building a product of their own vision. The key innovations were the creation of new social environments. Engineering driven startups - Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed a new search algorithm at Google. The key innovations were engineering driven: relevancy, precision vs recall, response time. Marketing/customer acquisition driven startups - Mark Pincus, founder of Zynga, reconstructed well known games of chance and developed sophisticated marketing techniques to win market share in a commodity market. The key innovations were customer acquisition, retention and revenue maximization through social engineering. Sales driven startups - SolarWinds, an Austin based company selling network management software, created a new, incredibly profitable sales model to the segment. Even today they have 50% EBITDA margins. The key innovations were inside sales productivity and efficiency innovations. In the case of each of the companies above, the focus of the company was on crafting, honing and exploiting one particular advantage. Of course, all of these companies as they grew developed competencies in the other disciplines as they must over time. But I believe what made them successful was continuing to focus on their strengths and becoming best in the business at that one particular discipline.

Four and a half years ago, I left my role at Google as a product manager to join the team at Redpoint. The transition became the biggest professional challenge of my career up to that point. Suddenly, I was working with a smaller team, managing massive ambiguity in job definition, time allocation and decision-making, and giving up the adrenaline of launch day. But far and away my biggest challenge was effective communication. I simply couldn’t articulate my points in convincing ways. During the first few weeks, I felt like an ineffective babbling mess. What had worked at Google was failing at Redpoint. What was the problem? I asked myself enraged. I felt exposed as an incompetent. I had presented tens of times to the executive committee and the higher ups at Google without any problems like these. So I did the only thing I could think of; I spoke to a few friends at consulting companies. After all consultants must deliver persuasive arguments to many different levels of leadership in many industries across disciplines. One friend in particular just handed me a book, which as I found out later is a sort of consulting bible, the Minto Pyramid Principle . The MPP is a book of design patterns for making arguments. It’s what a master computer programmer might have written on the topic of arguments with step-by-step construction. Reading through the MPP I realized my mistake: the communication styles at Google and Redpoint were polar opposites. Google preferred an engineer’s communication methodology, which is the scientific method verbalized. When pitching a new product, I detailed the observations, product hypotheses, experimental design, results and conclusion in that order. The discussion focused mainly on the experimental design and the biases in the results and the implications for the conclusion. Contrast this building structure with the inverted pyramid structure found in journalism, in consulting and at Redpoint which all begin with the conclusion. By starting at the conclusion, the group would decide whether or not to spend any time on a project. If the partners wanted more detail they would ask. This idea is called the inverted pyramid. It’s not new, but it was novel to me. After a few years transitioning from the scientific method to the inverted pyramid, I’ve concluded there is a place for both and the constitution of the audience dictates which to use when. Technical conversations or highly exploratory conversations like product design, engineering design or the like benefit from the scientific method. These conversations require in depth analysis and lots of context setting. But most other types of conversations, internal communications with a company or with the public through press demand a distilled attention grabbing and focusing communication style. There is simply too much noise otherwise. There are some founders and product managers and engineers who can flip between the two techniques effortlessly. They are master communicators because they are fluent in both languages. In retrospect, I think some of the very best leaders have this capacity. Four years on with the inverted pyramid, I have to credit the friend who passed on the Minto book to me. I think about the principle each time I write a post or prepare a memo or speak at a board meeting. I hope you will find it as valuable as I did.

Products aren’t sold in isolation - they exist within ecosystems. Great product market fit and sales pitches hinge on understanding and serving all the members of an ecosystem. Should a product fail to meet the needs of any one member, company success and sales velocity will falter. One tool I use with portfolio companies is the Value Proposition Diagram (VPD) which shows why a product is compelling to every customer - and most products are sold to more than one customer at the same time. I’ll walk through three examples of the VPD: Google AdSense, Expensify and Axial Market. Google AdSense A VPD has three columns: the product, the customers and the value proposition for each customer. Grey arrows represent product pull and green arrows signify revenue flows. One way to think of the VPD is a value chain analysis turned on its head. Google’s AdSense enables publishers to run ads on their websites to generate revenue. Though publishers are the first to come to mind (and the immediate customer), they are the least important component of the ecosystem. The user is the most important. This principle is Google’s first core value: focus on the user and all else will follow. To please the user, ads must be relevant and almost interchangeable with content. Ad relevancy benefits publishers too. Their websites feel disjointed when littered with banner ads of monkeys and hammers. The advertiser follows the user in importance. Advertisers are the source of money in the ecosystem; they pay to make it work. Advertisers prize ROI and as Google proved relevancy drives ROI. That’s the genius of AdSense: ad relevancy aligns the incentives of everyone in the ecosystem. This is the reason it’s such a great product and it sells itself. There is no opponent to the sale within the ecosystem. Expensify Expensify builds expense management systems for SMBs. Like Google, Expensify must serve three customers. But instead of three separate customers, Expensify sells to three internal customers: employees, managers and finance. Expensify has adopted a bottoms-up strategy to win their market segment, so they target the end user who values ease of use. Expensify’s mobile app makes filing expense reports much easier than traditional systems. As employees use Expensify, they request approval of their expenses from their managers. Expense management is a headache for managers who must remind their flock to file them on time. Once submitted, managers must approve expenses and reject those that violate policy. There is often much back and forth. Expensify smooths the friction in this process by telling users which expenses violate policy before submitting their reports, greatly reducing the overhead for managers. Managers file department expense reports with finance. The finance team prizes compliance: ensuring accurate and correct expense reports. With better tools, employees and managers file more of their expenses. Again, Expensify aligns the incentives of the stakeholders in the ecosystem which is the reason for their fast growth. Axial Market ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_166_890045280) The last example is more of a market place model than the previous two. AxialMarket is a network for private company owners to access capital for growth or sale of their company from investors (private equity firms) or acquirors (larger companies). This market is quite opaque at the moment. AxialMarket serves three types of customers: business owners looking to raise capital, M&A brokers/advisors who help business owners find capital, and the sources of capital, strategics and private equity firms. Business owners are looking for the best deal in the market place - the best price for their company or capital at the lowest cost. M&A advisors must find customers, convince them they are the best person for the job and then build a list of financiers and manage the fund raising process to success, ideally. The advisor’s Rolodex is their most valuable asset. The bigger their network, the more successful the advisor will be because they can generate auction pressure for their customers and obtain better prices. AxialMarket offers advisors access to a broader group of investors, much larger than any could maintain individually. And advisors pay for access to this network. On the other side of the market, financiers and acquirers search for the best companies to invest in or purchase. Better visibility coupled to tools that simplify the process are music to their ears. Axial’s network and toolset meets their needs. Summary As you build your product, refine your go-to-market strategy and hone your sales pitch, think through all the customers in an ecosystem that your startup must serve. Ideally, find a way to align their incentives. Knocking down sales friction is the first step to rapid growth. And the VPD is a simple tool for researching, articulating and validating your sales and product assumptions.

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_167_901497663" width="500px"> If you’re like me, you switch task managers every six months at the point that you have added a bunch of items in your list that you’ll never get around to and can’t bear to be reminded of them again. At which point, you conclude that the app has failed you. It must have because you haven’t completed any of these tasks! Task management tools fail users because they operate without context. How many times have you been to the grocery store and forgotten the dill pickles you were asked to buy? Or met someone and tens minutes later realized you forgot to ask an important question? There will be a fundamental change in task management that will actually help me cross items off the list. Task managers will move from an ask-and-ask model to an ask-and-tell model. Today I have to ask the app to create a task and later ask the app to see which tasks to accomplish. It’s a waste of time. The next wave of task managers will ask for two more fields, who and where, in addition to what. This data might also be extracted from a calendar. With this data, the task manager can tell me what to do at the right time. It will surface the grocery list as I cross the geo-fence into the local Safeway and tell me I need to buy a gift for my sister’s birthday when I visit Amazon and notify me of the key question I need to ask that founder when our meeting starts. The task manager failure is one example of “We should be living in the future already” but we aren’t technologies. I think this evolution is around the corner and it will change the way we work and live.

Many of the SaaS companies I work with are buzzing about a new concept: product qualified leads (PQL). It’s typical to see outbound sales teams create new leads by cold-calling - think Glengarry. And marketing also qualifies leads (MQL) using online advertising, branding, content, email and other channels. But the PQL concept is novel. PQLs are potential customers who have used a product and reached pre-defined triggers that signify a strong likelihood to become a paying customer. A hypothetical example at Expensify might be if a user uploads 10 receipts and invites one friend, this user is a PQL and should be sent to the sales team. Each product will have a different definition of a PQL because each product measures engagement differently. Also, the definition will change with time as product usage patterns evolve. The best definitions of PQL are informed by conversion correlation data, eg the behaviors trigger customers to convert paid. PQLs are powerful because they are “free”, scalable, and highly qualified. If a product sells itself, the business wins free customer. (I’m ignoring software development costs and opportunity costs to develop features that may not impact PQL and sales performance directly.) They are scalable because they require no human touch and they are high-quality leads. When the sales team calls PQLs, customers typically convert at about 25 to 30%. Also, PQLs are a fantastic management tool because they align the entire company around one goal: revenue. Typically, the product and engineering teams don’t have goals tied to revenue which bisects a team into revenue generating components (sales and marketing) and cost centers (eng and product). Aside from potentially creating cultural challenges, this structure is less effective than it could be. PQLs pull product and engineering into the fray. Everyone in the company has the same goal. For product and eng teams, PQLs provide a rigorous framework for prioritizing development. Each feature can be benchmarked to determine the net impact to PQL which is ultimately funnel optimization. Of course, a myopic focus on PQL isn’t ideal either. The product and eng teams must balance their revenue goals with new feature development, engagement cultivation, infrastructure upkeep and so on. But product managers should be able to strike a reasonable equilibrium. PQLs provide tremendous leverage for startups by aligning the goals of the product and engineering teams with the rest of the company. Consider implementing them as a management tool in your 2013 plans.

I don’t remember much of junior year chemistry class except the lab experiment in which we made fireworks. My lab partner and I doubled and tripled the amounts of strontium, potassium, calcium and other explosives specified in the instructions. Our firecracker dwarfed our classmates' in size and when we lit them after two unbearable weeks of baking, there was no question we misunderstood chemistry. We expected an inferno and were rewarded with a pathetic fizzle and a C-. We made one critical mistake assembling our pyrotechnics: we failed to add enough oxidizer, the chemical that creates the oxygen to burn all the explosives. Despite all its potential, the firecracker never had a chance. That day I learnt the lesson of the limiting reactant. Startups are a lot like fireworks. To succeed, startups need the right chemistry, they need to be pointed in the right direction and when they work, they’re “on fire.” Startups, too, have the same problem of limiting reactants or limiting factors. Continuously identifying and counteracting these limiting factors is the key to continued growth. At the outset of a startup, engineering throughput can be a limiting factor; the team simply can’t code fast enough. At some point, the product launches but no one knows about it. Marketing is the bottleneck. When customers come rushing through the door, money in hand, sales and customer support might stunt the growth of the company. Other times it’s culture or product market fit or money or competition. But for each startup at every stage there is a limiting factor. A CEO’s most important function as leader of a startup is programmatically searching, finding, and quashing a startup’s limiting factor. The faster a CEO can do this, the faster a startup can grow. Great CEOs anticipate limiting factors and plan ahead, timing new hires with key transitions in a company’s life. Like anything worth doing identifying the limiting factor can be challenging. Advisors and board members can help here.  So can other entrepreneurs who have suffered the same growing pains. But the most important step is to start looking. So, what’s your oxidizer?

Startups are discovery teams - they venture into the abyss, like Shackleton, aspiring to cross the Antarctic, plant a flag and live to tell the tale. Because every expedition is unique, no one knows what will work: product features, marketing tactics, sales pitches, fundraising stories. Nor can the team fully anticipate the precipices and risks: competitive, legal, hiring, market timing and management risks. A philosophy was put to me by a close friend this week. “Succeed despite your every effort to fail.” He meant founders must set lofty goals and challenge themselves and their companies to reach them. The product of such a policy is struggle and consistent failure. At Google, we created objectives and key results each quarter - a goal with a quantifiable result. At the end of the quarter, a score of 60 to 70% was excellent because it communicated ambition and struggle. A score between 80% and 100% indicated sandbagging and incremental thinking. But honestly, we were hustling for the 150% or 200% score because it meant the discovery of a new way of doing things that blew the target out of the water. It meant true innovation and maybe a Founder’s Award The same principle extends to startups. We should be struggling to discover breakout marketing tactics, sales strategies and product features. Ambitious goals and failure must be championed and great successes lauded. Incremental goals drive incremental results. Hence “succeed despite your every effort to fail.”

Hardware competition is cut-throat. Walking through the halls of CES, every Android phone is identical. LG has copied each Samsung model. Because of the competition, tablet prices are plummeting - I saw a $49 7inch tablet ( and some were giving Nexus 7s away for free with subscription. Not constrained to large competitors, startups like FitBit and Jawbone launched competing (and nearly identical) products within weeks of each other: the FitBit Flex and the Jawbone Up Even newer segments like gesture control of TVs or GoPro self-recording cameras are addressed by six competitors, many of them white-label. Software has become the differentiator for all these devices because the hardware is indistinguishable to all but the geekiest. In other words, it’s all about the experience - a concept Apple has championed for almost three decades to great recent success. Unfortunately, many equipment manufacturers lack the skill set to develop compelling software. For example Belkin’s wifi-enabled plugtop “actually makes your house worse” Even the software of the market leader, Apple, is be terrible: “iTunes should die” , “iOS6 Maps is Awful” and as Bijan wrote, every one of the core iOS apps has been replaced with third party software As these OEMs face the challenge of building great software, they must choose among three options:
1. Accept - Co-opt open source software, like Android, and deploy a commodity
2. Ignore - Contract the development to an agency
3. Embrace - Build a software design competency in-house Clearly, the market winners will pursue the last option. Some OEMs may be able to build teams on their own like Samsung. But the majority of manufacturers will look to acquire software design talent to differentiate their commodity hardware products. The return of venture backed hardware startups has engendered a community of companies who have successfully unified talents in hardware and software design: Nest, FitBit, Electric Imp, Jawbone, Sonos, Basis, Leap Motion, Boxee and many more. Crowdfunding has also been a healthy supplier of capital to hybrid companies like Ouya and Pebble among others. Hardware industrial design is no longer a sufficient differentiator for manufacturers. The winners in the next decade will fuse spectacular software design with better but commodity hardware. The fastest path to that end for incumbents is acquisition of startups like these.

There is no prouder boast, but also no better prescription, for executive leadership than the words Andrew Carnegie, the father of the U.S. steel industry, chose for his own tombstone: “Here lies a man who knew how to bring into his service men better than he was himself.” Amen. This epitaph captures succinctly so much of leadership: the ability to articulate a vision and convince others of the importance of that mission; the self awareness of knowing one’s strengths and weaknesses; the desire to be the dumbest guy in the room ; and the capacity to build and maintain those relationships during a life’s work. Carnegie’s noble idea of leadership is one that every manager, founder and VC can aspire to. But it all starts with humility. NB: first paragraph paraphrased from the Effective Executive

In December, I was lucky enough to be asked to become part of the LinkedIn influencer program. I jumped at the opportunity to bring my writing to a broader audience. And the experience has been eye-opening. The influencer program asks a few hundred LinkedIn members to write periodic blog posts which are highlighted on the home page and in email marketing campaigns . LinkedIn staffed a fantastic editorial team who assists writers with content creation and editing, but most importantly, content marketing. The editorial team delivers relevant content to the right people encouraging a virtuous circle between content creators and their audience to form. Quality content breeds engagement and which entices authors to write more (and attracts new authors). All the while, LinkedIn compounds its value. During the past four weeks, I syndicated six posts from this blog to LinkedIn. My LinkedIn stats:
![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_173_469875044) Below are a few observations from that experience: The traffic is tremendous. My median post generated 15k daily visitors, 145 likes and 84 comments - about 15 times the engagement of a post on tomtunguz.com. I needed about three weeks to build a LinkedIn follower count equal in size to Twitter which has been three years in the making. Social networks are the best places for content syndication . What Facebook did for Photos, Tumblr did for (animated) gifs, Twitter did for news, LinkedIn is doing for work content. The same forces that enable these services to quickly build user bases apply to content (both organic and commercial). Relevancy is king. The influencer program succeeds because content is targeted to the user. I’m not sure what tools LinkedIn uses to target content, but I bet the technology is analogous to Google’s ad targeting and parallel to Facebook’s EdgeRank. LinkedIn’s audience is broad and interested in general management/self-help topics. Look at the topics in the stats image above and the trend is clear. Most SaaS startups marketing teams should be writing for this platform. Potential customers number in the millions and the influencer program is a targeted and free way to reach them. LinkedIn should build a CRM. I mine Twitter for business development, and I’d like to do the same on LinkedIn. The same idea holds for companies marketing on LinkedIn with ads and content. LinkedIn knows identity, measures the funnel performance and could store relationship data. I’ll be continuing to blog on LinkedIn. And I’ll also be on the lookout for other forms of social distribution. They are the most powerful forces in content syndication on the Internet today.

In the last 12 years, marketing has been reinvented. No segment has benefitted more from this transformation than startups who have both created the new marketing and leveraged its skills to transform industries. These new marketers creating this wave have been so effective they can delay or even obviate the need for outside sales teams . Historically marketing has been pseudoscience - an undisciplined hand-wavy concoction of story telling and a “throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks” mentality protected by unmeasurable results and three martini lunches. Unlike cash-rich enterprises which bankroll unquantifiable marketing bets, miserly startups can’t afford to gamble. For startups, unit economics are king. A dollar invested must return more than a dollar, much much more. If not, the business simply won’t survive. And this discipline must be applied across the company: engineering, product, sales and marketing. Startups' relentless focus on unit economics compels their marketing departments to invent and discover. Scarcity is the mother of invention. As a result, startups have created every major inflection point in marketing progress in the last decade. In the early 2000s, Google’s AdWords punctuated the wave of real-time quantification of internet ad performance. A few years later, AdSense and others brought performance marketing to the internet broadly. Next, social media marketing blossomed on Facebook and Twitter. Meanwhile, mobile apps created a fundamentally new customer acquisition channel. And of course, email marketing was reborn with Groupon and Fab. With search, web, mobile and social distribution channels built, other startups like Amazon, Zynga and ngMoco were the first to test them, understand them, benchmark them and ultimately exploit them. In addition to advances in advertising performance, these new marketers began influencing product to drive distribution. Rather than intuition, rigorous multivariate testing drives product decisions, yielding small daily optimizations which compound into huge growth.  Dropbox mastered the referral campaign for its consumer storage product. Zynga and Branchout built proficiencies in viral triggers. And LogMeIn perfected the freemium model. The new marketers are a different breed - tenacious, nimble and deft with numbers. They often have backgrounds in finance or consulting and act more like traders than relationship managers, buying media on the fly based on algorithms and using experimental data to inform product decisions. New marketers have revolutionized the go-to-market strategies for startups by acquiring customers scalably and cost-effectively through ROI positive advertising and calculated product improvements. And in today’s entrepreneurial environment, these new marketers represent powerful competitive advantages.

Daniel Pink, former speechwriter for Al Gore, has written an unconventional book on sales called To Sell is Human . In this well researched book, Pink observes a few surprising evolutions in society and their impact on sales. The hard sell is dead . Enabled by the internet, prospective buyers know more about a product than a salesperson. This is true for cars as much as enterprise software. As a result, the salesperson no longer leverages an information asymmetry to sell a product. Instead, the salesperson must negotiate from the very first word, identify a customer problem and solve the problem using a product. Sales is evolving to consulting. The purpose of the pitch is to offer something so compelling that it begins a conversation, brings the other person in as a participant, and eventually arrives at an outcome that appeals to both of you. According to Wharton research, the gun-slinging extroverted salesperson  generates only a fraction more revenue than introverts . Champions of the sales floor balance introversion and extroversion. Dubbed ambiverts, these salespeople sell 25% more than their colleagues. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_175_943160087" width="500px"> Everyone in a company must sell : customer support, marketing, engineering, and so on. Atlassian and Zendesk have reached tens to hundreds of millions in revenue without sales teams by empowering customer support teams to solve the problems of an educated customer base. In addition, more than 18M Americans work independently, a figure that will quadruple in the next ten years. More than most, this segment of the workforce must sell effectively to thrive. The term elevator pitch originates from the very first demonstration of an elevator with a safety brake . At the time, elevators were hazardous, routinely plummeting down shafts when their hoisting ropes fell, destroying their payloads. In 1852, Elisha Otis invented a locking system that would catch and secure plunging elevator. Unable to drive much interest in his innovation, Otis organized a demonstration in New York City. He stood in the elevator as an assistant severed the hoisting ropes and the safety brake engaged. Otis' innovation paved the way for humans to ride in elevators. Today, the Otis company’s products transport 7B people every three days. To Sell is Human is a breezy, data supported book that catalogues the changes in sales and shares techniques to improve sales performance.

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_176_667353327" width="500px"> We should be living in the future already. I should be controlling my home lights from my phone. My coffee machine should reorder coffee from Amazon automatically and my washing machine should schedule its own maintenance. This kind of future demands that machines act with human intelligence. I’m asking my coffee machine to think like me, so that I don’t have to. But we aren’t living in this world yet because it requires the synchronized deployment of three of the most advanced technologies developed in the past 20 years: wireless communication, smart phones and machine learning. First, all these devices must be connected to the internet via Wifi or cellular connection. This means the manufacturers of these devices must design, integrate, test and ship internet devices. Many manufacturers have started to believe in the benefits of subscription revenue economics and ongoing data collection from devices in the field. But hardware design cycles are measured in months and years. In addition until recently the market lacked technologies to help manufacturers build great software for their devices , hence the delay. Second, the broad adoption of smart phones and the vibrant application ecosystems have enabled and trained users to interact with new devices. More than half of Americans own a smart phone meaning the target market for connected devices is about 150M in this country alone and represent an attractive segment for device manufacturers. The market is primed. Last, with the infrastructure to connect devices to the internet and the applications to monitor and control them in place, the most important challenge remains: machine learning. Deep learning technologies will use the data aggregated from devices to enable human-like intelligence, unlocking the magic of the connected devices vision. The advances seen in machine learning in the past few years have shown unprecedented gains as a result of increased processing power and better access to data. Google Now and Siri are just two examples. When machines anticipate needs and wants and solve problems without consulting their owners, we will be living in the future. I believe the infrastructure, the revenue model, the customer base and the deep learning techniques are finally ready to enable entrepreneurs to seize the opportunity and build the future.

Communication is essential to the success of every startup. Startup teams collaborate in product and engineering conversations, in general management, and in recruiting. Externally, startups sell customers using marketing and sales. Startups also pitch investors during fundraising conversations. Clearly, great communication makes demands of the audience. But effective communication is challenging. One of my favorite communication tools is a framework created by management guru Peter Drucker of three fundamentals: perception, expectation and clear demand. Perception means understanding the audience: their worldview, the language they use, their motivations and their problems. Developing a deep perception of the audience often means listening which takes many forms including market research, the conversations, one-on-one conversations with reports and so on. Expectation means knowing the frame of mind of the audience - what they  expect from a conversation. Violating expectations can be used as a sales technique to change a customer’s frame of mind when evaluating different products. While other PC makers fight a market share war based on price/performance, Apple uses design to change the rules of engagement. Other times violating expectations can be more challenging, for example, delivering a negative feedback review to an employee with a different perception of his work. Clear demand is the ask. Once the audience’s perception and expectation are understood, the communicator must understand her own goal of the conversation, eg closing a sale or relaying ideas for how to improve an employee’s performance. The audience’s perception and expectation must be used to frame the demand for it to be effective. They are the keys to encoding the demand in an effective way. Frameworks like these can be a bit esoteric. But ultimately, this is a tool to determine the best way to relay a message to an audience by first understanding them well, then determining your goal of the conversation and last by framing the goal using the audience’s language and comparing or contrasting expectations.

About three years ago, I started journaling my startup education by blogging. In retrospect, blogging has been one of the most rewarding activities for me as an investor. Blogging helps me some observe changes in the start-up ecosystem, communicate trends primarily through data while strengthening and building relationships. It’s been more gratifying than I could have hoped. Over the past year, quite a bit has happened on this blog. I’ve tried to write a post every working day on both tactical topics for startups like fundraising and management and macro/strategic subjects like the fund raising market and trends in mobile. During that time, a small community has grown around the blog for which I’m very grateful.  Traffic on the blog has grown from about 2,000 visitors per month in January to about 30,000 visitors per month in December. I find it hard to believe the growth. It’s all thanks to you, bold entrepreneurs and intrepid founders who continue to chase big ideas, tackle challenging problems, dare to dream of disruption and innovation - and provide an unending supply of inspiration. Also, this blog wouldn’t be possible without the love, support and editing of my beautiful wife. Thank you all for making 2012 a memorable year. Below is a list of the top ten posts I wrote this year measured by traffic and engagement on social media - a best of. I hope you enjoy it.

It’s easy to call a tablet a larger a mobile phone. Or a replacement for a notebook or ultrabook. But to dismiss tablets as scaled clones of their bigger and smaller brothers is a mistake. Tablets are the third type of device: the one with the most revenue potential for ecommerce and developers alike. Tablets drive greater volumes of traffic, that convert to paid at better rates, and drive better qualified and less expensive leads through advertising. Despite the fact that tablet penetration is less than half of smart phone penetration in the US , tablets' share of traffic to websites outpaced mobile web in Q1 2012. And with tablet penetration doubling year over year, that trend is certain to continue. More impressively, overall tablet users' conversion rates are twice as strong as mobile phones and 20% better than PCs . And because the ecosystem is young, tablet ads' costs-per-click are low, generating much better ROI for advertisers, a winning combination for marketers. Reading through EF’s report, the ROI metrics are even more favorable for merchants. Longer session times during non-working hours drive this higher propensity to convert. In addition, tablet demographics are much more attractive. According to Flurry , tablet owners also skew disproportionately older and wealthy with a 18 percentage point skew towards households with income exceeding $50k and a nearly 10 percentage points skew towards 55 and older users, compared to smartphones. Not every application category will benefit from pursuing tablets. But the form factor, usage patterns, customer acquisition economics and demographics will confer tablet-first companies a unique advantage that isn’t yet evident in the market.

When I started working at Google, I heard the word generalist over and over. “We only hire generalists,” I was told. Eight years later this mantra is pretty common. I hear it often both referring to the desired characteristics of new hires and also the aspirations of a team - “we want to be a team of generalists”. At the time, I understood the word generalist to mean someone really good at a lot of things. In computer science, it might mean an engineer who is great at Javascript, CSS, HTML, Java, Rails, MapReduce, NodeJS - familiar with every technology up and down the stack. But these engineers are unicorns - they’re mythical. Even if I were to find one, how could an interview possibly screen for such depth of knowledge? And is a walking technical encyclopedia really the right fit for a startup? Reading through Drucker’s Effective Executive, I came across this passage which I think is a much better definition: The only meaningful definition of a “generalist” is a specialist who can relate his own small area to the universe of knowledge. Peter Drucker In other words, a generalist is someone has demonstrated learning one field, who has an open mind and who can articulate relationships between known domains and new ideas. A team built of these types of people would be a great fit for a startup - smart, flexible thinkers who communicate well. Startups bob and weave. They change architectures and products and markets and tactics. Startups need teams who can change the tires on the bus as it’s traveling at 60 mph; they need a team of MacGyvers, who combine a little bit of knowledge, a wad of gum(ption) from their pocket and some raw smarts to solve a problem. That’s my kind of generalist.

The famous global macro hedge fund manager George Soros once said, “I don’t play the game by a particular set of rules; I look for changes in the rules of the game.” Inside the House of Money Soros' insight is equally well applied to startups. Successful startups discover and leverage changes in the rules of the game. Discovering the changes in the rules of the game is one of the hardest things about starting a company, but understanding precisely the change and developing a hypothesis for exploiting the change is essential. Typically, there are three types of changes in the rules of the game that startups pursue: technology discontinuities, ecosystem discontinuities, and behavioral discontinuities. Technology discontinuities , those changes in the rules that occur as a result of new technology are often the most apparent. Clay Christensen’s smaller hard drives is the classic example. More recently big data technologies like MapReduce, OpenFlow Networking, enterprise grade flash storage and NoSQL databases represent fundamental advances in technology. Technology discontinuities afford opportunities first in commercializing new technologies (MapR, Pure Storage, BigSwitch) and second capitalizing upon them as advantages in other, pre-existing markets (risk modeling in financial services and real time bidding ad tech, for example). Ecosystem discontinuities arise when the costs to serve customers in a sector suddenly change dramatically. In the last five years, social media and mobile app distribution have built platforms offering unparalleled access to billions of customers at a fraction of the cost of highly efficient search advertising. This fundamental change in the rules has spawned tens if not hundreds of fast growing social and mobile companies like Pinterest, Kabam, PocketGems and others. Ecosystem discontinuities typically offer short term customer acquisition advantages for first-movers and fast learners. Whoever can learn the new rules of the game the quickest will win. Behavioral discontinuities are the most nuanced and subtle changes in the rules of the game. They require entrepreneurs to examine and extrapolate small changes in user behavior into new opportunities and build precisely the product that enables users to say, “Yes, that’s exactly what I needed.” Behavior changes typically start very small and then grow quite quickly. Social networking represents a fundamental shift in communication patterns that started by satisfying two human desire, curiosity and vanity, and provided the substrate for a massive behavioral change. Behavioral discontinuities require a deep understanding of changing user wants and needs. These are often discovered through self-observation, introspection or field research. Other discontinuities: Of course there are many other types of discontinuities. Swings in the financial markets both public and private, government regulation and antitrust rulings, industry consolidation, and so on. And there are myriad ways uncovering these discontinuities. But common to most startups is the successful identification of a discontinuity and hypothesis for how to exploit it. Discovering the changes in the rules of the game may take years of observation or it can happen in a flash. It can happen in any number of ways. But ultimately, it’s what we’re all chasing.

Email and most meetings aren’t work. We all know this to be true. But huge swaths of our days are allocated to meetings and answering email. It’s impossible to accomplish much aside from information dissemination. A close friend, who like me is a productivity nut, asked me a question that made this point clearly: What fraction of your day is spent in meetings you asked for compared to meetings that were asked of you? I didn’t know the answer but I calculated it. I was disheartened by the result.  Over the past three weeks, my ratio is 6 to 4. For every 6 minutes I spend in a meeting I arranged, I spent 4 in a meeting I was invited to. What is your ratio? And what should it be? Presuming meetings I request are more productive than meetings I’m invited to (because I’m driving the agenda and accomplishing my goals), if I could shift that ratio by just one minute to 7 to 3, I would improve my productivity by 17%. The bigger the company, the worse the problem becomes. Last week, I chatted with a friend who joined had just joined a large company. He found his team to be incredibly unproductive even though his reports were smart. After he asked the team to their tasks in 30 minute blocks, he realized 6 of every 8 hours of their days were spent either responding to emails to attending irrelevant meetings. In other words, it took four employees to accomplish the work of one focused worker. With the new year around the corner, it’s that time to make New Year’s Resolutions. My theme in 2013 is “return to fundamentals.” Set objectives and key results by quarter. These are clear goals with quantifiable metrics. For example, spending 50% of my time helping portfolio companies. Block the time every week on my calendar to achieving these goals. Control my calendar to make sure I’m maximizing my meeting ratio (as mentioned above). Prepare for meetings. Send agendas with precise questions, agendas and rough timings for each item ahead of time. Measure and tune. I’m going to track these time allocation metrics and my productivity goals. I hope to improve my focus and have a more positive impact with my teams. Email and meetings consume big chunks of time. And though it’s easy to convince ourselves they’re productive, they aren’t. It’s hard work that moves companies forward.  Time to get back to fundamentals.

I call the last working week in December Board Week because it’s packed with board meetings. These board meetings are often the most important of the year. By virtue of their place on the calendar, everyone in the room is thinking more strategically, less tactically. These meetings set the tone and strategy for the company for the upcoming year. I’ve assembled a checklist below of top 5 things I’ve seen founders do in and around the end of the year that position their companies for success in the next year. An annual post-mortem. What the company accomplished in the last year? What went well? What could the company have done better? This post-mortem is created by the management team with input from the company as a whole. Afterwards, the findings are presented to the board and the company in an all hands. Team evaluations. Pick a flavor: peer reviews, 360 degree evaluations or management reviews, annual reviews are essential to honest cultures in startups. Annual reviews are the best time to evaluate compensation, reward the top performers and begin to manage under-performers out of the organization. OKR setting . I’m a avid proponent of the OKR (objective and key result) model where the company leadership sets three measurable, quantitative goals for the year. Managers divide those three goals into smaller goals for themselves and so on down the organization. Andy Grove pioneered this at Intel and we used it to great effect at Google . This management technique aligns all the efforts in a company toward the goals. The three things we’re worried about. This is a critical part of the checklist. Board members, founders and management team are each worried about issues facing the business. But are they worried about the same issues? Ensuring that each understands the challenges of the other and that the team is prioritizing the same top three concerns grounds communication and focuses the company on the hardest challenges. A financial plan for next year including a headcount plan, a sales plan (if applicable) and a forecast for out of cash date and timing of next fundraise. Financial plans are the ambitions of the company codified in numbers. They help with scenario planning, goal setting, company alignment and team measurement. In addition, an options pool plan to ensure the company has enough in its employee stock option pool to continue to hire, retain and reward employees. For startups, founders and VCs, the end of the year is a good time for introspection, evaluation and communication. Structuring this tasks has helped our companies become more productive. I hope they help your business too. Email me with other suggestions if you have them and I’ll publish them tomorrow.

Great teams accomplish amazing things. But it’s rare for any founding team to have all the constituent parts on the day they start the company. Most startups will need to build a strong management team whose strengths and knowledge complement the founding team. Finding the right people to help starts with being honest. As Swizec of Zemanta wrote yesterday, there simply isn’t enough time in the day for founders to manage all the key parts of a startup: BD, hiring, fundraising, goal setting, product management and company management in addition to coding . But words “building a management team” evoke anxiety in many founders I meet. Below is the process I’ve seen work well at many of our portfolio companies. The process Assessing the team The first part of building a management team is performing an honest assessment of the strengths, weaknesses and personal goals of the founders. In other words, “What kinds of people does this person need around him/her to be successful?” Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Great teams have individuals who complement each others weaknesses' with strengths - as a result, they team becomes a force multiplier for the business. A founder may be a great technologist who is passionate about architecture and technology, but needs help managing team. A founder may be a great salesperson and leader who wants to remain in the field and needs help managing product and engineering. A founder may be a great general manager but needs help scaling the business, managing all the different parts of the company efficiently. Every situation is unique. But common to each, the key element for growth is building a trusted team. Defining the role The second part of building the team is defining the ideal candidate’s strengths and weaknesses. These parameters fall out naturally from the founder strength assessment and the demands of the role. Often, it’s helpful to speak with other founders who have hired similar candidates or hire an expert recruiter to guide the process and build a candidate pipeline. Easiest of all is to point to someone in the ecosystem and say, “We want to hire someone exactly like that person!” Finding candidate/team fit Just like product/market fit, candidate/team fit is the most important characteristic of building the management team. Open communication, trust and shared vision are the sine qua non of a new management hire. They are essential. Management team candidates should spend lots of time with the company meeting as many of the team as possible in as many different environments as possible (team meetings, offsites, crises) to build rapport, understanding and trust. Matrix Multiplication Management teams are the infrastructure upon which great companies are built. Underinvesting in them will hamper growth and leave founders scrambling to find the time to code, design product, and the six hundred other items on their task list. But laying the right foundation and making the right investments can drive exponential growth.

Tech startups write a ton of code. Broadly speaking, most of that code base is customer facing. But to be successful, the product must be supported by a litany of great “invisible” technology - the internal tools and products that help a company scale. They are the skeleton of the startup. At Google, there were hundreds if not thousands of small internal tools built to solve problems. CRM tools, email automation tools with canned responses, lead prioritization tools, project databases, weekly snippets for reporting, email lists, and so on. We built these tools following Larry’s advice to his teams which was to find a problem or inefficiency, generalize it as much as possible, then build a tool to automate it and then tune it over time. It was the only way we could scale. In AdSense operations, the average account manager supported more than 10,000 customers (!) because of the tools. Like Google, startups build many of these tools in house. Sometimes, they purchase off the shelf solutions. In either case, these essential supporting cast members enable startups to grow much faster. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_185_680064578) I think about a startup’s toolkit in three buckets: First, technology tools ensure high quality code and a responsive product: Developer tools - regression testing, continuous deployment (CircleCi) Operational tools - deployment management (Puppet), application performance management (New Relic, Crittercism) Second, marketing and sales tools build and manage customer pipelines: Marketing tools - email performance (Sailthru, Userfox), social media monitoring (HootSuite) Sales tools - CRM (Salesforce, Streak), webinar tools, salespitch tools (ClearSlide), salesforce education tools (Bloomfire), customer support (Zendesk) Third, financial and BI tools help the company measure and forecast: BI tools - website data (Mixpanel), core business metrics (Gooddata, Datameer, Periscope) HR tools - performance management and recruitment (Workday, JobVite, Lever)
Financial tools - planning and analysis (Tidemark), expense management (Expensify), Billing (Zuora) These tools provide the infrastructure for startups to grow rapidly but this is an area where startups continuously underinvest. Trying to change the tires on the bus as it’s traveling 60 miles an hour is tough - but it’s worth the investment. The bus will travel faster. Every quarter, take a step back, examine your internal processes and make sure that your teams are building the invisible infrastructure that will help your startup blossom.

Performance marketing is a skill every startup should hone as a core competency as quickly as possible. Performance marketing creates a process where $1 invested in the business creates greater than $1 in output - a growth machine. Building a growth engine The goal of performance marketing is simple: to determine, as precisely as possible, the expected value of every current and potential user. This data enables the marketing team to know exactly how much they should be willing to pay to acquire the user. Or how much to incent a current user to upgrade. Or pursue some other action like invite a friend or share a tweet. The expected value of a customer changes dynamically as a function of the amount and kind of data a startup can collect about a user. The more data, the better the expected value prediction. The challenge, of course, is building the system to calculate a user’s expected value. Problems like these are perfect for statistical analysis and machine learning. Because engineering is often the limiting factor in most startups, and new features or bug fixes are top priority, engineering marketing solutions is often under-prioritized. But building a simple generalized linear model isn’t incredibly complex. It can be done in three steps in R, as I’ve been learning over the past few weeks. First, gather the data To create a model, we need to create a spreadsheet of customer behavior and data by column and save it as a csv. Here is a Google Doc of random data that might serve as a good start for a SMB SaaS company building a Yammer competitor. Second, create a linear model in R After installing and configuring R , building a model is trivial. It takes three lines of code. ac <- read.csv("~/marketing/accountCohort.csv") #load the data
lm.ac = lm(formula = Revenue ~  ., data = ac[,2:7]) #build a model to predict revenue
summary(lm.ac) #spits out the performance data of the model The first line ingests the data into R. The second line creates a basic multivariate linear model to predict the Revenue column using the six other variables. And the third spits out summary stats. Third, evaluate the model I’ve copied a sample set of summary statistics below. The most important single number is in the second to last line: the Adjusted R-Squared which is 0.909 in this case. This number indicates the percent of variability my model predicts. Rule of thumb: this number needs to be above 0.9 to be a good predictor of revenue. This model clearly is a good predictor, explaining 91% of the variance. The data in the coefficients table indicates which variables are good predictors of revenue with the number of asterixes at the end of the line. In this case Replies Created and Mobile Logins are terrible predictors. But all the others are quite good. Call:
lm(formula = Revenue ~ ., data = ac[, 1:15])

In fact, the challenging part in modeling isn’t actually telling the computer to build the model. Instead, it’s finding the features (the columns of data) that accurately predict customer value. If my model hadn’t worked, I would have needed to add other data to the csv and run the model again. With a tuned model, it’s possible to predict the value of a given user (or millions of users) with one line of code, R’s predict function. Once we know the revenue potential of a user, we know how much we might be willing to pay to incent the user to perform certain actions. And we have built a framework for performance marketing.

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/"> Believe it or not, this pig has a Twitter account, @impeePiggy . Whenever someone drops change into the pig, the pig counts the change using an optical sensor, increments the savings and tweets the value of its contents using an electric imp . This deceptively intelligent pig has a lot to do with disruption: In a conversation with renowned Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen about the newspaper industry, Joshua Benton remarked, “The perception of the incoming disruptors is that they are low quality, and therefore not really worth paying attention to.” Let’s pay attention Craig Mod’s “Subcompact Publishing” Why pay attention to this pig? Big technology changes start as hobby projects, seemingly trivial applications of new technologies that quickly morph into movements. Apple began at the Home Brew Computer Club when “computer clubs [continued] to form around the county” in places like Montana. Ruby on Rails grew in popularity because programmers started using the framework for their side projects which rapidly grew into production software. Google AdSense’s internal CRM is a Rails app called Toothpaste that I cobbled together one (late) night that now serves the global team. In the same way as Apple and Rails blossomed from communities of tinkerers, hardware is back in vogue as a hobby and growing quickly as a movement . I wrote in July, we’re seeing the return of venture backed hardware startups which means investors are supporting these new initiatives. Even public market investors like Dan Ramsden see this wave approaching. It’s my great hope that technologies like electric imp can be the platform which piggy banks use to communicate to the web and ultimately disrupt the biggest banks. Or something like that.

Over lunch last week, a good friend who is an entrepreneur and I were brainstorming about the features of his optimal initial target market. His product hasn’t yet launched so he still had some decisions to make about which users and use cases to target. We wondered if there were a rule of thumb about initial target customer segments. We took out a blank sheet of paper and came up with this: Ideal Customer = max (DAU / MAU) Rapid iteration from informed feedback The best first customers are the most active customers - the ones who will use your product on a daily basis - or as close to a daily basis as possible. Active customers provide three key pieces of feedback: ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_188_186557964" width="500px"> First, their activity rate proves the product solves their need. In other words, these users validate product/market fit. Second, these power users can readily articulate the product’s shortcomings and because they use the product on a daily basis, this feedback is fast and frequent. This enables the product team to make small daily course changes to fine-tune the product and inform the longer term product roadmap. Third, active users are the best to test pricing because they understand the value of the product since it solves their need. It’s simple for them to express their willingness to pay. The second most important characteristic Ideally, this highly active user base also is part of a tightly knit community, one in which word spreads quickly. Active users tend also to be the most vocal users and the biggest proponents of a product. I don’t always build product, but when I do I pick my customer segments Fast feedback cycles are fundamental to great product development. The best users use the product with maximum frequency, generate usage data for analysis and also provide product feedback to drive the product toward product market fit faster. When choosing your initial target customer segment, focus on daily users.

Jeff Bezos appeared on Charlie rose two weeks ago and spoke about Amazon’s history, future and best of all, its culture. In the interview, Bezos discussed Amazon’s core values: We are willing to be misunderstood We are obsessed with customers, not competitors. We are long term thinkers While all of them are critical to Amazon’s success, my favorite is the first because it combines three critical concepts for startups. First, it requires knowing a secret, in the Peter Thiel sense of the word, seeing something in the market that very few others understand. Second, it requires systems thinking , understanding where a new product fits into the market place and how to leverage a company’s assets to best deliver the product to customers. Third, it requires conviction, belief in the product and market even when others are deriding the notion and investors are pushing the company to achieve quarterly targets. This is the willingness to be misunderstood. Today, it’s not technology that creates barriers to entry in a market. Amazon Web Services has radically reduced the costs of deploying software. Instead, culture, process and institutional knowledge create the moats. Culture attracts talent. Process builds expertise, the institutional knowledge that allows a company to serve a customer best. When you think about your startup, make sure you have all three ingredients: a secret, a strong go-to-market strategy and the willingness/conviction to be misunderstood. These are the foundations of great companies.

I rowed crew in college. I walked on to the team and fell in love with the sport the very first time we pushed the boat from the dock and took a stroke. Looking back on those four years, I often draw parallels between rowing and entrepreneurship. My freshman year, Joe Holland, who had raced for the national team in the eighties had taken a sabbatical to coach the freshmen team. He was a master and he loved the philosophy of rowing as much as the sport. When I asked him how he became such a great athlete, he said, “I made sure I was always the slowest guy in the boat. I knew I could push myself much harder if I needed to keep up with the fastest guys.” Eight years later, I started at Redpoint. One afternoon, Tim Haley, one of our partners, told me the founding story of Netflix. Tim focused on one key component to the success of the company. From the very first days,  Reed Hastings had set about building a management team of experts in particular fields like operations (for managing DVD logistics), product management and marketing. When the management team gathered, Reed wanted to be the dumbest guy in the room. In fact, reading through Netflix’s culture slides , you’ll find gems like: Imagine if everyone at Netflix is someone you respected and could learn from Adequate performance gets a generous severance package We are a pro-sports team: We have stars in every position competing for a fixed number of seats This management philosophy is fundamental to great teams, both in sports and in business. By surrounding ourselves with people who are skilled in their fields, each striving to be better, challenging each other, we can accomplish great things.

When going to market, startups tend to pursue one of two sales strategies, either education sales or execution sales.These sales strategies are substantially different. They demand different sales cycles, pricing and market positioning - potentially even different team members. The Education Sale If your customers don’t know they need your product yet, then the sales process is an education sale. Education sales are common when creating a new market (TiVo inventing the DVR) or when bringing existing technologies to new market segments (CRM for restaurants). Education sales demand great product marketing. The product’s value proposition must be encapsulated in one concrete, succinct idea. How do you explain the value of a DVR to someone who has never used one? “Watch your favorite shows whenever you want” or “Skip all the ads.” Testing the effectiveness of marketing messages is essential. Education sales require longer sales cycles. It takes time to convince potential customers that they need the product. Customers ask questions about basic functionality. These conversations are often consultative, with salespeople asking about problems and matching the strengths of the product to those needs - also called solutions selling. Additionally, the main goal during education sales isn’t necessarily to optimize revenue, but maximize initial customer success to win reference customers that drive additional business. The Execution Sale If your startup is entering an existing market and competing with a better value proposition (10x better, faster, cheaper), then the sales focus is execution. Execution sales require great sales marketing (product differentiation). Sales pitches are characterized by sophisticated customer questions since they have already been educated by the first-to-market vendors. Instead of objection handling, conversations with customers focus on trade-offs. Many times these sales processes are bake-offs with several vendors competing for the same business. This contrast could be much better design (Sonos in audio equipment) or much lower cost (Pure Storage in flash storage) or better technology (TideMark in business intelligence). The main goal of execution sales is maximizing sales velocity, market share and revenue. In other words, revenue yield optimization. Which sales process when? To maximize the impact of your startup’s sales and marketing teams, match the sales process to the market and customer base.

In this month’s HBR, Clay Christensen and Maxwell Wessell published an article targeted to the CEOs of large companies on how to prevent disruption to their businesses. They point to five major barriers to competition in a market listed in increasing order of difficulty to assail.  Instead of reviewing the incumbent’s strategy, I’m going to flip these around to reverse engineer these defenses and build a startup’s playbook for disruption with examples from our portfolio. The inertia barrier: When entering a market, a startup has to convince a customer the value of switching is greater than the switching costs including building a new relationship, implementing a new provider and training. The tech-implementation barrier: Startups should leverage their nimbleness and focus to bring a better product to market faster. Ex. Expensify is building a mobile-first expense reporting solution with great OCR and a better customer experience. By iterating quickly and responding to customer needs, Expensify is outpacing its competition and winning market share. The ecosystem barrier: Products don’t exist in a vacuum. Startups need to build and master their go-to-market strategy. This means building core competencies in sales and marketing, in addition to striking the right partnerships. Ex. Electric Imp must build an ecosystem of vendors to succeed. Without OEMs integrating our technology, the company cannot get their product to market. The new technologies barrier: Sometimes, startups have to develop new technologies to enter a market. This is particularly true when incumbents are already competing with each other with commodity goods and use price as a differentiator. Ex. Pure Storage has built software to enable cheaper, but more failure-prone consumer flash drives to achieve the quality of service enterprises demand. The business model barrier: By radically altering the cost of sales or cost to serve a customer, startups can decimate incumbents. Ex. Netflix’s DVD distribution business didn’t require the massive capex and real estate investment of Blockbuster. ThredUp is challenging brick-and-mortar consignment in the same way. The linchpin of every business is deeply understanding customer needs and building a product that solves problems. Combining a passion for the right design with a play from the playbook above is key to disrupting a market.

Call it what you like. The Series A Crunch or Silicon Valley’s Financial Cliff, there’s a lot of talk about the challenge seed stage companies facing insurmountable odds raising Series A investment - PandoDaily’s analysis pegs the odds at 20% based on anecdotal data. The three horsemen of the seedpocalypse In the past 3 years, the three major trends influencing the seed market are: The decreasing cost of starting a company is balanced by growing labor costs. Seed companies must still raise Series As to scale. Macroeconomic factors, namely the challenging job market for young professionals, are pushing people towards entrepreneurship. Incubators have arisen to provide education and a fundraising launching pad for these young founders. Politicians and the media have stoked this trend. Rising valuations at every stage and the fear of missing out led VCs to invest in the seed market - and more precisely, index the seed market by investing in 50 to 60 companies per year. VCs' relative price insensitivity (relative to angels) has skewed the pricing in the angel market. As a result, some angels have moved to other markets or moved up-market, raising larger funds to compete. These three forces have created the impression, right or wrong, that there is a huge wave of seed companies in the market who all need to raise Series As. To be clear, we don’t have any data showing that the rate of company formation has changed. Nor do we have any (accurate) data on the net change in dollars commanded by seed investments as VCs have piled in and angel investors have retrenched. Observed seed investment data indicates the outlook is stable, if not optimistic Data on the seed market is notoriously bad. Many seeds are unreported. But let’s assume the data bias has remained relatively constant over the past 17 years. Above is a chart of US VC investments (in number, not investment size) normalized by stage since 1997 using data from the NVCA. If our assumption about the data quality is correct, then it’s reasonable to conclude that the volume of seed investment has either remained constant or slowed since 2009. But the fear over the pace of Series A investments declining isn’t borne out in the data. This slowing is true both on relative measures and absolute counts. In particular, Series As have grown in volume while Seeds, Bs and Cs have remained flat. The key: dollars at exit > dollars invested Ultimately, the health of the fund raising market is determined by how much capital VCs and angels can raise to invest. Dollars entering the asset class have remained relatively constant, as the chart below shows. Should the seed market produce an outsized quantity of disruptive startups creating huge amounts of value, I have no doubt the follow-on capital for Series A, B and C would be there to support the company. LPs' investment allocations ensure that this will happen. And so would the forces of capitalism. Is this the end of the world the Mayans predicted? No, it’s not. The admittedly biased data we do have indicate the seed market is still relatively healthy. Seed volumes are relatively constant, Series A investments are growing and capital is entering the ecosystem at a constant rate. An entrepreneur’s takeaways When raising a seed round, make sure to raise enough to achieve milestones that will enable the company to raise a Series A - typically this means 18 months' of burn. Remember to match your seed stage startup ambitions with the fund size of your target investor. There is enough capital to invest in many great companies at the Series A stage. To wit, Series A volumes are increasing.

Yesterday, I showed the increasing share of venture capital investments consumer companies represent . But examining the trends at a category level may mask patterns by consumer category and also by stage. So, I’ve created two charts: the first is a bar chart of consumer investment by segment and the second is a heatmap of of sector and stage. I categorized the consumer investments by 10 leading firms over the past 18 months into six buckets of my choosing. Consumer services and ecommerce represent 70% dollars invested Consumer services and e-commerce companies are the biggest recipients of investment. Combined, these two segments represent 70% of dollars invested and 60% of deals by volume. In addition to being the most common, consumer services average deal size is $36M, 50% larger than commerce and social media deals at $24M, implying this segment fetches the greatest valuations. Consumer services investments have boomed because of the growth of smartphones enabling innovation in transportation and the rise of socially enabled services built on Facebook and Twitter’s distribution mechanisms. Ecommerce has witnessed a surge in investments in the past few years with the rise of couponing, subscription commerce and vertically integrated commerce. Given the challenges of many of these companies, I suspect this trend to reverse. Series A is the most vibrant stage for consumer investments Above is a heatmap indicating the number of consumer investments in the past 18 months broken down by Series and Sector. S indicates seed rounds. 54% of investments made by these firms in the past 18 months are Series As. Only 11% are Series Bs.  About 22% are seeds (though this figure is likely far too low since many seeds are unreported). As for category observations, ecommerce and consumer services command the lion’s share of investments, as we saw in the chart above. Media and gaming seems to be a category with particularly high follow on fund raising risk. Early stage consumer investment is bustling Despite the relatively small sample set of about 270 transactions, the trends are clear. VCs continue to invest in early stage ecommerce and consumer services companies. Sector explanations - Example companies Consumer services: AirBnB, TaskRabbit and Uber Ecommerce: Fab, HotelTonight, Warby Parker Social media: Pinterest, Path, NextDoor Media [& gaming]: Tiny Speck, Rovio, Machinima Education: 2Tor, CourseEra

Fred Wilson’s perspectives on trends in consumer web investment created a big brouhaha over the weekend. Commenting on a WSJ article , Wilson offered his confirmatory observations that follow-on investments in the consumer web have become more challenging as momentum investors have shifted toward enterprise. Over the past 18 months, valuations of later stage consumer internet companies have ballooned into the hundreds of millions propelled by enormous user growth. For many of these startups, revenue hasn’t been able to keep pace with rising serving costs. It’s not surprising that some members of the eight figure valuation club can’t raise follow-on rounds at even greater premiums - the economics can be challenging. It took YouTube something like seven years to break-even. But is this the story for all consumer web? Is the drought of consumer investment capital experienced by the internet monoliths common to earlier startups? What fraction of investment dollars have moved to enterprise? I’ve aggregated data from the NVCA from 1995 to Q3 2012 to answer these questions in two charts. Consumer web’s share of all US VC investment is increasing Historically, enterprise investments have been the bread and butter of venture firms, representing about 52% of dollars invested over the last 17 years. So a focus on enterprise isn’t new. Instead, the rise of consumer deals is the trend. And across all major sectors of VC investment (consumer, enterprise, healthcare and energy), consumer investments are growing their share. Since 1995, consumer deals have on median commanded 14.7% of VC dollars. Through Q3 2012, that share has grown to 16.8%, indicating the consumer venture market is growing or stable. In 2004, for every 1 consumer investment, VCs invested in 10 enterprise companies. Today that ratio is 1:3. Consumers share growth is also evident when compared just to enterprise investments.  After the bubble burst, enterprise deals outnumbered consumer deals 9 to 1. Since the bottom in 2003-2004, consumer deals have increased their share of venture dollars growing by 250% to about 25%. 
![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_195_833869424) Despite these shifts in share and market volatility, there hasn’t been a statistically significant difference in the number of investments or dollars invested comparing 2012 investment activity to the past 17 years. The party is just getting started Despite the sentiment expressed by Fred and the WSJ about the challenging situation of consumer internet follow-on investments for high-fliers, the rest of the consumer web startup scene seems to be thriving.

Department stores. Computer software. And even education. Products and services are being broken into their atomic units and optimized for price, selection, features and, most importantly, customer satisfaction. This is an inexorable trend that cannot and should not be stopped. Roger Ehrenberg in a post called “The Great Unbundling” This unbundling is happening. But I’m not convinced it’s every consumer’s desire to consume media or purchase clothing a la carte. Or that this is the end state of commerce. Instead, the future is a hybrid model. And it’s already in market. In the bundled world, consumers only chose from the products an editor had selected. Editors are paid to sift through the morass of choices, curating a subset for consumption. Department stores, record stores, newspapers, etc. Unbundling is attractive because it replaces an opaque curation process with transparency. In the unbundled world, consumers can browse every conceivable product. But in exchange for choice, unbundling imposes massive time costs on consumers. Given access to every product, which one is the best for me? How might I even begin to decide which is the best for me? Sometimes consumers just buy the brand of product over and over - like their jam or jelly . But for many products sold on the web like music, clothing, movies the decision is more complicated. Consumers want variety of good quality choices which requires research and time. There are always new styles of clothing and music and new movies. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_196_874056774" width="500px"> Take music. At some point, it takes too much time to discover new music and users stop creating new playlists on services like Spotify and Rdio and become bored with these service. This is the paradox of choice. For this reason, many opt for Pandora instead which offers a lean back experience of quality music discovery without much effort. But neither is perfect. Ultimately, the best music service will offer both radio and a la carte. And that’s why Spotify launched Radio. Netflix offers a similar value proposition with their recommendation algo and their search functionality for video. Unbundling shifts the burden of choice from a select few, to the masses, and in so doing, grows the time allocated to the decision exponentially. This isn’t the best outcome. Instead, consumers prefer a hybrid. Curated most of the time, a la carte by exception.

Last week I wrote about the importance of a financial plan for startups at every stage. It’s a challenge to balance the predictability the board requests and the ambition the company wants. Often, as startups grow, they adopt two plans: a board plan and a company plan. By creating two plans and presenting each to the right audience, founders can communicate and motivate their teams effectively. The board plan is the more conservative of the two. Typically, the founding/management team has a high degree of confidence in the board plan, something like 90% confidence. The board plan’s audience is the board. It’s often viewed as the commitment the management team makes to the board, so it can be used as a framework for evaluating the team’s performance at quarter or year end. The company plan is the stretch plan, a 70% confidence plan. The company plan is often a roll up of the goals or OKRs (objective and key results) of each individual team. The company plan is the aggregation of the commitment teams within the company. It’s useful as a framework for evaluating employees. In practice, having two plans instead of one or none at all may seem like an additional complication. But there is a tremendous benefit - these two plans set the right expectations for each audience and enable the company to build predictability into the business while still setting ambitious goals. The alternative, having only one plan that contains the stretch goals for employees and is also presented to the board, is a recipe for stress. In one scenario, the company is consistently missing plan because the stretch goals are presented as high probability. In another, the company is “sandbagging” - aiming to achieve only very realistic goals and not reaching high enough. Managing expectations only increases in importance as companies become larger. Some publicly traded companies, like Apple, have three plans: the “street” plan, the board plan and the company plan. The street plan has about 99% confidence because investors are the most sensitive to missed expectations. Setting the right expectations for the right audience can be a powerful management tool for founders. NB: thanks to Justin Yoshimura who wrote me an email inspiring this post

Over lunch last week, I asked a Redpoint entrepreneur, who had recently sold his company, how his board could have been more helpful to him. His answer surprised me. He wished the company had built a financial/operational plan sooner. Building an financial plan is challenging and it is often perceived as a waste of time because the plan can be so inaccurate. Lots of entrepreneurs tell me their plans are just WAGs - wild assed guesses. And to some degree they are. But, in the words of this entrepreneur, financial planning helped him sleep better at night - even if the plan was a guess. When I asked him why he felt better with a plan in place he outlined three reasons: Reverse engineer the next round - For most of the life of a startup, the company is targeting a subsequent round of financing and working towards a milestone to underpin the financing. A financial plan helps to determine whether or not the milestones are achievable with the cash in the bank. Degrees of freedom - Can we hire another engineer? What if we spent $15k on this conference? What is the impact of hiring a VP of Sales? How does this accelerate our out-of-cash date? Does this accelerate our path to the milestone? A financial model helps explore different scenarios - the degrees of freedom a startup has to achieve milestones. All the arrows point in the same direction - The financial plan is a concise summary of the way a company is likely to be managed. It’s helpful for the board to help validate the plan compared to other startups' plans. The plan is also a great way to level set the management team on the plan for the business. The financial plan may never be accurate. But the accuracy of the plan isn’t the point - instead, the plan is a tool to communicate, explore scenarios and successfully manage the company to the next big milestone.

When building a freemium SaaS company or an ecommerce company or any product that requires users to move through a funnel towards an objective, it’s important to track this funnel to understand where the funnel can be improved. But tracking one funnel may not be enough. The aggregated funnel may be masking conversion differences across customers segments. For example, at Expensify conversion rates to paid vary quite a bit across customer size. But the total conversion-to-paid rate hides these nuances. It’s critical to understand each segment well.  For each, which features are missing or are too complex? How do they prefer to try and pay for the product? Which acquisition mechanic is the most effective? What marketing message resonates with the segment? This understanding is ultimately critical to the success of the product and marketing teams who must determine how to serve the different segments of the customer base effectively and efficiently. It’s also another example of why founders should teach their teams statistics . We recently built a segmented marketing funnel at Expensify. These are the steps we followed. Identify your segments. This can be done through intuition, customer interviews, or data science. I used company size as the first pass segmentation for Expensify, but I intend to explore clustering to see if there are more nuanced segments. Define the key steps in the funnel: registration, activation, contact and purchase might be an example. Define other related metrics: the fraction of users that must be upsold through online channels vs inside sales, the average value per customer, the current penetration of the account vs the total possible value of the account. Run the analysis and see what results come about. If no insights are present, or the data is relatively homogeneous, it might be worth redefining the segments. Structure the marketing, product and sales team goals around funnel performance. Optimize the funnels.

Great products are like ducks. They are calm above the water but paddling furiously below the water. An entrepreneur told me this quip last week and I think it had great wisdom in it. In other words great products are graceful. They make something complex look effortless. Great athletes are the same. So are great dancers. And even great entrepreneurs. The secret within this aphorism is that success is a grind. It is hard work. It’s easier to let it all hang out for others to see how hard work can be. Often we want others to understand how challenging a problem was to solve or how stressful a deal was to close or how complex a product is. But the people and products who capture our imaginations are the ones who grind like everyone else but remain placid on the surface. These are the graceful ones - the ducks. They make the grind disappear and the results of their work seem effortless as a result.

Vinod Khosla penned a great overview of the three phases of a company this weekend. He identifies the hub and spoke phase, the organized chaos phase, the functional management phase. Once a founder has experienced each of these phases, it’s easy to identify the them in retrospect. But companies don’t transition from one phase to another in discrete steps. Instead, they morph and evolve fluidly into these phases. Throughout this metamorphosis, two things must remain constant to keep the startup functional: the vision/mission of the company and the culture of the company. Lacking a consistent vision, the startup can enter a tailspin - with a team unclear on the path to pursue. Without the right culture, teams fall apart. Both of these are responsibilities are those of the founders. Founders are the stewards of vision and culture. And that’s why they are vital to the success of the company at every stage.

Yesterday’s post on distribution partnerships for startups elicited a few comments and questions about other important elements startups should consider when contemplating partnerships. I’ve listed a few other major partnership elements below. Qualifying the Partnership Quality of inbound traffic - As part of measuring the cost/benefit of a partnership, it’s critical to understand quality of traffic/customers from a distribution partnership, as @jamesreinhart pointed out. Ideally, a startup should collect data on the performance of a distribution channel before entering into a long-term agreement with a partner. Conversion rates can vary widely by channel and lots of poor traffic isn’t worth the effort. Setting the Partnership on a Path to Succeed Internal dynamics play a huge role in the success of a partnership. With large scale or long term partnerships, an internal champion whose job is on the line is essential for the success of the partnership. Additionally, it’s critical to understand your potential partner’s motivations for working together and structuring the deal so that both parties are motivated to cooperate - and that incentives don’t diverge with time. Is this a check-the-box partnership or is this a strategic priority for your partner? Spifs or sales incentives If you are considering a distribution or sales channel partnership, spiffs or sales promotion incentive funds ensure that sales teams working for your partner are paid to sell your product. Without spifs, salespeople aren’t going to push your products because they make no extra money. Ideally, your partner bankrolls the spifs. Or the costs are deducted from their portion of the revenue share. Marketing commitment is a critical focal point for distribution partnerships. Successful partnerships often have marketing performance metrics in the contract. This can be as high level as a dedicated marketing budget or as low level as guarantees on the number of customers/leads. Without any of these terms, the partnership has the potential to flounder in obscurity. Deal Terms Remuneration - If the partnership requires engineering or additional service level agreements, an up-front NRE (non-recurring engineering) fee from your partner is a common way to finance this work. Ideally, a startup uses this NRE to finance and accelerate development on the product roadmap. NRE payments have seduced startups in the past (including one I worked for). Pursuing NRE as cash-flow at the expense of its roadmap, transforms the startup into a consultancy - not the best outcome. Other forms of remuneration include revenue share - the split between the parties. And of course revenue guarantees. Guarantees tend to misalign incentives for partners. Whoever is guaranteed revenue can just put their feet up while the partner works hard to make money. Avoid them. Exclusivity is generally a very bad thing. Large companies try to enforce exclusivity to prevent their competition from working with a startup. Obviously, such an overbearing constraint limits the size of a startup’s market. There are several effective strategies to negotiate against exclusivity: (1) offering exclusivity for a short period of a few months; (2) limiting the breadth of the exclusivity by explicit naming of competitors that startup cannot partner with; (3) framing the benefits of working with multiple partners as a benefit through shared data, shared product features or some other mutual benefit; (4) framing the startup’s success as critical to the health of the partnership. Strategic investments - Sometimes partners like to invest into a startup as part of a partnership. They would like to participate in the upside of the success they engender. The cash infusion is alluring for the startup and typically strategic investments occur at better terms than those of the venture market. Strategic investments may grant a partner information rights - detailed knowledge typically shared only with the board. Knowing much about a startup provides the partner an effective right-of-first-refusal to purchase the company. Should an acquisition offer arrive from a third party, your partner will be made aware. This skews the dynamics of an M&A process to the detriment of the startup. First, the partner will have had extensive access to the company and its assets, which means the partner can price the company better than any third party. A third party would have to be foolish to pay more than the partner. Second, the partner will be made aware of incoming M&A interest and has an effective right-of-first-refusal. They may increase any third party’s bid by 5% and win the deal. Messy dynamics indeed. By and large, I encourage only later stage companies (post-Series B) to consider strategic investments.  At later stages, the valuation a company can command limits the ownership a partner will purchase, limits information rights and rids an M&A process of the effective ROFR dynamic. Breach - Both sides will want a clause that spells out the terms for breaking the partnership. The amount of notice, size of damages, process for restitution and so on should be explicit. Lastly, it’s important to remember very partnership is different. Key points of negotiation vary widely. Having experienced counsel and a strong board is a big help in evaluating partnerships.

When a startup is approached by an established company about partnership, it can be a very exciting time. Sometimes partnerships change the trajectory of a startup. Other times, the weight of partnerships can crush startups. Servicing a much larger partner’s needs with a small team can be a full time job and deprive the startup of any time to advance their independent projects. When evaluating a partnership, the most important first-pass analysis to conduct is to understand whether in the success scenario, the partnership is worth the effort by comparing the startup’s progress to a conservative estimate of internal growth. Distribution Partnership Example Below is a chart for a fast growing startup. The blue area measures the userbase which starts at 50,000 users on month zero and grows 15% each month. Suppose on month one, the startup signs a distribution partnership agreement that guarantees the startup 10,000 users per month for 2 years. But it takes 9 months to complete integration work, set up the marketing campaign and so on. At the outset, 10,000 users per month is a big deal -  an additional third of the user base. But a year later, the partnership is driving only 7% of new users. As a fraction of all users, the partnership has driven 14% of all users. And the value of the partnership decreases with time. Net-net Upside Was the 9 months of integration work worth the effort? One way to answer this question is to estimate what additional features or marketing initiatives could have been launched using the time allocated to integration. And their corresponding impact to growth. If our startup could grow 1.5% more per month because we allocated the time to internal initiatives instead of the product, in three years' time the user base would be nearly twice as large - and growth remains under the startup’s control. Skate to where the puck will be The decision to pursue a partnership is complicated. There are considerations of the increase to brand value, access to new potentially more lucrative customer bases, access to new forms of technology, and many other potential advantages. But a good first pass filter is comparing the success scenario to a reasonable estimate of exclusive internal growth.

This morning NPR profiled an education researcher comparing and contrasting the way different cultures approach intelligence and learning in schools. Though the debate about education methodologies is fascinating, I found the one of the stories in the report reminded me of the importance of transparent cultures in startups. In 1979, Jim Stigler, a researcher from UMich went to study education in Japan. Sitting in the back of a fourth grade math class, he watched as the teacher asked the class to draw cubes. The teacher selected the student who was having the greatest difficulty drawing the cube to go to the blackboard and struggle in front of the class as his classmates critiqued his work periodically. As the student tried again and again to draw a cube, Jim grew anxious - as many of us might. By the end of the class, the the student drew a cube properly and stood in front of the classroom with great pride. His classmates applauded him. I admire startup cultures that prioritize transparency and reward struggle because these companies value learning. Very few companies have direct and unwavering paths to market. Most of them have to bob and weave, pivot and rebuild. The team that can identify their challenges, test their assumptions, understand the problems and respond the fastest will ultimately be the team which wins the market. The first component to such a company is a culture of honest and straightforward feedback. The second component is a team which is willing to support each other through their each respective struggles to learn how best to serve the company. Every startup will struggle. Building a transparent and honest environment is the key to transforming struggle into progress - like drawing a cube on blackboard with classmates watching.

Yesterday, I watched as a friend of mine created an Expensify account for his startup. He was trying the product for the first time. I took notes without saying much. The experience reminded me of the hours I spent in Google’s usability labs watching people use our AdSense Demographic Targeting beta product. In those sessions, I remember feeling a sense of excitement followed by frustration - even disillusionment. Often, the product confused users. And I had only one person to blame: myself. The Three Customer Types It was challenging to meet the needs of three user segments in our user base: new users, occasional users and power users. New users need to be educated to use the product in their first visit, in a straightforward way, without being educated. Instead, it should feel like an invitation - an enticement. Occasional users may return to the product infrequently. They remember certain functions but forget others. Sometimes, they needed to be reminded or assisted. Power users want to maximize productivity, minimize time and use a much broader set of functionality. Progressive UIs We tried building an AdWords UI that would progressively reveal features as the customer evolved, showing more sophisticated features over time. After all, AdWords is a tremendously deep product offering all sorts of targeting, budgeting and other options. But maintaining separate UIs for different customer segments is a luxury only very profitable companies can afford. And one whose tepid success ultimately questioned the worthiness of the endeavor. A more elegant solution Instead of treating each of these groups differently, we can view these three groups as just one segment. Ultimately, each of these user segments wants the same thing: to move the application quickly and achieve a goal. They want the product to perform the way they expect and react thoughtlessly. They expect features to be logically grouped and located. They want the product to focus them - not distract them. Great products are like forks. It’s hard to tell where your hand stops and the fork begins. In the same way you can look at a fork and deduce its use, great products don’t need training manuals or video guides, because they are intuitive. Looking at your product for the first time, every time This became my mantra: look at my product for the first time, every time. It meant spending a lot of time in the usability lab. But it was a simplifying assumption that helped solve the problem for the three user segments. The core features had to be simple and straightforward. The power user features needed to be in places power users expected them to be. I’m not sure any product I built ever lived up to these aspirations, but I do believe they were the right goals.

In a triumph of statistics, Nate Silver predicted the outcome of every state in the Presidential election correctly. What makes this story so noteworthy isn’t that it proves data enables superior decision-making to human intuition. We know the math works. Instead, Silver’s success highlights and challenges the prevailing culture, present in politics and in the workplace, that overvalues intuition and undervalues data. Our analysis tools and our access to big data are forcing cultural change at the broadest scale. The latest field to face this upheaval is journalism. It won’t be the last. Data is the most cogent argument. Because we compare Silver’s predictions to the outcome, we can understand his thought process and his logic. It’s black and white. Right or wrong. And if it’s wrong, we can fix the models. Political parties, journalists, and startups that build cultures that use data to make dispassionate arguments and objectively measure performance will be the ones that will seemingly pull a rabbit out of a hat - just like Silver. And these performances will become increasingly consistent. Who won’t pay attention to Silver’s data in four years' time? We’re going to continue to hear about these rabbits with increasing frequency - whether it’s Nate Silver, Moneyball, the story of Oakland As, the high frequency traders on Wall Street, the search algorithms of Google, or the data science teams of LinkedIn. These events will be more common because these companies aren’t using sleight of hand to pull these rabbits. They use linear regression.

Must content platforms be reinvented every few years? Left to its own devices, the mob will augment, accessorize, spam, degrade and noisify whatever they have access to, until it loses beauty and function and becomes something else. Seth Godin Given the noise and misinformation disseminated on Twitter both during the election and the Sandy disaster , I’ve been wondering how Godin’s thoughts apply to new information networks: blogs and feeds. Sifting the feed in search of the truth There is an undeniable early movement toward editorially curated publishing. The Twitter founders have launched the most visible response. Medium , a low volume, high quality content site is a direct (and opposite) reaction to the high volume, noisy Twitter feed. Content proliferation is governed by its half-life In addition to volume reduction, Medium axes another dimension: time. Medium places no dates on its posts. Instead, Medium uses a voting system to judge and display the quality of a particular post. Blogging has used time as the primary dimension for relevance. The posts a visitor should read are the most recent - so the assumption goes. Feeds are no different. In fact, time is the most prevalent quality metric in social products but it shouldn’t be because much of the best content on the web is evergreen. Content’s half-life is the amount of time required for content to reach half of its lifetime viewership. Relying on time as a proxy for quality accelerates this half-life. The decrease in content’s lifespan makes writing long-form content less worthwhile despite it’s much greater intrinsic value. After all, longer content typically has deeper thought at its root. Jump on the bandwagon Medium is not alone. Svbtle , the platform I write for, is also fostering curated blogging. Arguably, Quora led this trend by focusing on questions. Branch is surfacing debates. Marco Arment’s The Magazine is yet another example . If these efforts succeed, I think we will build the internet into a much better library - a library not made of scraps of paper but of deep and lasting thought - new Alexandria. Queen said it best: So don’t become some background noise A backdrop for the girls and boys Who just don’t know or just don’t care And just complain when you’re not there You had your time, you had the power You’ve yet to have your finest hour Radio - radio All we hear is radio ga ga Radio goo goo Radio ga ga

This morning, I listened to an interview of Jon Gertner who has published a chronicle of Bell Labs called the Idea Factory . In his book and the interview, Gertner highlighted points about the Bell Labs that relate to Clay Christensen’s recent New York Times editorial, the Capitalist’s Dilemma. Bell Labs was a house of magic - a place of prodigious invention and innovation. In a single year, Bell scientists and engineers developed the transistor, satellite communication and information theory (the theory that underpins all digital technologies). The advances pioneered by Bell have created 100 years of massive economic growth: the Internet, digital communication, semiconductors for the US. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_208_738029080" style="padding-left: 100px;"> In the Capitalist’s Dilemma, Christensen divides innovations into three types: empowering innovations (the transistor, the engine, fiberoptics) which create new markets, industries and jobs; sustaining innovations (hybrid cars, electric toothbrushes) which replace existing products with marginally better ones; and efficiency innovations (minimills and GEICO, SaaS) which reduce the market size and jobs through automation or other efficiency gains. Christensen laments that American innovation has transitioned from empowering innovations to sustaining innovations to efficiency innovations - hollowing the job market. But I think it’s too narrow a view. Monopoly drove innovation at Bell Bell Labs was able to focus on long-term empowering innovations for one reason: they were a government sanctioned vertically and horizontally integrated monopoly that benefited from massive guaranteed cash flows for decades. Bell controlled 90% of the telephone lines and service in the US. They would count on the subscription revenue growing as the market grew and without much competition, none of their customers would churn. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_208_770700978" width="500px"> Because of the predictability of their revenue, they could afford to take a very long term view of product development and invest $50M into a project that wouldn’t succeed. Or invest $100M in a 15 year project to upgrade all mechanical switches in the telephone infrastructure to electric ones. Their enormous balance sheet enabled them to undertake the large risks that are essential to building empowering innovations. In addition, researchers at Bell Labs moved freely between academia, government and the labs. Because of the cross-pollination of research across disciplines, they were able to advance very quickly. Startup balance sheets limit empowering innovations Christensen argues we’re pursuing the wrong kind of innovation because of system challenges. Startups lack the cash to afford long term technology development. Sometimes startups build empowering innovations by commercializing research from universities - OpenFlow networking is powering companies like BigSwitch. Other times venture investors may invest ten or twenty million for technology developments at great risk. But this happens too infrequently and at too great a risk to the investor. It’s the same argument that no startups are working on hard problems anymore. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_208_152989178" width="500px"> Other times big companies with huge balance sheets produce these empowering innovations like Yahoo/Google with MapReduce or Google’s Fiber initiative. These are more reminiscent of the Bell Labs innovation. But these are scant in number. Sometimes the government gets involved like they have with solar power and electric cars. The great hope is the circle completing itself In my view, the the most exciting possibility of large scale and real empowering innovation creation isn’t any of these because they all drive only very small volumes of innovation. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_208_750110834" width="500px"> Instead, my hope is that the efficiency innovations allow new startups to create empowering innovations. Faster processors and server management tools (sustaining and efficiency innovation) enabled cloud computing, an empowering innovation. This cycle drives the valley and the economy forward. To despair that we aren’t building important or truly disruptive innovations is to have a very short term view of innovation. Every step forward is a step forward. Some are bigger, some are smaller. Sometimes these steps occur within monoliths and sometimes they occur within startups. Sometimes they occur three in the same year, sometimes it takes thirty years to make a breakthrough. The most important thing is that the ecosystem (government, education, private enterprise, capital) continues to foster innovation. The rest will take care of itself.

In May 2010, I bet a good friend of mine that Android would overtake iOS in total devices shipments in 12 months' time. My prediction was completely off the mark. In May 2011, iOS led cumulative shipments by more than 100%: 191M to 95M. It would take another 10 months for Android to equal Apple in March 2011 at about 325M each. Race to one billion devices ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/"> But Android reached this milestone in a way I didn’t anticipate. I expected a clean division between the high and low ends of the market along OS lines. Apple starts up-market and discounts for the down-market ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_209_666409879" width="500px") Surprisingly, Android has been competing successfully at the high end. The Samsung Galaxy line has sold tens of millions of units . So have the Motorola Droid phones which have similar price points to the iPhone. And Apple has been discounting older models of their devices to to win the low end of the market.  In fact, Apple has a mobile product at every $50 price point between $0 and $850. The lion’s share of profits As Android wins the market share war, commanding 75% market share of devices, Apple reaps 71% of mobile hardware profits. And those margins are increasing as the company drives leverages economies of scale . Android’s lead will continue to grow Despite this pricing strategy, Android has surpassed iOS in devices - a change that will likely never be reversed because Android activations continue to grow at a faster monthly growth rate than iOS, even as Android’s device activation count increases. Potential for huge growth in Android tablets despite slow start Tablets are a key growth factor for Android - a form factor I worried would be a challenge for the OS . 40% of Apple’s mobile devices activated in Q3 were tablets. Should this ratio hold for Android, then there could be a 4x upside in Android tablet shipments. A battle on many fronts The end result is the same as many forecasted: Android has become the market share leader and Apple has won the lion’s share of profits. But the path has been much more nuanced than I expected.

There’s a Pixar movie that captures the ethos of Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurship culture which it summarizes this way: While not everyone can be a great chef, a great chef can come from anywhere The magic of the valley is that there is no path, no formula, no stencil for how to be successful. There is no university one must attend, no incubator one must join, no technology one must master to be successful. Every entrepreneur has a different route to their successes. But I do think there is one common element among entrepreneurs: an open mind - a mind receptive to new ideas, new people, new disruptions, new pivots and new ways of challenging commonly assumed precepts. Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki said it best in his book Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind: If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything, it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s mind there are few. Anyone can have an open mind, a beginner’s mind - so a great entrepreneur can come from anywhere.

Ariel Diaz wrote an insightful post in PandoDaily yesterday outlining the state of affairs in online education. Ariel touched on the history of education, catalogued the problems of the status quo and pointed to a few innovative initiatives. Most Edu Innovation is Post-Secondary Reading the post and reflecting on the startups I’ve seen, I concluded most of the innovation in education has occurred in post-secondary education instead of K-12, despite the fact that the K-12 market is about 50% larger in dollar terms than the post-secondary market . For example, massively open online courses (MOOCs) like EdX and CourseEra target university students. The major for-profit education companies, Capella and Phoenix, serve university students. 2Tor/2U brings online education to offline colleges. And so on. But the same innovations aren’t present in K-12. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_211_879900723" width="500px"> The Two Limiting Factors for the K-12 Market Why is this? I think there are two limiting factors for serving the K-12 market. First, there is a perception challenge. Any business that is too successful serving this market will be lashed by the public. “You’re making 30% EBIDTA margins on the backs of sixth-graders?!” It just doesn’t sit well with parents or tax-payers. Ultimately, this reaction becomes a public policy issue - but again it’s just a perception issue. Second is a more tangible and addressable problem: it’s hard to sell to K-12 Small purchasing decisions for software are delegated to each of 14,000 school districts . Depending on the regulations of the state, every principal has the authority to authorize purchases under $25k unilaterally, so I’m told. This discretionary market totals $350M, but imposes significant costs of direct sales to principals. Anything greater requires budget approval, RFP processes and immensely long sales cycles driven by committee approval - aka government sales. And startups can’t afford to compete and wait for these decisions to be made. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_211_939750560" width="500px"> K-12 Distribution Hacks As a result, startups serving the K-12 market hope to reach teachers and students through consumer marketing channels like the web and mobile applications, circumventing the traditional sales process. This is called the consumerization of education - a parallel to the consumerization of the enterprise. EdModo has demonstrated great success aggregating 10M users or thereabouts in this fashion. Perhaps they will serve as a conduit for other startups. Recently, another channel has been created in NYC through a program called InnovateNYC. Steven Hodas formerly of the Princeton Review and Contnu a continuing learning company is helping edtech startups navigate the the NYC Department of Education. It’s an encouraging sign that large school districts are looking for innovation, enabling startups to reach their target customers, establish fit, all while skirting the monolithic RFP processes. Won’t somebody please think of the children? I hope programs like InnovateNYC spread and I wish distribution channels like EdModo enable startups to reach, empower and educate students in K-12. They could make a world of difference.

Peter Senge has been called the most influential business strategists of the century and in my view Senge is the successor of Peter Drucker, the management visionary. Senge published a book in 1990 called The Fifth Discipline which I think every manager, founder and CEO should read. Great companies transcend their great products. Not defined by one product, these companies adapt, innovate and reinvent. They learn continuously to succeed as their environment changes. Senge’s book teases apart the five essential components to building a learning organization. At the time the book was published, the first four principles had been well covered: team learning, shared vision, mental models, and personal skills mastery. But the fifth one, the one the book is named after, was Senge’s stroke of genius. The fifth discipline is systems thinking. Systems thinking sounds like an esoteric concept but it’s not. Systems thinking means understanding actions/reactions and feedback loops for a company. In other words, how the actions of a company or features of a product change consumer behavior. Infed has a good description of the idea with a concrete example: ‘[In every company] whatever movement occurs is amplified, producing more movement in the same direction. A small action snowballs, with more and more and still more of the same, resembling compound interest’ (Senge 1990: 81). Thus, we may cut our advertising budgets, see the benefits in terms of cost savings, and in turn further trim spending in this area. In the short run there may be little impact on people’s demands for our goods and services, but longer term the decline in visibility may have severe penalties. An appreciation of systems will lead to recognition of the use of, and problems with, such reinforcing feedback, and also an understanding of the place of balancing (or stabilizing) feedback. Peter Senge These feedback loops are ubiquitous in web software. And they are found in the most importantgg

The Verge profiled Google Now, Google’s newest search technology which uses “predictive” queries to show users the information they want to see, before users ask. In a single app, the company has combined its latest technologies: voice search that understands speech like a human brain, knowledge of real-world entities, a (somewhat creepy) understanding of who and where you are, and most of all its expertise at ranking information. Google has taken all of that and turned it into an interesting and sometimes useful feature, but if you look closely you can see that it’s more than just a feature, it’s a beta test for the future. It’s quite a bold statement to make, but I think it’s accurate. I believe Google Now will become the most salient differentiator of Android devices compared to other operating systems in the next 24 months. The product leverages Google’s investments in machine learning across all the disciplines above and carves a huge moat between Android and iOS (and Windows). I think Apple will continue to differentiate iOS using hardware design. Windows is leveraging its OS design differences. And Google will use search. In the video below, Hugo Barra, the head of product for Google Now, asks for “directions to the museum with the William Paley exhibit” and Google Now returns navigation instructions to the De Young Museum, reacting just like a person might. Examples of human-computer interaction like this one truly seem to be magic because they dissolve the barrier in communication between the two. You can watch the 15 minute video here:

Over the last six months, I’ve been delving deeply into R, linear regressions and machine learning. Part of the rationale has been to remember some of the concepts I learned in grad school studying signal processing. But a more important driver has been the need to better understand how to qualify, evaluate and hire data scientists because data science is a massive competitive advantage . And many of the companies I work with are hiring data scientists. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_214_461612228">Support Vector Machine Visualized Finding the right person to model your data and generate insights can provide massive leverage for your company. But understanding what to look for in a candidate is a challenge. In my view, when hiring a data scientist, one should look for three main skills with a bonus fourth: data processing, data analysis, data modeling, and system architecture. Data processing Perhaps the most undervalued skill, data processing is the ability to transform data from its current form into a form that can be analyzed. Often data scientists have to extract data from many different internal databases, meaning a knowledge of SQL is important. Also, scraping data from the web or from pdfs is quite common so mastery of scripting is essential. Last, a basic knowledge of Unix to access databases through command line and through secure channels is important. Data analysis After data is processed, it must be analyzed. Data analysis is the application of statistics to data to understand what the data imply. Almost anyone can use Excel to build a summary analysis of averages and medians. But without a good grasp of statistical significance, the distributions underlying the data and data bias (like survivorship bias ), statistics and data can lead companies to the wrong decisions. So a strong data scientist needs to understand the theories of statistics including the central limit theorem, the different types of distributions, statistical significance testing and so on. Data modeling Last, data is modeled. Data science becomes a weapon when the vast amounts of data a company collects can be used to predict or inform business decisions, for example prioritizing a sales funnel or determining what to pay for an ad impression in real time. This is data modeling / machine learning. There are many machine learning methods: neural networks, support vector machines, linear regression, regression trees, k-nearest neighbors. And the application of these methods isn’t challenging. But implementing them is only the first 20% of the work. The rest, the 80%,  is tuning the models to make them perform. Fire up R and type lm() or rpart() and you have a linear model or a regression tree. The odds are that the data fed into the model won’t be the right one the first time. And that the data will need to be cleaned or transformed. Many different models will need to be run, compared and contrasted, until one that has a strong enough prediction capability is found. Experience tuning models is essential. System architecture The bonus skill is system architecture. Ultimately, machine learning systems may be deployed into production environments - like Netflix’s recommendation algorithm. Data scientists who understand how to integrate their infrastructure into the existing web stack without impacting performance or creating excessive dependencies are tremendous assets to the company. Modeling data scientists Now the challenge for me is building a model to tell me where to find these great data scientists. If you find someone who can do that, send them my way.

Last week, a close friend, who is a product manager/designer, told me he’s starting a company. He asked me where I thought the biggest opportunity lay given his skills and his passions. He’s incredibly capable and driven, but he hasn’t yet found the right place to apply his energy.  My friend is in search of a problem to solve. He’s in the right place. After all: “The essence of a startup lies in the process of discovering a problem shared by many people and trying to solve it.” . So how does a founder discover these problems? Research. I suggested to him that he should pretend to be a sociologist, study the way that employees of medium sized companies work. Which software they use, which processes they perform, how they collaborate. Most people love to share their gripes, frustrations and pains with a receptive listener. Aggregating this feedback over a set of interviews will provide him (i) some insight into common pain points across positions, rank and company (ii) an idea of which problems excite him (iii) and generate new ideas for his startup. In short, these interviews help him collect, define and narrow the problem he’s most excited about solving. (Also, this research will help him understand his target market]( http://tomasztunguz.com/2012/05/15/how-to-pick-your-startups-market/ ). Of course in his research, he may discover a secret or an angle, a proprietary insight that would catapult his startup into the market. But the only way to find this secret is to get into the field and start researching.

When I walk into a bank today, I might deposit my cash in exchange for some interest rate. The interest rate is my cut of the profits the bank made on my deposit through their trading and lending activities. The more assets under management, the more money a bank can make on its own account. Like banks, web companies are in the business of maximizing gigabytes of user data under management. When I use Google products like Gmail, Google Search, Android and Android applications, Google Chrome for browsing, Google Plus for social networking, Google TV, YouTube, clicking on Google Ads, I’m “depositing” my data with Google. Google uses this panoply of data across their user base to generate tens of billions in revenue from advertising at 30% EBITDA margins. The profits of the advertising business subsidize all of their free products I mentioned above. Said in the reverse, all these free products attract users to deposit data with Google. Data is the linchpin of Google’s revenue models . And because the marginal cost of storing user data is negligible and the marginal benefit of additional data is substantial, (more data means better ad targeting which means more profit), Google benefits from tremendous economies of scale. The same is true for Facebook, Yahoo, Aol, Demand Media, WebMD and every other consumer service. But, the concept of maximizing gigabytes under management doesn’t stop at advertising businesses. In fact, it’s fundamental to many categories of internet companies. Freemium companies like Expensify and Zendesk subsidize product use in exchange for user data to inform inside sales teams' funnels. Social networks like LinkedIn and PatientsLikeMe operate social networks in exchange for user data, selling subscriptions for data access. Amazon operates Prime (a “free” shipping service and a “free” video-on-demand service) at what must be negative operating margin to drive more browsing, for more data, to improve targeting and increase sales. The most successful companies on the internet create a reinforcing cycle in with this idea: they use free products to acquire more gigabytes under management to drive more profits which are used to build better free products. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

I met the Electric Imp team in April. I had bumped into one of their engineers at a party and he pinged me a few weeks later to say he was working for a startup and the company was raising. The company came in to the office on a Monday at noon. Hugo, the founder, Electric Imp demoed their product to me. Ten minutes in, I stopped the pitch meeting, pulled 3 partners from their Monday partner meeting, and issued a term sheet that afternoon. The demo was just that compelling. Electric Imp’s demo had three key parts: A simple and clear story line, that the audience related to, describing how a user might use their product to solve a problem and improve their lives. A beautiful product that inspires.  Though the software was raw, the hardware and software worked together flawlessly and everyone in the room had a clear picture of the way the technology could change the world. Well practiced delivery. Smooth, crisp and clear. Clearly, this process is an exception. But great demos close customers, investors and candidates because they sell the dream. Invest in your demo - they embody the vision, passion and aspiration of the company.

Examining a user’s motivations at the entry point of every major feature in a product and matching the product to this motivation is key to building a great product users love. BJ Fogg’s Behavior Model Theory is a succinct summary of this idea in a formula: Motivation + Trigger + Ability = Behavior This model says that a user will perform a behavior when given the means, the motive, and the opportunity. The user brings motivation, but it’s the responsibility of the product to trigger a behavior and offer an intuitive experience to complete it. Users' motivation varies. In ecommerce, sometimes users are very motivated: I need to buy a last minute gift for my wedding anniversary. Sometimes users are lackadaisical: I’m just browsing. But, the most effective products match a user’s changing motivation to the friction of the task. For example, Amazon asks customers to fill out credit card information only after after adding items to a shopping cart. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_218_84474409" width="500px"> It’s one thing to do this in a single user flow like purchasing. But the very best products chain these behaviors together. They intake user motivation, trigger and entice a user to perform behaviors over and over again deepening the user’s ability to use the product and driving engagement. Facebook is a great example. First, Facebook asks you to create a profile of yourself online, using vanity as a motivator. Then they ask you to visit the profile of your friends, using curiosity as a motivator. Next they ask you to connect to your friends to increase your perceived popularity, again using vanity. And so on with photos, groups, and applications. Integrating this philosophy into product development is a challenge, but the results will speak for themselves.

It’s tempting to burrow within a garage or basement or apartment to develop a product for several months and emerge from the darkness with a new shiny product. But the launch will likely fall flat. Products must be launched into ecosystems, in particular, into receptive ecosystems. In my view, there are three types of ecosystems that startups should cultivate. These ecosystems provide distribution leverage - that’s what makes them so powerful and so essential at the start of a company. 1. Customer/User Community Users provide product feedback, build word of mouth distribution, write reviews, become reference customers and form the basis of online support communities. Often, these communities are worth their weight in gold . 2. Platforms The most platforms are app stores (iOS, Android and Facebook) which provide access to hundreds of millions of users. But relationship with these platforms don’t start and stop at the developer terms of service. The most effective startups build relationships with the managers of these platforms to understand how to align goals of the startup and the platform. 3. The Press The press is a great way of focusing attention on a startup for a short period of time. Building an ongoing relationship with the press provides a startup with a megaphone at key times during the company’s life to trumpet success, drive awareness and build the brand. Launching a product with the support of these ecosystems can provide orders of magnitude better leverage. Building these relationships isn’t easy, but the investment can pay off in spades. Examples from the Redpoint portfolio: User Ecosystem ThredUp’s Facebook page where thousands of moms congregate Expensify’s iTunes page with hundreds of customers reviews ZenDesk’s reference customer page Platforms Heroku’s add on Store StorSimple’s distribution through Microsoft

Every social service aims to achieve massive growth and deep engagement.  But if forced to choose just one of these attributes, I would pick engagement every time. An active user base implies product/user fit for a social service. Aside from the core functionality of social services, which is a solved problem (profiles, messaging, feed), the essence of a social startup is culture - the values of the community, the mores, the manners of interaction. The right culture attracts users, encourages participation and drives growth. For proof, look at Reddit’s growth to 2B page views and the clear values they promote for their community. The same is true for Pinterest. Did you know Pinterest has Pin Etiquette ? Successful online cultures replicate the behaviors of offline groups (from political groups to book clubs) which communicate a clear purpose for organizing members, defined norms for interacting, and effective tools for solving their members' needs and wants. So how does a social service become massive? The key is focusing on culture to drive engagement at the very beginning. I’ve drawn my take on the path using this engagement/growth 2x2 matrix to describe the path from the Ghost Town to the Rave. 4 - The Ghost Town: low engagement, low growth Obviously, the most challenging (and most common) place to be, startup in this situation can focus either on fast growth (which would lead to the Leaky Bucket) or driving engagement (the Garden Party). 3 - The Leaky Bucket: low engagement, high growth The challenge with focusing on fast growth without engagement is that it doesn’t build or reinforce culture. Users are brand new and don’t know how to contribute to the community. Plus, it’s hard to understand what will improve the product when churning through large volumes of unengaged users. 2 - The Garden Party - High engagement, low growth The culture of the social service has been set, the product meets the needs of a small group of people and the party is “polite”. Now it’s time to garner more users while keeping the same values. 1 - The Rave: high engagement, high growth Lots of people have arrived, they know why they came and what the party is about so they’re having a great time. I believe engagement is the foundation of growth. And because, culture cannot be tacked on, the engagement problem can’t be solved through growth alone. Instead, culture has to be inculcated into a community over time.

The first mobile phones were purchased by corporations and given to employees. Thirty years ago, most people used computers at work but not at home. Most of the innovation flowed from the enterprise into the home. Today, it’s very much the opposite. The big trends in enterprise trace the opposite movement both at the software layer and the device layer: consumerization of IT means using consumer channels to acquire customers and bring your own device (BYOD) means 66% of employees bring their own devices to work . ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_221_306807589" width="500px"> Even in infrastructure, many of the big data technologies driving increases in IT spending like Hadoop and Cassandra were developed by consumer internet companies (Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Amazon, etc). This trend makes a great investment thesis: find all the advances in consumer technologies and bring them into the enterprise. I think this force will be the major driver of innovation for enterprise software for the next while.

Freemium businesses' marketing techniques are immensely powerful. They drive large amounts of users to try a product and convert some small fraction of those to paid, upending the enterprise sales model. In some sense, freemium businesses are real world Monte Carlo simulations.  Because of the large volume of users using the product, freemium businesses can generates gigabytes of interaction data and conversion-to-paid data, which makes these kinds of startups particularly well suited to data science, A/B testing and regression analysis. Over the past week, I’ve been trying this first hand. I’m building a Bayesian model in to predict whether an account will convert to paid for one of the companies I work with.  I hope that ultimately this model will prioritize leads for an inside sales team. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_222_592692678" width="500px"> The process of building this model has forced me to refine my thinking about the metrics we gather, the conversion to paid upgrade process and customer segments. I’m still working on this model but some of the questions I found myself asking: Are we collecting the right data to build a model? How can we supplement data about our users to give them more context for analysis? What kinds of characteristics should indicate a customer will likely upgrade? Can I validate those assumptions in the data? Do we have a good enough trigger to convert to paid system? Do our pricing plans make sense for our user base? Instead of pursuing a product centric analysis of our conversion funnel in which customer feedback and design judgement is considered, this process has forced me to perform a customer centric analysis of the conversion funnel. At the very least, I’ve come away with a better understanding of our customers. But I’m hopeful that this conversion to paid regression will be successful, that revenues grow faster as a result and I can adopt the technique with more startups.

For Fortune 500 companies, patents can be offensive and defensive weapons generating billions of dollars worth of royalty and licensing revenues. …if someone at Apple can dream it up, then we should apply for a patent, because even if we never build it, it’s a defensive tool,” Nancy R. Heinen, Apple’s former general counsel The Patent, as a Sword : But startups shouldn’t approach patents the same way large companies do.  Instead, founders should view patents as downside protection - an asset to be valued during a fire-sale of the business. For startups, patents are specious barriers-to-entry. Unlike large corporate patent owners who wield patents in defense of their businesses, founders can’t afford to enforce patents. Startups simply don’t have the legal budgets to bankroll lengthy legal processes. Vlingo fought Nuance for 3 years in court to defend their patents - only to win a Pyrrhic victory. The legal battle exhausted the company’s assets and Vlingo sold to Nuance a short while later for the value of the patents. File your patent, mention it on a pitch deck slide, and then tuck it in your back pocket as a trump card to play when your startup has amassed the legal war chest to enforce it.

In Silicon Valley, we cherish stories of great struggles, persisting failure, and grind-your-teeth kind of grit that eventually leads to great success. These stories are our collective folklore. Today, I want to highlight one of these stories. Amy Cuddy gave a TED talk on how body language shapes who we are and our career trajectories. Her story is insightful, motivational, and electrifying. First, Amy fascinates with scientific data on how body language impacts our careers. Next, she tells us how to harness this power. Last, she inspires us with her gritty story of faking it until she made it against great odds  - a path every startup founder will find familiar. For anyone struggling, striving to find success, may you find your battle cry in this video.

This week Amazon made public its advertising initiatives. Given the massive trove of invaluable purchasing data Amazon collects, I’m certain Amazon could build a rival to AdSense. But they aren’t. Below is a quote from an interview with Lisa Utzschneider , the head of Amazon Media Group: Q: Can you give us a sense of how important advertising is to Amazon? A: I think the way Jeff [Bezos] would answer that is, if we think about Amazon in two worlds, one world is an Amazon with ads and lower prices. Another world is an Amazon with no ads and higher prices. Which one would we choose? I think nine times out of 10, or 10 times out of 10, we would take Amazon with ads and lower prices. In other words, Amazon doesn’t view advertising as an adjacent business to their eCommerce business. Or even a standalone business. It would be easy for Bezos to juice the single-digit margins of the ecommerce business with the much 30 to 40% margin revenue from the Media Group to appeal to Wall Street and boost the stock price in the short term. Instead, Bezos is staking a much longer term and bigger bet: the Media Group will become a growth engine for the eCommerce business. Amazon will use ads to reduce prices, shifting the supply/demand curve and shipping more products. Customers are happier because the prices on Amazon are the lowest on the web. Advertisers are happy because Amazon sells more of their products and benefit from consumer purchasing data. Meanwhile, someone else’s marketing dollars are fueling Amazon’s business, both eCommerce market share and consumer purchasing data. This cycle reinforces Amazon’s strengths and ultimately dominance. Bezos truly is a master of startup judo . He is leveraging other company’s strengths to grow his own business.

Over the weekend, I analyzed my Twitter performance over the past 4 weeks. I wanted to determine what if any best practices I could tease from the data. Below are my four conclusions: The best time for me to tweet is 9am Pacific. On average, tweets at 9am generate 2.3 times the number of clicks as those in the 8am hour and 3.3 times those of the 12pm (lunch) hour. Below is a chart of number of clicks per tweet by hour of the day: Each retweet is worth about 9 clicks. My median tweet receives 24 clicks and the average tweet receives 36 clicks. So the first retweet drives a 25 to 33% increase in clicks.  Below is a chart of tweets (marked by red dots) plotted by the number of reactions/retweets and clicks. The blue line is the linear trendline. Users with huge follower counts send tweets into the stratosphere. There is a step function apparent in the data. If one of my tweets is retweeted by @hnshah with 80k followers, I instantly receive twice the clicks. The chart below plots the reach of each tweet by the number of clicks. The ideal tweet, the one generating the most clicks, is between 40 to 70 characters long and sent between 8:30 and 9:30am. I use timely.is to programmatically send tweets out at the optimal times of the day. You can see from this analysis that tools like these don’t seem to provide much value aside from scheduling. Below is a chart of tweets by time of day (y-axis) and tweet length (x-axis) with the number of clicks indicated by the size of the bubble. My most successful tweet generated about 190 clicks. It was sent at 9:21 am and had 46 characters. NB: I don’t send many long tweets, so there is a data bias. Summary stats Below are stats describing my tweets in a bit more detail. The key conclusion is that the upper bound outliers, the really successful tweets, skew averages much higher than medians - this is the viral effect in action. Clicks Reach Retweets Tweet Length Average 37 11,882 2 65 Median 24 3825 1 61

The flurry of media activity in entrepreneurship including the spate of new TV shows like X-Factor for tech and Shark Tank, the refocus of the NYTimes and WSJ on technology, and the number of entrepreneurs on mainstream magazine covers gave me the impression that entrepreneurship is on the rise. While this may be true in pockets like New York or California, entrepreneurship in the US is shrinking - at least according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and a report from the NYTimes: When Job Creation Engines Stop at Just One For decades, new companies have produced most of the country’s job growth. Without start-ups, the country would have had a net increase in jobs in only seven years since 1977. The number of people employed by new businesses peaked in 1999, the height of the tech bubble, and has fallen by 46 percent since then, to 2.5 million in 2011, creating a slow leak in job creation that has proved difficult to plug. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_227_938250563" width="500px"> “There’s this idea that we can somehow rely on entrepreneurship to get us out of the job crisis,” said Scott Shane, an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University. “That’s getting harder and harder, considering there are fewer and fewer of them, and they’re each employing fewer people.” Entrepreneurship is the engine of growth for the US. We should be doing everything we can to cultivate it: relaxing H1B visa laws, providing better access to capital through banks and the SBA, and fostering the communities to support and educate new entrepreneurs.

Everyone is learning statistics because making sense of data is the difference between success and failure. R, the open source statistics language, is about a third as popular as Ruby and growing fast. Statistics are essential because data is ubiquitous and volumes are growing exponentially, even in startups. CEOs measure key company metrics. Engineers measure application performance and build machine learning models. Marketers measure campaign performance and reach. PMs measure engagement. And so on. A basic knowledge of statistics has become essential for most roles in business and for most companies, I think it’s worth sending most employees to a statistics course, because understanding the relationships across data is the determinant of success. More information implies better analysis means better decisions. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_229_372664240" width="500px"> Venture capital is no different. I spend quite a lot of time with R these days. I’ve written about how I use these for business development. Also, I manage portfolio company performance data, publicly available data like trending applications on the app store. And so on. If a relationship business like venture capital can benefit from statistics, imagine the impact to a performance oriented startup. So pick up that stats 101 book, fire up R and leverage your data for your success.

Over the last few months, I’ve been helping a few companies build hiring pipelines to recruit at nearly every experience level and for technical, sales and business development roles. Below are the lessons I’ve learned. Identify your ideal candidate If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will take you there. Narrow your search focus to find the right candidate. The easiest way to start is by building look-alike candidate lists. I start with either a particular person or a list of companies that would provide someone with the right experience for the role. Right tools. Right mentality. Hiring is a daily process. You should treat it like email - something you do every day. Allocate an hour per day to search and contact potential candidates. Allocate up to 50% of your time to interview, reference and close candidates. Get your technology in place. Upgrade to a premium LinkedIn account. Deploy an applicant tracking system. It can be as simple as Google Docs or Streak. Candidate tracking is essential for success both for communication with candidates but also within your team. Nail your pitch Hiring is sales. Be human in introductory emails. Find a way to relate someone or something about the role to the person you’re contacting. It could be a contact in common, shared work experiences, or shared passions. Say something that will intrigue someone to learn just a bit more. The goal of the email is to generate curiosity and land the first meeting. That’s it. Perfect the process Be responsive. Quick email responses. Quick interview scheduling. Quick decisions. Reference strong prospects in parallel. Immediately after the first meeting, I start contacting former colleagues and co-workers to get another data point before the second interview. Sell the dream You started a company. You should be passionate about it and the opportunity to build something worthwhile. During the process, your goal should be to understand the candidates dreams. Sell the candidate by telling them how your dreams converge.

Passion is not something you follow. It’s something that will follow you as you put in the hard work to become valuable to the world. Follow a Career Passion? Let It Follow You In his book “So Good They Can’t Ignore You”, Cal Newport, a college classmate, champions the idea that passion lags work, instead of passion inspiring work. It’s the same philosophy embraced by sushi master Jiro, in the documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi.” Jiro should focusses on mastering a practice, making sushi. Passion is a magical thing - it is inspiration, a contagious motive force for progress and excitement. Some people have it innately. Others discover a calling through their journeys and develop passionate for a cause. Still others require dedication, discipline and perseverance to elicit it, like Jiro. Founders are an adventurous breed. They undertake the substantial risk of starting a company to solving a problem and improving the world in some way. Underpinning each founder’s decision to start a company is passion. Sometimes a founder’s passion is innate, sometimes it is discovered, sometimes it is cultivated. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter how passion comes about. All that matters is that passion is present and growing. That’s what we are all chasing.

Any number of challenges can arise during a startup’s initial years. Some of these changes could be major and may require rethinking strategy. Competitors enter your target market. New products are released into your market which undercut yours. Customer acquisition costs rise dramatically. If faced with these questions, it’s hard to know where to begin or how to structure an analysis to reach an answer. McKinsey uses a 6 step process to frame the process of answering these strategic questions which is profiled in this month’s Harvard Business Review . This framework has helped me many times simplify strategic questions and shift from questioning to analysis to action. Case: A new competitor emerges to compete with a startup Frame the strategic choices as mutually exclusive options. Start with the most apparent options. Either compete directly with a new competitor or change your target market. Generate alternatives. Brainstorm other possibilities that broaden the option set. Partner with the new entrant. Acquire the new entrant. Specify the conditions under which each option is attractive. Competing directly with a competitor makes sense only if our margins are better than our competitors and our cash balance is larger, meaning we can spend more on marketing and customer acquisition. Identify barriers to each option. Our startup may lack the marketing competency to compete. Design and run tests to prove/disprove each of the conditions. Our goal is to quickly determine which options are feasible and realistic. Let’s run some initial marketing tests to gauge our return on investment. Let’s determine how long it would take to find the right marketing person and how much it might cost. Using the data, make a decision. Enumerating the possibilities, identifying key challenges, developing the triggers for pursuing an option and then deriving key data to compare to these triggers builds clarity into the decision making process. By definition strategy is critical to companies. By using an analysis framework like the one above, you can bring clarity and a common language with your board for evaluating and making the right strategic choices.

Yesterday, I spoke at Columbia Business School. We had a conversation about the role of incubators and accelerators (or the moniker of your choice) within the startup ecosystem. Given the volume of first time entrepreneurs and the broad growth of interest in entrepreneurship, I think these programs are invaluable. To entrepreneurs, these programs offer up to seven value propositions, listed in order of importance, as I see it. Education - Examples include General Assembly runs a substantial education program and YCombinator operates Startup School and First Growth’s Venture Network Startup-in-a-box - TechStars offers legal help to incorporate a company, PR and marketing support for launch,  banking partners,  business development contacts, developer tools discounts all with the goal of eliminating as much friction as possible and helping founders focus on product/market fit discovery and execution. Networking - Within each program, founders develop relationships with like-minded entrepreneurs and most programs offer guest speakers typically luminaries and previously successful founders to speak about their startup experiences. 500Startups, among others, offers mentor networks . Fund raising assistance (aka Demo Day) - These events are designed to build auction pressure in financings by generating simultaneous investor interest. Ramen funds - Most programs offer between $10k to $150k in ramen money. It’s just enough to get someone started. Office space - Only a few incubators offer office space and many of them at a fee. General Assembly in New York and Founder’s Den in San Francisco are two great examples. Brand - Every graduate of an accelerator program can use the the brand of the program as proof of credibility. These incubators/accelerators are the graduate schools for entrepreneurship and have a very important role in the ecosystem. They may not be right for every company, but these incubators build the hubs of successful entrepreneurship communities. And I hope they continue to thrive.

Every investment requires a leap of faith, an emotional act that’s not pure reason, and that’s got to carry you through in the inevitable many months, sometimes years, of horrific bad stuff that comes with the company.  And you’ve got to have that energy, that sustaining belief to carry you through, because if you don’t, then  you regret having done it.  So when I have regret, it’s when I didn’t have that, and I’d logically talked myself into [the investment] and checked the boxes.  So it was really helpful [to have a failed investment] that taught me, ‘don’t invest like that.’  You have to have the love affair, and if you don’t, then you shouldn’t do it. Peter Fenton said this in a Stanford Business School case I happened to read over the weekend. The sentiment resonates deeply with me. Every investment is an emotional commitment to support and grow the business and to build long-lasting relationships with the founders. More important, though, is the founder’s love affair. The investor’s commitment is after all a tiny simulacrum of the founders'. In the quote above, swapping the word investor for entrepreneur and what results is profound and true. Every startup requires a leap of faith, an emotional act that’s not pure reason, and that’s got to carry you through in the inevitable many months, sometimes years, of horrific bad stuff that comes with the company.  And you’ve got to have that energy, that sustaining belief to carry you through, because if you don’t, then  you regret having done it.  So when I have regret, it’s when I didn’t have that, and I’d logically talked myself into [the startup ] and checked the boxes.  So it was really helpful [to have a failed startup ] that taught me, ‘don’t found a company like that.’  You have to have the love affair, and if you don’t, then you shouldn’t do it. Find your love affair.

We are in the heyday of SaaS. The conference spanned 20+ buildings, served 60,000+ attendees and was sponsored by more than 300 vendors. Free food everywhere.  Skullcandy wireless headphone giveaways. DJs in every corner. Four square play areas on fake grass outside. It is one huge party. Benioff delivered a tremendous keynote. I wish I could speak in public with his confidence, control and passion. Dreamforce created the perception that Salesforce is at the center of a huge ecosystem of their own creation, which inspires confidence in customers and partners. Social is the buzzword. After the BuddyMedia and Radian6 acquisitions, this is no surprise. Salesforce manages a torrent of brands: Chatter, ChatterBox, Do, Desk, Data.com, Heroku, Social Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud, Services Cloud, etc. It’s confusing to customers but indicative of their ambition. At some point, startups will need to evaluate platform risk, asking hard questions like which categories will Salesforce compete or let others thrive. Chatterbox is a well-built product. It lacks some of key features including security and documents association with client records (Box’s key feature), but it will get there. At Redpoint, we use Salesforce to run internal deal tracking and logging processes; we use Dropbox for file storage and Yammer for chatting. I could envision swapping out Dropbox and Yammer for Chatter and Chatterbox. Marketing automation companies claimed the center of the expo with the biggest booths. Sales technology has outpaced marketing technology. Marketers are clamoring for the same insights from customer data. This demand is driving four bustling companies Marketo, Eloqua, Silverpop, and Pardot. The excitement was palpable and indicative of the enormous wave SaaS has become.

At a recent meeting, David Barrett, one of the founders of Expensify, drew this diagram when explaining his company’s structure. He has overlaid the core teams of a company with a conversion funnel. It’s brilliantly simple. As every SaaS startup transitions from development to growth, the company must supplement the engineering and product capability with sales, marketing and account management. This diagram is the simplest way to show how they work together harmoniously at a strategic level. Marketing builds a prospect pipeline. Product and engineering qualify and activate the prospects into leads for the sales team to close as paying customers. And account management retains customers with great service. From this diagram, the measures of tactical success are plain to see. How quickly is marketing growing the prospect funnel? How well is product converting prospects to qualified leads? At what rate and at what contract value can sales close customers? How effectively can account management retain customers? It goes without saying that each group relays feedback to the other. The account management team relays top complaints from customers to product. Marketing provides the positioning to the sales team. And sales teams transition customers to account managers. Of course, mechanizing these processes are the bigger challenge. But this diagram provides a great map to achieve the goal.

The throwaway line in pitches these days is “we’ll sell our data.” Most of the time, this notion is wrong. Data is the most valuable outcome of building a successful product. It’s the insight, the secret , the keys to the kingdom. Don’t sell the keys to the kingdom. Data provides economies of scale and insights used to develop huge barriers to entry and it should be kept within an organization. Internal data use is the path to building a huge business. For example, imagine if Google had sold user click data. The company would be worth a tiny fraction of its $160B market cap. Or had Facebook sold its graph? Or had Amazon sold customer purchase data? Each would have peddled any hope of large scale success for a nickel. Data is a moat. For Google, clickstreams are the richest data set for improving search.  Google has the lion’s share of queries ( 67% ) which means Google can use the best data to keep improving their search. It’s the same story for ads. Whoever shows the most ads, drives the most clicks, will have more data and better performing ad systems. This is no different for retailers. The biggest merchants (Amazon, Walmart) have the best purchase stream data which means they can make the best product recommendations (not to mention benefit from economies of scale in the supply chain). McKinsey estimates retailers can improve margin by 60% with the right data. It’s rare that technology differentiates companies. Today, insights, execution and institutional knowledge define the winners - data defines the winners. So, keep your data. Use it to build insights and erect huge barriers to entry. Selling data, even for millions of dollars, is selling the business short.

SMB SaaS companies cannot afford to pay for distribution. At 2 to 4% conversion to paid rates and $5 to $10 monthly subscription fees,  the breakeven CPC for these products on search is $0.40. The average Google click costs three times this and the iOS average cost-per-install is more than twice as expensive. The most successful SMB SaaS companies (Zendesk, Expensify, Square) build communities to drive distribution. Those communities reinforce and build a brand. And the brand drives subsequent organic distribution. Expensify and ZenDesk are two great examples. Expensify focuses on users suffering with the greatest relevant pain: salespeople filing expenses. Salespeople are a great target community because they try new products quickly, are very vocal with their support or displeasure and are tremendous networkers. Winning their support means thousands of tweets/brand impressions like these monthly: ZenDesk markets their support suite to the tightly knit group of customer support agents. They leverage the community’s pre-existing strong ties to spread the word about the product. And word of mouth distribution blossomed. The product of these efforts are plain to see in search query volume:
![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_238_238048479) Communities hold the power to large scale, inexpensive distribution. Find the right one and harness it to grow your business organically.

Culturally, we tend to associate leadership with extroversion and attach less importance to judgment, vision and mettle. We prize leaders who are eager talkers over those who have something to say. Must great leaders be gregarious? Susan Cain wrote an OpEd this weekend in the Times containing the quote above. In Silicon Valley, the culture seems very much to embrace the idea of introverted leadership. One might even say the two kinds of leaders live in harmony. On one hand, there are the garrulous Jobs, Benioff, Ellison and on the other there are the taciturn Schmidt, Page and Zuckerberg.  All six of these leaders possess judgment, vision and mettle. Some lead from the front, voices booming and flags unfurled, and some lead from the back, plotting and coding. But ultimately, they all lead. And that’s the most critical part.

Last year, I set a goal of adding 100 followers each week starting at 2000.  I crossed the 3500 follower mark on Twitter this week. I’ve fallen a bit behind that goal but I have a wonderful group of people who actively engage with me on Twitter who are interested in the same things I am. As I’ve been cultivating this audience and community, I kept asking myself a question: who are most of these followers? Who retweets me? Who should I meet in person and build a deeper relationship with? In other words, how do I use social media to build a business development pipeline? I imagine this problem is common across social media marketers. I’ve looked for solutions to help me solve this problem. First, the Twitter clients like Hootsuite and Tweetdeck. Then, the Twitter analysis tools like Klout and Community and FollowerWonk. But each failed to help me prioritize because Twitter profiles are incomplete. They simply don’t provide enough data. So I built my own tool to bridge the Twitter graph and the LinkedIn graph. First, I ping the Twitter API for my followers' Twitter usernames, names and follower counts with a ruby script and dump those details into a csv file. Then, I ask someone on oDesk to map these Twitter usernames to LinkedIn URLs. This costs less than $50 for the 3500 contacts and about 50% of the Twitter user names turn up LinkedIn profiles using Google. (Hat-tip to Brett Berson). Next, I crawl each LinkedIn url for the position, company and location of the user. At last, I have a list of Twitter followers with full work information which I refresh every few weeks. This forms the basis of my business development pipeline. As a marketing channel, social media is second-to-none. But in order for social media to benefit marketers and business development teams, social graphs must be combined to build a more complete profile of users. NB: I tried mapping Twitter usernames to LinkedIn profiles using the LinkedIn APi, but as far as I can tell, the LinkedIn API doesn’t support this.

When serving B2B customers, your pricing will be dictated by your customers' margins. The more money they make, the more they can pay for new technology. Most businesses fund new initiatives including marketing and technology projects from profits. The more profits a company generates the greater their willingness to pay for services and ultimately the larger the market size for a startup. Let’s compare the margins of grocery stores to restaurants to software companies to prove the point. Type Grocery Restaurant Software Name Safeway Chili’s (Brinker) Intuit Market Cap in $B 3.9 2.6 17.6 Revenue in $B 44.1 2.8 4.2 EBITDA in $B 2.7 0.36 1.4 EBITDA per location in $M 1.3 0.35 58 On a percentage basis, Intuit is more than three times as profitable as Brinker which is in turn twice as profitable as Safeway. This means Intuit’s budget for new projects and initiatives is much bigger and they should be willing to spend more. Many startups focus on restaurants or grocery stores whose ability to pay for new projects is limited by their relatively small profit pool. The average Safeway store sells about $25M of merchandise annually, but generates about $2.7M in profit. These dollars are pulled in many directions: covering potential losses incurred through the year, remodeling, new online marketing initiatives and  ideally profits. Projects like mobile coupon applications or loyalty systems demand dollars also demand dollars from this pool of cash. Due to the relatively small potential revenues from in restaurants, startups serving these customer segments have to build very efficient sales teams or online customer acquisition tools to aggregate many of them inexpensively. Restaurants simply can’t afford to pay very much. On the other hand, startups targeting software makers have more flexibility in their approach because these companies generate multiples more profit. So these startups can afford higher paid sales teams. Ultimately, the startups serving higher profit customers will be more profitable, because margins cascade down the value chain.

“Facebook has built the cities, they’ve built the town squares” Dave Morin , founder of Path Is building a social network is like building a city? I watched Urbanize , a documentary describing urban design and the affordances cities must make to cultivate vibrant communities. The words of urban designers echoed many of the challenges faced by networks as they grow. First, both must balance growth and community. Growing a city from 1M to 10M is like adding 900 semi-close friends to your top 100. All of a sudden, the community has a different vibe - each person recognizes fewer and fewer other people (it’s an n-squared problem, after all). It’s challenging to maintain warmth and the closeness of a tight knit small town. This is the tension urban designers and product managers must manage. Second, the most appealing cities have wonderful, inviting public parks and squares, eg the Mall in Washington or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. Social networks also need public places for groups to assemble and for voices to be heard to enact change or draw attention to causes. Third, citizens of cities and networks demand a sense of security. In Durban, where crime rates soared at nighttime, the government built tall buildings along a common path with lots of light and the path became a safe place.  In social networks, the community also policies activities and members using the report spam flags to shine light on offenders. Of course, cultivating social networks and cities are quite different. But perhaps the practice of community product management and urban design share some common principles.

It’s a common refrain that venture backed IPOs have struggled in the past decade. For a long time, I believed and wrote supporting arguments underscoring the idea that the principal causes of this decline were Sarbanes-Oxley costs, decreasing equity coverage and decimalization of exchanges . But that’s wrong. A paper published earlier this year uses statistics to debunk these hypotheses. In “Where have all the IPOs gone?”, a team of statisticians concludes small cap tech IPOs are struggling because today’s public candidates aren’t profitable when then file. Nor are they very profitable at all. Small Caps Are Unprofitable and Don’t Turn the Corner Below is a chart copied from the paper that shows the unprofitable percentage of small IPOs (those with less than $50M in trailing 12 months' revenue) and large IPOs.  The fraction of small IPOs with negative EBITDA has doubled to nearly 90% in about 30 years. Small IPOs Large IPOs Number % < 0 Number % < 0 1980-1989 508 44% 168 21% 1990-1998 979 65% 411 31% 1999-2000 472 90% 120 72% 2001-2009 192 79% 186 34% Once public, profits don’t improve. In the last 20 years, 80% of small cap companies hadn’t generated a profit in the first 3 years after IPO. Public investors punished them for it. Small caps share prices fell -10%. On the other hand, large caps grew in value by 27% in the same period. 80% of these companies generated profits in the 3 years following the IPO. (See pages 38 and 39 of the paper). In short, small caps are utterly unattractive investment candidates for public market investors. With all the talk about the decreasing costs to start a company because of the cloud and elastic computing, why are today’s small companies less profitable and ultimately far less successful in the public markets? It’s a conundrum - a secret in Thiel’s language . Reasons for Small Cap Struggles I don’t have the answer. But there are several theories. First, board directors are encouraging companies to remain unprofitable longer to pursue bigger outcomes. Second, the tech industry’s structure lends itself to economies of scale require small companies to operate at a significant disadvantage. Third, the decreasing costs of starting a company are increasing competition and eroding margins. Startups may be managed differently. For example, Documentum filed for IPO in 1996 with $15M in ttm revenue and $0.5M in profit. MMC Networks filed in 1998 with $14M in ttm revenue and $0.5M in profit.  We don’t see these IPOs today. Instead, venture capital growth funds are financing these companies at these stages. Perhaps these investors are encouraging companies to continue to finance growth with negative profits, a trend that continues through the public offering but ultimately, isn’t the best decision for shareholders. The authors of the paper speculate economies of scale are to play - larger companies operate more efficient sales channels, close higher value customers and leverage distribution strength to develop near monopolies. As a result, smaller companies face greater costs in bringing products to market because of longer sales cycles and greater competition.  This argument favors stronger FTC involvement in anti-trust regulation. Lastly, perhaps, the decreasing costs of starting tech companies are creating more entrants. Without significant barriers to entry, new entrants use lower prices and freemium strategies to win market share. Such strategies ultimately reduce price points and decrease the value of a market reducing profitability for all market players. No matter the cause, this paper does underscore the value of building a profitable business is disproportionately rewarded in the public markets for small cap companies.

There is a Branch called Do platforms need to give users a number to optimize? Most platforms do provide a number to optimize: Twitter followers, Facebook friends and so on. These metrics build liquidity in the platform as @satyap, @ev and @hunterwalk point out. But there isn’t just one type of social metric. There are three. It’s important to distinguish the types of metrics a community can provide for users to optimize, because the community will rally around the metrics the community provides. The long term dynamics may not be the expected or desired behavior. In my view, there are three types of social metrics: User metrics Social validation metrics (Twitter followers, Facebook friends/followers, LinkedIn connections, Klout score) - are proxies for trust or respect within a community. They are useful as trust signals and for initial social graph growth. Content metrics Engagement metrics (YouTube views, app downloads, Quora views) - demonstrate the popularity of an item and activity of the community broadly. Seeing a post with 212 likes immediately provides a sense of a large user base. These metrics are the least valuable measure because they can be manipulated easily. Behavior Metrics Karma metrics (retweets, likes, up votes, Hacker News Karma, content flags, spam indicators) - Karma metrics measure positive and negative contributions to the community by combining user centric metrics like influence with content quality metrics.  Pinterest and Tumblr have gradations of behavior (like vs repin/reblog). Karma metrics enforce a social filter on content because when users retweet or like, they are expending their social capital to promote or endorse some content. When to use each metric At the outset of a community, the primary goal is to build a trusted network of contributors who extol and enforce the values of a community. Therefore, user metrics seem to be the most important. As communities evolve, some sites pursue content metrics, but I think the most vibrant communities ultimately pursue and champion behavior metrics because they can be actively managed to encourage the desired user behavior. The best behavior metrics have some vagueness, some room to evolve in order to respond to changes in community behavior. For example, Facebook is trying to mitigate the fake like problem Communities are living entities, like cities, that need to be cultivated, nurtured and maintained. Metric selection is an essential component of this evolution.

Over the weekend, I watched Page One, a documentary which chronicles the turmoil occurring within the New York Times in 2009 and 2010 when newspapers were going out of business all over the country. Many wondered if the Times would also file for bankruptcy. Three confluent factors spelled imminent demise for the newspaper: the Internet cannibalized subscription revenue, advertising dollars evaporated and news distribution was in upheaval on account of Wikileaks, Twitter, and blogs. The scale of these shifts was enormous: advertising revenue had crashed to 1950 levels, eliminating five decades of growth in just a few years. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_245_843158597" width="500px"> Impressively, the New York Times has survived the crisis. Although the company’s value has declined by 75%, the Gray Lady generates about $1.3B in revenue and is profitable. 10% of revenues originate from digital subscriptions, evidence the paper is mastering a new art form - making money on the web. Every company faces challenges in its history. The New York Times' struggle, depicted in this movie, highlighted some wonderful lessons on how to handle these crises. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_245_892586192" width="500px"> First, the management of the company reaffirmed their core values. The editor, Tom Bodkin, spoke to his team pledging to maintain the top quality journalism and a commitment to truth the Times had always championed. Second, the management team reduced its staff to a sustainable level. The anguish is plain to see both in employees and the management team, but it was essential to make these hard choices. Third, Bodkin and his team embraced the transformation of the industry, pursuing technology advances and pushing the journalistic envelope, with the goal of restoring the brand of the Times as the vanguard of journalism. In terms of technology, the company built an iPad application , hired a new group in the research and development team to focus on digital advertising products , and launched a content paywall . Each of these initiatives faced criticism ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_245_712469188" width="500px"> In terms of journalism, the Times adapted to new information sources and writers. The Times published Wikileaks documents supplied by Julian Assange , associating their old guard brand with a new form of activism/journalism - a very controversial move both internally and externally. In addition, the company hired a handful of young bloggers to incorporate a disruptive medium into their product. Since 2009, the NY Times has created more than 40 successful blogs. These bold actions, which respected the core values of the company, saved  the NYTimes from irrelevance. The movie does present a very idealistic and one sided view of the company and the nuances of managing through a crisis like this are much more challenging than I may have made them appear in this summary, but the big blocks of strategy championed by the movie and undertaken by the management are worth highlighting. By plunging the company into the new form of media, understanding the industry changes, and becoming agents of change themselves, the Timesmen were able to save the business during a great crisis, avoiding irrelevance and disruption by embracing innovation. Today, the NYTimes remains at the forefront of journalism and will for many years.

The most effective financing processes, like the most effective auctions, create scarcity. Of late, many founders have been triggering pre-emptive financing processes for their raises. This is my interpretation of their playbook. Strategy First, founders build credibility with investors. This can be done in many ways like cultivating a long term relationship with a handful of VCs or in less direct ways like brand building through social media and blogging. Founders have established credibility through referrals from people-in-common. And of course, business performance is the trump card. Walk in with great numbers and you establish your company as an expert. Second, founders create the perception of scarcity, a great tool to seduce investors.  There are many forms of scarcity creation. Trailing a fast moving processes is the most common form of scarcity I’ve observed. Once one investor is engaged, it’s much easier to engage others; ie, “We weren’t raising but someone became really excited and now you’re behind the process. Should we meet?” Gameplan How does a team build that momentum? One common gameplan: About 3 months before a fund raise, founders call a handful of VCs to provide an update on the business and indicate the company is contemplating a fund raising in about 3 to 6 months. They typically ask for advice on the process. What kinds of metrics and milestones excite investors enough to invest? What questions do they foresee their partners asking? What challenges to the business exist that the pitch must address? A month or two or three later, founders follow up with an update to explain the progress on the key questions investors raised with the goal of triggering a meeting before the official process begins. By asking for expectations and then beating them, founders establish the business’s momentum and reaffirm credibility with an investor. With the first meeting down, and others in the pipeline, it’s a race to the finish, with the goal of getting to term sheets and closing as fast as possible. Every once in a while a business is growing so quickly, or is just such a wonderful idea that no effort is required on the part of the company and investors pursue pre-emptive rounds actively. In that case, this playbook is moot. Pros and Cons There are many advantages to entice investors to engage early. Startups aren’t expected to have prepared as many materials as those engaging in a “formal” process. An early process has the potential to eliminate financing risk much earlier than expected. Founders can steer the financing to investors of their choice with more control than a standard process. And founders can always point to the pre-emptive nature of the financing as a bargaining tool for better terms. The most common refrain is effective: “You can invest now and get a bargain or I can raise in 6 months at a much higher price as my business continues to grow.” Of course, there are trade-offs. First, like any financing, these processes are time expensive. Second, if the process takes too long to engage any investors, it can be perceived as a failed financing, so timing perceptions must be actively managed. Third, it may not work. Investors may not be receptive because of seasonality (summer doldrums), or macro-economic factors, or business risks/stage. Like Mentos and Diet Coke Preemptive financings don’t happen for every company, but when they do it can be well worth the effort.

In 2010, Gaia Online started a user acquisition campaign to grow their user base. To simplify the on boarding process, they launched the Big Red Button home page below. It worked. Conversion rates from the home page spiked. Simple user experiences, like this big red button, are effective because users understand what is expected of them. There is just one flow. But small features, imperceptible, innocuous features can unexpectedly alter user behavior by adding new flows. The coupon code is a great example of this: The coupon code is a universal UI element in most check out processes. It seems like a great feature. But as an ecommerce expert pointed out to me yesterday, it’s a huge problem. It is a call-to-action to abandon the current cart - a worst case scenario. If a customer has a coupon code, the feature works as expected, and the customer enters the code and pays for their basket. But should a full-price paying consumer stumble across the coupon code, the customer will say to themselves, “Oh, maybe I should find a coupon to get a better deal,” bouncing from the site. Conversion rates plummet. The coupon code introduces a harmful user flow. And the worst part is the product prods the user to pursue this path. Every few months, it’s worth evaluating user flows. Even throwaway features, like coupon codes, can have significant impact on user conversion rates, distracting users from the ultimate goal - using your product.

In every one of my conversations with Peter Lehrman, founder of AxialMarket, he always speaks about AxialMarket as “the business.” Never the company, the startup or any other word. At first blush I thought it was a trivial semantic difference, a New York-ism, but over time I’ve come to realize this word choice marks a significant difference that manifests itself in culture, product and go to market. Calling any company a business connotes a formality the word startup doesn’t share. A business is serious. A business is a stand-alone self sustaining entity.  A business evokes thoughts of goals, revenue, profitability, execution and a performance mentality. On the other hand, the word startup feels exploratory and casual and evokes images of tshirts, jeans, hacking, electric scooters, experimentation - a culture and brand image startups have actively cultivated. It’s not to say many startups aren’t performance-driven organizations using management techniques like scrums and Trello cards, but startup culture doesn’t overtly celebrate blocking and tackling as success.  Nor am I saying businesses don’t embrace the practices that startup culture uses to build innovation engines. They do. Startups and businesses learn from each other. In fact, startups often evolve into businesses. A startup may start as a product and sometimes remain a product forever, eg Instagram, Blogger, Flickr. Sometimes startups become businesses, eg YouTube, Twitter, Facebook. Sometimes businesses are just born that way, eg Yammer, ZenDesk, LinkedIn, Square, AxialMarket. When a startup evolves into a business, it introduces systems to create predictability. Why? Predictability is valuable. It helps with hiring, capital raising, morale, product planning, marketing, and s oon. The best businesses are often called machines because they embody this characteristic. Apple is a consumer products machine. They predictably create insanely great devices. Google is a revenue growth machine - 30% y/y growth every year since they have been a public company - predictably. I think every startup, company and business must maintain tension between creative chaos and a drive toward predictive performance. That’s how they grow and innovate and win. There are many paths to achieving success. Some founders choose to begin as a startup. Others, like Peter, choose to begin as a business. But despite the starting point, each type of company blends skills from the other to succeed.

Many of the promising marketing and media innovations of the past six years, daily deals, subscription ecommerce, social gaming and social media, have been struggling. This trend is plain to see from IPO performance and negative press cycles. I’ve been asked a few times whether there is consumer investment fatigue as a result. Fatigue is too strong a characterization. It would be foolish for any investor to write off consumer investing as a category because of the massive opportunity consumer internet companies offer. The fastest growing and often the largest Internet businesses are consumer businesses: Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, to name a few. Instead, investors are faced with a choice between two strategies. Option 1: pursue a contrarian growth strategy investing in a few consumer Internet companies at similar prices to the previous several years. Implicitly, these investment are bets that new, more lucrative and sustainable revenue streams or more cost effective distribution channels will develop in the next 1 to 3 years that will enable these startups to grow into their valuations with time. Option 2: pursue a value strategy, valuing new consumer companies as traditional ecommerce businesses or internet media businesses rather than conferring the large strategic multiples afforded these businesses over the past 24 months. Invest much earlier and much more broadly, expecting a lower average outcome. It’s too early to tell which strategy is better. It depends on the incumbents successfully developing new revenue models that can be either syndicated to or replicated by new startups. Perhaps new mobile ad technology will enable social networks to flourish. Or changes in app distribution will suddenly render social gaming unit economics much more profitable. Who knows? But consumer investment will continue.

Two weeks ago, James Reinhart, founder and CEO of ThredUp , led his company through a branding exercise. The team spent an afternoon comparing and contrasting the brand attributes of Starbucks and Peets, Whole Foods and Safeway and a few other competitive pairs. The team quickly distilled each company’s brand into one word. Long ago, each of these brand selected the value that would define their brand. Every decision since that point had been made with that value in mind. Netflix: freedom .   Apple: simplicity . Starbucks: quality . Nike: inspiration . Google: focus on the user . Zappos: service Defining a business’s one core value, it’s brand identity, is essential to its success. This core value originates within the company, is reinforced through culture and ultimately permeates the organization through product decisions, marketing copy and customer interaction. Toward the end of the afternoon, James asked the company to perform the brand attribute analysis for ThredUp. The team built a list of ideals and whittled it down to just one or two, arriving at the defining value for the company - the one word all customers, even 25 years hence, will think when someone says “ThredUp.” What will yours be?

Must content distribution platforms be reinvented every few years? Left to its own devices, the mob will augment, accessorize, spam, degrade and noisify whatever they have access to, until it loses beauty and function and becomes something else. Seth Godin Given the noise and misinformation disseminated on Twitter both during the election and the Sandy disaster , I’ve been wondering how Godin’s thoughts apply to new information networks: blogs and feeds. Sifting the feed in search of the truth There is an undeniable early movement toward editorially curated publishing. The Twitter founders have launched the most visible response. Medium , a low volume, high quality content site is a direct (and opposite) reaction to the high volume, noisy Twitter feed. Content proliferation is governed by its half-life In addition to volume reduction, Medium axes another dimension: time. Medium places no dates on its posts. Instead, Medium uses a voting system to judge and display the quality of a particular post. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_251_486525128" width="500px" style="padding: 35px;"> Blogging has used time as the primary dimension for relevance. The posts a visitor should read are the most recent - so the assumption goes. Feeds are no different. In fact, time is the most prevalent quality metric in social products but it shouldn’t be. Content’s half-life is the amount of time required for content to reach half of its lifetime viewership. Relying on time as a proxy for quality accelerates this half-life. The decrease in content’s lifespan makes writing long-form content less worthwhile despite it’s much greater intrinsic value. After all, longer content typically has deeper thought at its root. Jump on the bandwagon Medium is not alone. Svbtle , the platform I write for, is also fostering curated blogging. Arguably, Quora led this trend by focusing on questions. Branch is surfacing debates. Marco Arment’s The Magazine is yet another example . If these efforts succeed, I think we will build the internet into a much better library - a library not made of scraps of paper but of deep and lasting thought - new Alexandria. Queen said it best: So don’t become some background noise A backdrop for the girls and boys Who just don’t know or just don’t care And just complain when you’re not there You had your time, you had the power You’ve yet to have your finest hour Radio - radio All we hear is radio ga ga Radio goo goo Radio ga ga

We negotiate every day in almost every conversation and exchange, whether it’s rescheduling a flight, asking for a product return or responding to a term sheet. I’ve been reading Getting More , a book by Stuart Diamond, who trains the military, Google and many others on negotiation. Everyone should read it. This book is set apart because it recognizes the nature of relationships, emotion and human nature, forgoing concepts like ZOPA and BATNA. Instead, the book focuses on simple, tangible tactics: Write your goals down - Focus on achieving those goals and don’t get bogged down by any tangents. Practice ahead of time - We practice all the time in sports but rarely in business. Little wins - Negotiation is about small concessions. No one succeeds by asking for the moon. Understand the other side - Walk a mile in the other person’s shoes to understand what’s important. So you can…. Trade your low value for their high value - Neither side values things equally. Finding out what’s can be traded at high/low perceived value is the key to enlarging the pie. No emotions , ever. Long term relationships - Life is long and the valley is small. Make sure to build your reputation with your negiotiating behavior. (Hat tip:@jmatus) Negotiation is a universally applicable skill and one which can evoke dramatic changes in our lives. It’s worth investing the time to become better at it.

How much is a social media click worth compared to a email click or a search click for an eCommerce site? Monetate, makers of optimization software for eCommerce landing pages released data answering this question Channel Conversion Rates AOV CPC Relative Worth Email 4.25% 90.4 $1.000 Search 2.49% 82.72 $0.536 Social 0.59% 64.19 $0.0986 Key:
Conversion rates = conversion to order from click;
AOV = average order value in $;
Relative worth = indexed measure of click value based. Today, an email click is worth about 10x as much as a social media click and about twice as much as a search click. NB: These figures don’t take into account email acquisition costs or SEO costs or social media presence costs which might skew the results more favorably in search and social media. Nevertheless, there is tremendous opportunity for startups to discover a the secret to social performance marketing. The two opportunities afforded by this secret are (1) providing better solutions to performance marketers using social media channels to acquire customers and (2) or develop in-house expertise to grow an exceptionally large socially enabled eCommerce business.

At the center of every startup is a secret. A secret is not an unknown. Rather, it’s something just not widely believed to be achievable or feasible. In other words, it’s an insight. Exploiting that secret should be the aim of every entrepreneur. Leveraging the secret means disruption and ultimately success. The genesis of every secret is the word why. “Why are things done this way? Why can’t we do better?” Why is the predecessor to change. It’s the progenitor of every great idea because the word why challenges the status quo. At Google, the founders challenged every assumption. Why can’t we disrupt the advertising industry by changing the way things have been done for decades? Why take a company public in the same way as everyone else?  Why not apply quantitative analysis to hiring decisions? Startups ask why hundreds of times per day. Why will our company change the way an industry works, or create a new industry? Why will we solve this problem better than anyone else? Why does this candidate want to work here? Why will customers choose our products over competitors? People and companies age because they stop learning. They stop asking why. And then, new thought devolves into repetition, innovation collapses to maintenance. With this one word, we poke, pry and wrench secrets from the abyss. Why is how companies innovate.

I love freemium businesses. I have met with many of them, work with one and if I were to start one, this would be my game plan, the characteristics of the product, market, distribution channels, conversion point and team. Product Characteristics The existing solutions are either email and spreadsheets or software architected before the turn of the century. In either case, the alternative is painful to use, so excruciating in fact, that individual employees are willing to circumnavigate IT’s policies in search of something better. The product has a 2 step value proposition. The first proposition is a dead-simple single user experience, ideally in the form of a mobile app. The second proposition is a network effect proposition or multi-player experience. This is key to fast growth and high retention. Mobile games have a wonderful single player user experience. Very few have the network effect. On the hand, Salesforce has both. A salesperson signing up to Salesforce is able to keep track of a customer lead funnel. A manager is able to aggregate data from across all his sales people to better understand and manage the sales team. It’s logical, simple and useful for the manager to pay to access and manage his teams' data. Market Characteristics The market offers either tens of millions of users at low price points or millions of users at higher price points. Freemium funnels typically convert only 2 to 4% of users who try the product. At $10 per seat per month, a startup needs about 10M accounts converting at 4% to reach $50M in revenue. At $100 per seat per month, a startup needs 100,000 accounts. Distribution Tactics My target segment of users has a strong, active community. Freemium’s core growth engine is social proof aka word-of-mouth marketing. To drive word of mouth marketing, a freemium business needs a community, typically an existing one which falls in love with the business’s product. Harnessing this community starts with building a great product. Then, a startup must cultivate and grow their community. Second, hackable distribution channels are a sine qua non. Freemium business must either leverage new distribution platforms or develop novel tactics on existing distribution platforms. In sailing, the first place boat always copies the second place boat’s movements to keep the distance between them the same. So the second place boat has to do something radical - act in a way the first place boat would never dare. Danielle Morrill articulates this point beautifully in Creating an Unfair Distribution Advantage Conversion Point The conversion to paid point feels natural because a user derives enough value from the product that living without it is too painful. Successful freemium products have a conversion point to paid at the point the customer understands the value proposition and is already committed to the product. I think there are 4 ways to trigger conversion to paid: Limited time trial: user pays after 14 days or 30 days after enough time has passed to kick the tires on the product. Money back guarantee: user pays on sign up but can cancel at any time. Utility upsell: user pays after a certain amount of data has been uploaded into the system, or a certain number of seats in a given company have been activated. Limited functionality: user pays to integrate into other systems or to access pro-level features like exporting data or collaborating with a team. Passion Above all, the team must have conviction and passion about the problem they are solving. Freemium businesses often take years to grow linearly before reaching exponential growth. Through it all, dedication to building the best product for the customer is essential.

Developing a sales strategy is critical for software-as-a-service (SaaS) startups. The first step in developing a sales strategy is to build a robust market segmentation. I’ve used data from the US Census to develop a segmentation that reveals some surprising facts about the SMB market and may help inform your startup’s sales strategy. Chart 1: 98% of businesses in the US employ fewer than 100 people. 98% of businesses in the US employ between 1 to 4 people. This large segment of businesses provides ample testing ground for product development, market fit validation and creation of word-of-mouth marketing. Chart 2 : Only 1,000 companies employ greater than 10,000 employees and 12,409 employ greater than 500 employees. Compared to the small business part of the market, there are far fewer potential customers - only about 12,500. Charts 3 & 4: The 4 market segments by revenue Ultimately, the number of firms in a given segment shouldn’t dictate sales strategy.  Instead, the total number of employees within a segment (avg. employment per firm x number of firms) determines the revenue potential by segment. For example, there are more employees working for companies from 20 to 500 people, about 39M, than there are working for companies with greater than 10,000 employees, about 33M. In this case, the smaller business represents a larger revenue opportunity. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_256_234810560) Accounting for number of firms and total employment, I have divided the market into 4 segments, each demarcated by a different color, below. While the 20 to 500 person company and the 5000+ employee company segments represent the two largest segments by revenue opportunity, each of the four segments is roughly equal in size, about one quarter of the 121M US workers. Payroll Segmentation @aloo pointed out to me that it may not be fair to look at all seats carry equal  revenue opportunity. To get a better sense of potential seat value, I used average payroll by company size as a proxy for per seat IT expenses. The chart is below and doesn’t differ dramatically from the previous chart. The 10k+ employee category grows a few percentage points at the expense of the others. The average 10k+ employee company pays their staff about 40% more than a 1 to 10 person company and the effect is borne out in the data. The key for startup strategy selection is matching distribution strengths with market segments. It’s possible to build successful businesses serving any of these segments individually or a combination. No matter the segment you may choose to target, understanding the customer base is the critical first step to devising a successful product, sales and marketing strategy.

Developing a sales strategy is critical for software-as-a-service (SaaS) startups. The first step in developing a sales strategy is to build a robust market segmentation. I’ve used data from the US Census to develop a segmentation that reveals some surprising facts about the SMB market and may help inform your startup’s sales strategy. Chart 1: 98% of businesses in the US employ fewer than 100 people. 98% of businesses in the US employ between 1 to 4 people. This large segment of businesses provides ample testing ground for product development, market fit validation and creation of word-of-mouth marketing. Chart 2 : Only 1,000 companies employ greater than 10,000 employees and 12,409 employ greater than 500 employees. Compared to the small business part of the market, there are far fewer potential customers - only about 12,500. Charts 3 & 4: The 4 market segments by revenue Ultimately, the number of firms in a given segment shouldn’t dictate sales strategy.  Instead, the total number of employees within a segment (avg. employment per firm x number of firms) determines the revenue potential by segment. For example, there are more employees working for companies from 20 to 500 people, about 39M, than there are working for companies with greater than 10,000 employees, about 33M. In this case, the smaller business represents a larger revenue opportunity. ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_256_234810560) Accounting for number of firms and total employment, I have divided the market into 4 segments, each demarcated by a different color, below. While the 20 to 500 person company and the 5000+ employee company segments represent the two largest segments by revenue opportunity, each of the four segments is roughly equal in size, about one quarter of the 121M US workers. Payroll Segmentation @aloo pointed out to me that it may not be fair to look at all seats carry equal  revenue opportunity. To get a better sense of potential seat value, I used average payroll by company size as a proxy for per seat IT expenses. The chart is below and doesn’t differ dramatically from the previous chart. The 10k+ employee category grows a few percentage points at the expense of the others. The average 10k+ employee company pays their staff about 40% more than a 1 to 10 person company and the effect is borne out in the data. The key for startup strategy selection is matching distribution strengths with market segments. It’s possible to build successful businesses serving any of these segments individually or a combination. No matter the segment you may choose to target, understanding the customer base is the critical first step to devising a successful product, sales and marketing strategy.

Hollywood and Silicon Valley often seems worlds apart. While movie making and startup building may always be very different endeavors, great managers use the same techniques in every discipline to empower their teams, hire the right people, and change the world. Over the weekend, I watched Woody Allen: A Documentary which profiles the great director through the words of his actors, editors and producers. Allen’s management ability shone through every interview. Work in every role within your team. Woody has performed every major key role within a film: actor, writer, director. Because he understands the nuances of each role, he can articulate the characteristics for the right hire, he can evaluate job quality, and he can speak with authority. Hire great people and get out of their way. Allen relies on his actors’ own internal motivation to elicit great performances. Actors interviewed in the documentary said Allen was the least hands on director and consequently the best they had worked with. When actors did solicit feedback, Allen explored their challenges with them, showing them tape and letting the actor reach the right conclusion. Be aggressive. Try new things. Allen is the most prolific filmmaker in history setting a pace of 1 movie per year for 40 years. Many of those films have been flops or failures. But he has a litany of awards including 4 Oscars. In his own words, he says he is unafraid to fail. Build it because you love it. Despite his fame, Allen has never made movies that were certain to be commercially viable. Instead, he worked on projects that excited him. He explored new ideas like the all black and white “Shadows and Fog”, tinkered with novel technology that transposed his face on famous scenes in “Zelig” and tested his hypotheses for new ways of approaching old stories “Midnight in Paris”. As a result, he created a system of values for his teams of genuine passion. Passion elicits the best work. These practices are useful for every employee, manager and founder at a startup. All great managers are alike.

For years, a product can grow linearly before suddenly seeing compounding growth. Facebook is a great example. From 2004 to 2007, the company grew at a fairly linear rate. And then, the magic happened! The network effects kicked in and exponential growth ensued. Linear growth always precedes exponential growth. For market places, in social networks or in advertising exchanges, the story is always the same. Linear, linear, linear. BOOM, exponential. One day, the magic happens. I saw this first hand at Branchout. If you ask Rick Marini, Stan Chudnovsky and the Branchout team how they grew from 1M to 25M users in a matter of weeks, and I did at a Redpoint portfolio company event focused on viral growth, they won’t offer you any defined roadmap. Instead, they will point to a series of small, linear, consistent improvements leading to an avalanche. This is the story behind every exponential growth story. Because humans are exceptionally terrible at distinguishing the difference between linear growth and early exponential growth, we cannot predict the avalanche. We can only continue to trudge through the snow, all the time making our products a little bit better at a time.

Did you hear ‘em talkin’ ‘bout it on the radio Did you try to read the writing on the wall Did that voice inside you say I’ve heard it all before It’s like Deja Vu all over again - John Fogerty I am emotionally attached to Android’s success. It’s the same loyalty I displayed when I campaigned for Apple in the mid-90s. But with a tinge of betrayal. I reminisce about spending hours sifting through Zapf dingbats to transform PC Word files into usable Mac documents; choosing from a threadbare gaming library comprising three titles: Bungie’s Marathon series, SimCity and Civ; and waiting years for updates to Quicken and the Office Suite. It’s like deja vu all over again. Android’s software offering is smaller, inferior, and slower to market than iOS. ![image]( https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_259_569514338" width=“500px”/> History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.  In the late 90s, Apple’s market share hovered around 5%. Unlike Apple, Android doesn’t suffer from a marketshare disadvantage. On the contrary, Android is used by a 51% of American smart phone users. Instead, Android suffers from a mindshare disadvantage: the savviest technologists prefer Apple products. And for good reason. It’s fair to fault Android’s device and OS fragmentation challenges, second-rate hardware and software integration, content availability. But Android has strokes of brilliance: the intelligent notifications bar, Google Now, fully functional navigation, true multi-tasking and my favorite: the Intents system which enables applications to send data to each other. Most importantly, I love Android’s dream. Android’s vision is to be the developer’s platform. Google uses the word hacker at its developer conferences. Hugo Barra, the head PM for Android called on developers to “Hack the Nexus,” a phrase never to be uttered about an iPhone at WWDC.  This message should resonate with the developer community, but successful app development is still too challenging on Android for the reasons listed above. My passion for Android is every bit as irrational as my loyalty to Apple in the late 90s. I’d never thought I’d root against Apple. I guess I just have a thing for the underdog.

Clarity is everything in a startup. That’s why metrics can be such a great help. But not all metrics are created equal. One of my CEOs recently shared with me the way he thinks about metrics. I thought it was simple and brilliant. There are 3 kinds of metrics in a business: Vanity metrics are great indicators of momentum. These are useful for garnering press, investment and partnering interest. But they most often aren’t the end goal, the metrics that correlate to a business’s value. Business health metrics are high level metrics about the business. Revenue is a prime example. User activity is a second. Conversion-to-paid is a third. These metrics tend to be the ones shared with the board and leadership of the company. Goals can be established for these metrics and the health of the company’s initiatives can be measured in comparison to these goals.\ Product decision metrics inform product, marketing, sales or other team level decisions. Examples include cost-per-customer-acquisition per channel, % of users using a particular feature, etc.
Think through what kinds of metrics you and your team are focused on and run them through this filter. It will help you prioritize the right things.

Facebook is asking me to redefine my closest 7 friends. I logged into Facebook today to see this new feature, starring your friends. Below this text is a Google circles like UI that asks me to star friends whose updates are particularly important to me. With hundreds of friends, the average Facebook user logs in to see wall of updates that aren’t quite relevant. Some of us have reduced our friend graphs and unfriended contacts in order to return the feed to relevance, which isn’t a desired user behavior. Facebook, after all, wants to encourage expansive graphs. The challenge that feeds everywhere face is the local minimum problem. Machine learning algorithms like EdgeRank can easily fall into local minimums, where the same people appear on the feed because they’ve been appearing on the feed. The people in the feed become stale and either the model has to be rebuilt or a strong signal must be injected into the algorithm to change results. This beta feature might indicate Facebook is looking for another strong signal of friend-closeness, to recenter the feed on the people a user most cares about and return relevance to the feed. Or it might indicate a push to build new features around a top 7 friend list.

Apple has built the most successful tech ecosystem of the past ten years. And they have done it, surprisingly, by dictating the rules of that ecosystem. Compare iOS and Android. To win, both needed to develop initially 2 but eventually 3 things: A mobile OS Mobile hardware to run the OS And later, the content ecosystem Apple controls nearly every aspect of this stack, from the prices of books and movies, to the place where apps are downloaded, to the payment mechanisms, down to the advertising and user tracking. Incredibly, this worked. The movie studios agreed. Book publishers agreed. App developers agreed. Users agreed (and supplied 400M credit cards).  By total ecosystem revenue, Apple has built an ecosystem 6.5 times larger than Android: Apple has paid $5B to developers and Google less than $750M. Each ecosystem and its history are very different. Apple’s early ecosystem commanded a very small group of die-hard developers to build complementary applications on proprietary hardware. On the other hand, Windows embraced commoditization of hardware to win share and build a massive ecosystem. More recently, Facebook built an ecosystem as a by product of sheer user growth of their core product. Twitter created and destroyed their ecosystem of clients and are now building a new data ecosystem. Apple will always be defined by its unwillingness to compromise. iOS is no different. The question I have is, why did this unwillingness to compromise suddenly work?

Although today’s society is said to be in a state of information overload, in fact it may not be in excess. It’s just an overflow of odd and fragmented information in the media. The amount of information in each fragment is in fact quite small. In this slew of half baked information, isn’t the brain oppressed? The stress on the brain isn’t because of quantity, but because of limited quality. Kenya Hara, Designing Design Design is philosophy for the modern age. I can think of no more relevant example than this one from Hara’s book. We’re in a messy milieu: a morass of links, images and text without sense or order or thought. It’s time for us to rethink the way we consume information now that we’re swimming in it. ![image]( https://res.cloudinary.com/dzawgnnlr/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_auto/image_262_419349607" width=“500px”/> First there were RSS feeds (Google Reader). Who didn’t open it up to 1000+ articles to read with half of them duplicates? Then there were social feeds (Facebook & Twitter) which now have edgerank and are selectively chosen based on interaction signals. Then, news aggregators like HackerNews or TechMeme arose. Today, we’re in the midst of crowdsourced content curation.  But these approaches haven’t solved the the first problem, the RSS problem. On Quora, the answers to the question, “What’s the next big UI innovation?” are all technology driven : real time feeds, screen size updates, content pushing & recommendations. But these aren’t UI improvements - they are middleware infrastructure improvements that have been granted affordances in UI. We’re missing real UI improvement as it pertains to information. Some of this is happening in visual data design. “Amanda Cox at the NYTimes weaves stories with R and huge data sets. Perhaps this is where it all starts. Because it can’t just end at a nice grid layout with elegant whitespace in Flipboard. UIs must start telling us stories, instead of whispers of sentences.

I met a seasoned executive recently. He made a bold claim. “Management is an art, and one that is overwhelmingly undervalued in Silicon Valley.” I wondered, are we investing enough in our managers? Talent is the largest investment of an early stage company. 80%+ of startup operating expense flows to compensation. Retaining these employees is good business. Especially in such an expensive and competitive talent market. Research shows employees leave their jobs because of poor leadership and poor management . All managers in a company influence employee retention -  from the C-level to the line manager. This is why investing in each creates a competitive advantage. Suppose the average manager has a span of control of seven . Seven people’s compensation might total an annual budget of $1.5M to $3M. That’s a quite an investment for an early stage company. A manager influences a significant fraction of an early stage startup’s employee base. 7 of 30 is 23%. 7 of 50 is 14%. Managers have broad influence within an organization. The more senior the manager, the more people they influence, the greater the benefit or damage they can do. And that extends all the way to the highest level: the CEO. Management quality is public today, available in tools like Glassdoor. These reviews accelerate or retard recruiting efforts. A great management culture provides a competitive edge when hiring talent. There are several ways of measuring the effectiveness of a manager.  360° performance reviews of managers every six months for every year. Employee satisfaction ratings performed on a monthly basis. Skip level meetings where the managers of the managers meet with direct reports. And of course analyzing attrition both regretted and non-regretted attrition by manager. These are important metrics. How should startup invest in improving its management? Management coaches are an excellent way to do this. I was skeptical at first, but I can’t overstate the impact of my coach at Google. Second, mentorship: surround leaders with experienced advisors who can guide. Education is important. One of the startups I work with has an MBA club. They meet monthly, read management books and discuss the best ways to deploy the strategies in the startup. Most of all, the startup must value the practice of management.

The UK is just starting to enforce EU’s cookie consent law . Visit the FT for the first time in a while and you’ll see: In effect, this law requires consumers to define a Personal API. Consumers carry a trove of data: browsing data, ad click data, friend network data and social sharing data. Web businesses have realized the value of that data ( $12B in 2011 ). This EU law encourages consumers to become aware of the value of this data and manage it. The notion of a Personal API isn’t new. In fact, we’ve all defined some parts of our personal API on Facebook. Facebook application install dialogue boxes prompt us to evaluate the cost-benefit of data sharing. Although results vary widely across applications, these kinds of prompts curtail user adoption to the chagrin of developers. After Facebook increased the granularity of permissions on these boxes last year, some developers observed a 20% decline in user installs . The increase in data collection transparency is inexorable because consumers are paying more attention. Since 2004, Facebook has been convincing users to share ever increasing amounts of data, to dramatic effect. The company has erected the social infrastructure of the Internet. But the majority of Facebook users distrust the service . This fear isn’t unique to Facebook. New entrants, including Path, must also manage user trust . As a result of this fraying trust, web businesses must refine a new core competency: convincing users to share their user data before experiencing an application. Part of the challenge is marketing a product’s allure. But this is the simpler problem. Update: the EU changed the bill immediately before it was signed into law to allow implied consent. By visiting the site, a user accepts data use. Consumer education presents the more significant challenge. Most consumers don’t understand the mechanisms or implications of data sharing. First there is technology complexity. There are several flavors of cookie: browser sessions, true cookies, HTML5 local storage and mobile application local data store. Cookie consent restrictions are applied unevenly across these storage alternatives. Consumers need to be educated on the technical details of these alternatives. Second, consumers will have to decide which data and how much data to share at the point they arrive on the website. Like a Facebook application install dialog box, these cookie dialogs force a consumer to think about the cost/benefit: how much data am I trading for how much gain? It’s a significant cognitive load. Websites must articulate the additional value of user cookies on a user’s very first page view of every session. Third, consumers may need tools to manage their data across the web, the kinds of tools that Facebook, Google and Twitter have already implemented. These tools keep a list of applications accessing user data and allow consumers to revoke access to a given application at any time. The notion of a personal API is inevitable. Both consumer demand and in some geographies, government regulation, is driving the web towards such a structure. Startups and web businesses' marketing is about to change significantly.

On first glance, SMB SaaS companies, those who sell Software-as-a-Service to small to medium businesses, may seem like any other software company. But they are quite a different breed. It’s not just the sales process that differs from traditional software. The entire business has be built differently. So must the product. And typically these products have a 2 step value proposition. SMB SaaS companies sell to a radically different market than enterprise software companies. See the table below. The average traditional enterprise software company sells to firms with 3300 employees whose average payroll is $160M annually. In the US, there are only 17,500 of these firms. On the other hand, SMB SaaS companies sell to firms with 10 employees and $400k in annual payroll. There are about 5.8M of these firms in the US. Encouragingly, the market size for enterprise software is roughly equal to the market size for the SMB market: about 57M potential seats in each. Of course, the true number depends on the market segment: sales, HR, payroll, expense management, etc. But these two markets require very different approaches. Company Size Firms Employees Payroll in $k Employees per Firm Payroll per Firm in $k 1 to 500 5,749,797 56,281,503 2,084,818,973 10 363 Greater than 500 17,509 58,228,123 2,770,726,266 3,326 158,246 Source: US Census SMB SaaS companies need to reach and market to 1,000 times more companies than their enterprise counterparts. Obviously this requires a new sales process. Typically, this sales process leads with a product which excites users and triggers word of mouth sharing, and blog posts, and news articles. Direct sales aren’t profitable at this scale. Instead, mass media channels must be used: press, mobile app stores (iOS & Android), web app stores (Chrome, Google Apps, Intuit and Force). It means every customer support rep must handle hundreds to thousands of customers per year instead of tens of customers. Customer support becomes an inside sales team. They drive upsells and cross-sells, instead of a sales team. In short, the whole organization must be different. Even the product development cycle is different. Without enterprise customers, there are no enterprise commitments. No promises to customers about releasing features on particular dates or paid upgrade cycles. It’s all subscription. Take it or leave it. If the product has to be so different, what seems to be the key to success? The most successful SMB SaaS products typically offer a 2 step value proposition: an initial value proposition to the end user and a longer term value proposition to a manager/decision maker. Take one of our companies, Expensify, which offers simple expense reports to the end user just by scanning receipts. To the controller/VP of Finance, Expensify offers better compliance with spend policies, a huge challenge for most companies of any scale. Similarly, Salesforce offered easier to use CRM to salespeople and better metrics for the sales manager. Yammer offers employees a better communication mechanism and their IT department compliance controls. The end user value proposition drives press and word of mouth sharing. It’s the best angle to benefit from consumer app distribution channels. But the manager value proposition drives conversion to paid accounts. So if you’re serving this market, remember the one-two punch.

A reader asked for an update given the macro changes & the stock market behavior. Here it is: Multiple = -12.6 + 34.1 x Forward_Growth_Rate + 4.2 x Sales_Efficiency Some quick definitions: Multiple is the forward revenue multiple. Take it and multiply your company’s planned revenue (not ARR) next year & you’ll have an estimate of the value of your business if it were traded in the public markets today. Forward_growth_rate: how much the business will grow revenues in the next 12 months Sales_Efficiency: (change in gross profit) / sales_and_marketing expense. In other words, how much marginal gross profit did the sales & marketing investment last period generate. This can be calculated quarterly or annually.
